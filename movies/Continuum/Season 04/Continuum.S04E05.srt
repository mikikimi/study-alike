1
00:00:32,316 --> 00:00:36,985
You want a confession from
me because I'm a villain.

2
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,321
I'm a bad man.

3
00:00:39,355 --> 00:00:42,457
But that's not all I am, is it?

4
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:45,360
I'm a special kind of bad man.

5
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:47,529
A freak.

6
00:00:47,563 --> 00:00:50,799
When people find out about me,

7
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:55,704
they find out about all the
other freaks, as well.

8
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,973
Nobody will believe him if he
says he comes from the future.

9
00:00:58,007 --> 00:00:59,808
Yeah, but he has no past.

10
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:01,877
It doesn't matter if they
don't believe him.

11
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:05,046
We're associated and suddenly I'm suspect.

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,814
You want to tell the
truth about your background?

13
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:07,882
Go ahead.

14
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,150
All that's gonna get you is a life sentence

15
00:01:09,184 --> 00:01:10,485
in the psych ward.

16
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,153
So if that's really where
you want to end up...

17
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:15,423
You still enjoy the
semblance of a free press.

18
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:18,092
Some enterprising reporter will dig around

19
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:22,830
and find out she's as
intriguing and mysterious as I am.

20
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:26,701
Alright Inspector, this
is a mess and you know it.

21
00:01:26,736 --> 00:01:30,004
The use of these
restraints is a human rights violation

22
00:01:30,038 --> 00:01:33,374
and my client has been
held for days without charges.

23
00:01:33,408 --> 00:01:34,608
Carlos can delay this.

24
00:01:34,643 --> 00:01:35,976
We just need a few more days.

25
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,177
He's stuck.

26
00:01:37,211 --> 00:01:39,346
He has to lay charges soon or
this is unlawful detention.

27
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:40,947
It'll compromise the case against Travis.

28
00:01:43,285 --> 00:01:44,318
We have to go.

29
00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:45,319
Kellogg's expecting us.

30
00:01:45,353 --> 00:01:46,119
Lay the charge!

31
00:01:46,154 --> 00:01:47,421
Release the restraints!

32
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,291
We still have plenty of
time to press charges.

33
00:01:50,325 --> 00:01:52,526
I'm not breaking any
federal laws with those restraints.

34
00:01:56,864 --> 00:01:59,900
Except you are a municipal police force.

35
00:01:59,934 --> 00:02:02,435
Not a security arm
with the federal government.

36
00:02:07,975 --> 00:02:09,776
Care enough to deal with me now, Inspector?

37
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:10,911
You want to kill your lawyer?

38
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:12,545
Go ahead, I'll sell tickets.

39
00:02:23,423 --> 00:02:24,723
Is that all you got?

40
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:28,694
You're gonna wish you had let me out

41
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:30,362
when you had the chance.

42
00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:33,132
If you really cared about
protecting Cameron.

43
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:40,105
Hmm.

44
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:12,193
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

45
00:03:16,244 --> 00:03:17,210
Sending you forward in time

46
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:19,679
isn't the most impossible aspect of this.

47
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:20,880
What are you talking about?

48
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:23,617
You have two free radicals who
are essentials to this plan.

49
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:25,818
And free radicals tend to
do whatever the hell they want.

50
00:03:25,853 --> 00:03:27,354
Kellogg is motivated.

51
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:28,855
He needs us to take down those soldiers

52
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,590
before they take him down.

53
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,425
We trust Kellogg to act according to plan?

54
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,229
And Brad makes
Kellogg look like a boy scout.

55
00:03:36,264 --> 00:03:38,898
You're gonna have to find a
way to get him on board somehow.

56
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:41,067
And these guys don't want anything.

57
00:03:42,235 --> 00:03:43,770
Is that all you got?

58
00:03:43,804 --> 00:03:46,572
You're gonna wish you let
me out when you had the chance.

59
00:03:46,606 --> 00:03:48,941
Not very cooperative, is he?

60
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:50,810
Well, he's never
going to admit to anything.

61
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:53,546
We both know I can't hold him
any longer without charges.

62
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,715
Piron doesn't want him in front of a judge.

63
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:57,784
Piron doesn't have jurisdiction.

64
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:01,053
Did you see the medical report

65
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:03,855
after they initially brought him in?

66
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:05,791
Unusual physiology

67
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:12,598
and evidence of experimental
self-healiing nanotechnology.

68
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:14,032
That sounds like science fiction.

69
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,134
Sounds like Piron.

70
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:17,203
They've requested...

71
00:04:17,237 --> 00:04:21,707
No. They've demanded we
hand Travis over to them.

72
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:23,341
If this whole Liber8 thing turns out to be

73
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,911
some kind of Piron project gone awry,

74
00:04:25,945 --> 00:04:28,113
some kind of cover up,

75
00:04:28,147 --> 00:04:30,248
there'll be hell to pay.

76
00:04:30,282 --> 00:04:32,918
Some enterprising reporter will dig around

77
00:04:32,952 --> 00:04:39,091
and find out she's as
intriguing and mysterious as I am.

78
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,259
No more delays.

79
00:04:41,293 --> 00:04:45,029
I don't care who she is and
I don't care what she's done,

80
00:04:45,063 --> 00:04:46,097
I want Liber8 put away

81
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:48,233
and I want to know what
Piron wants with Travis.

82
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,934
You hear me?

83
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:55,406
So I'm interested in the
military technology

84
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:57,141
first and foremost.

85
00:04:57,175 --> 00:04:59,076
I'm sure that's a relief to you, Kiera.

86
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,910
Alec assures me that there's
very little chance

87
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:04,581
I'll be able to travel
forward in time, so...

88
00:05:04,616 --> 00:05:06,783
That's unfortunate.

89
00:05:06,817 --> 00:05:08,385
But if anybody could do it...

90
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:09,586
We have a way to enter their stronghold

91
00:05:09,621 --> 00:05:11,888
with no casualties and no gunfire.

92
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:14,458
We don't want anyone to get hurt.

93
00:05:14,492 --> 00:05:15,792
Care to share how?

94
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:19,796
After you let us use your lab at Piron.

95
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,265
I need to make some
adjustments to the time ball.

96
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:24,667
We need it in order to jam their defenses.

97
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:25,935
Yeah, once I let you in,

98
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,839
what assurance do I have
you're gonna deliver on your promise?

99
00:05:29,874 --> 00:05:32,041
You'll just have to trust us.

100
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:34,343
And leave us alone while we're working.

101
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,484
Yeah, I can do that.

102
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:57,366
Joining me in the dragon's den?

103
00:05:57,401 --> 00:05:58,434
Just visiting.

104
00:05:58,468 --> 00:05:59,402
Like you.

105
00:05:59,436 --> 00:06:00,670
I'm not visiting.

106
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:02,338
I'm a resident.

107
00:06:02,372 --> 00:06:04,473
There's work here I believe in.

108
00:06:04,508 --> 00:06:05,441
You took a hit.

109
00:06:05,475 --> 00:06:07,709
You took it to heart.

110
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:10,078
You have other choices.

111
00:06:10,113 --> 00:06:11,947
We all do.

112
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:13,148
In the fairytales I've read,

113
00:06:13,183 --> 00:06:16,484
the hero enters the
cave to slay the dragon.

114
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,687
Not to join him.

115
00:06:22,558 --> 00:06:23,992
It's good to see you.

116
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,110
You got family coming through?

117
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:44,645
My kid sister and her boyfriend.

118
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:46,647
If they're still alive.

119
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:47,949
What about your mom?

120
00:06:47,983 --> 00:06:49,416
She's afraid she'll be blown apart.

121
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,918
That the technology doesn't work.

122
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:51,986
It's like dying.

123
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,755
You never get a report
back from the other side.

124
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,424
The beacon proved otherwise.

125
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,460
Oh, also
need-to-know?

126
00:06:59,494 --> 00:07:00,861
It's a mission, Tonkin.

127
00:07:00,895 --> 00:07:02,563
You know how it is.

128
00:07:02,597 --> 00:07:04,130
When I left, my sister was dead

129
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:05,833
and now Zorin says she's on the manifest.

130
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:07,568
Zorin didn't make the manifest.

131
00:07:10,238 --> 00:07:10,937
Marcellus?

132
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,873
Marcellus took care of you.

133
00:07:12,907 --> 00:07:15,609
If they're on that
manifest it means they're alive.

134
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:26,118
Here we are.

135
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:27,754
I can set you up with
some lab assistants...

136
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:28,954
Don't need 'em.

137
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:30,356
Kiera will help.

138
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,658
Hmm.

139
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:37,930
She's driving this mission.

140
00:07:37,964 --> 00:07:40,465
But it's flawed, isn't it?

141
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,003
She wants to go home even
though home probably isn't there.

142
00:07:45,037 --> 00:07:47,472
Does she understand that?

143
00:07:47,507 --> 00:07:48,973
There's a chance.

144
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:49,674
A chance?

145
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:52,043
Kid, this isn't Vegas.

146
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:54,646
Are you really gonna roll
the dice with her life?

147
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,948
How is this gonna work, Kellogg?

148
00:07:59,184 --> 00:08:01,286
That's an excellent question.

149
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,424
Ok, so the soldiers asked
me to provide Piron security

150
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,160
after your unscheduled visit.

151
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:10,694
Those men are loyal to me,

152
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:14,365
and they'll turn on Zorin
and his team on my command.

153
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,834
Ok. Sounds feasible.

154
00:08:16,868 --> 00:08:19,804
So, with my help, you and
Alec get inside the building

155
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:23,007
and, along with my
security, you neutralize the soldiers.

156
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:27,044
Alec does his magic and abracadabra,
Kiera disappears.

157
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:30,681
Once you've left us, I destroy the machine

158
00:08:30,715 --> 00:08:35,152
and stop the invasion before it begins.

159
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:37,220
Then what?

160
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:38,856
What do you mean?

161
00:08:41,092 --> 00:08:42,993
What happens with you?

162
00:08:43,027 --> 00:08:47,898
I don't think that's any of
your concern anymore, Kiera.

163
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:50,835
You made your choice.

164
00:08:50,869 --> 00:08:52,670
You chose you.

165
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:02,980
You think I'm being selfish?

166
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:08,651
You're calling Brad, aren't you?

167
00:09:08,686 --> 00:09:10,553
I think it's time we
invite him to the party.

168
00:09:10,588 --> 00:09:13,390
I think I trust him less than Kellogg.

169
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:17,027
Well, we need them both.

170
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:19,696
I know.

171
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,163
I'll be back.

172
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:38,123
I believe you.

173
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:41,426
And I want your help.

174
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,228
What did you have in mind?

175
00:09:43,262 --> 00:09:46,330
Alec says that, with your technology,

176
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:49,700
he has the ability to send me home.

177
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:53,103
And if he can do it for
me, he can do it for you, too.

178
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:58,375
We found something together
because we both lost so much.

179
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,913
But now there's a chance to get it back.

180
00:10:01,947 --> 00:10:05,516
The ability to see our families again.

181
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:08,586
Even if I could, what if I was too late?

182
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,186
I can't do that.

183
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,955
I can't...

184
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:12,990
I can't lose them again.

185
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:14,323
I know.

186
00:10:14,358 --> 00:10:16,526
But there's not much
time, and if you don't want to,

187
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:19,930
I understand.

188
00:10:19,964 --> 00:10:22,032
But I really hope you want to help.

189
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:25,535
We need access to the machine, just once.

190
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,237
It doesn't have to be
dangerous for anybody.

191
00:10:28,272 --> 00:10:32,742
If I did choose to go back,

192
00:10:32,777 --> 00:10:35,411
I wouldn't compromise this mission.

193
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:37,647
I understand.

194
00:10:37,682 --> 00:10:40,148
So I'm going to give you
back the key you requested

195
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:42,117
as a sign of my good faith.

196
00:10:44,955 --> 00:10:46,922
Alec really thinks he can do this?

197
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:54,229
He says "impossible" to me as
often as he says "probable".

198
00:10:54,263 --> 00:10:55,598
But you're willing?

199
00:10:55,632 --> 00:10:57,332
For a chance to see my son?

200
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:02,204
It's possible he may not even be there.

201
00:11:02,238 --> 00:11:05,740
You're really killing the moment.

202
00:11:05,774 --> 00:11:09,978
I just want you to find
what you're looking for.

203
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:11,746
Then help me.

204
00:11:21,657 --> 00:11:23,691
So we're pressing charges tomorrow,

205
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:26,894
but I have a feeling Piron
will try to intercept.

206
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:31,132
So if there's anything you
might want to say to help your case,

207
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,634
now would be the time to do it.

208
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:35,103
Your system will say what it wants.

209
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:37,105
It doesn't matter to me.

210
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:39,573
I'll take us both down.

211
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:42,309
It doesn't matter to Kiera, either.

212
00:11:42,344 --> 00:11:44,145
She's going home.

213
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:45,880
Forward in time?

214
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,048
Mmmhmm.

215
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:51,051
She just woke up and now she
wants to go back to sleep?

216
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,554
You should take me to court now, Inspector.

217
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,122
I'll make sure she stays.

218
00:11:55,157 --> 00:11:59,493
Well, I don't blame her for
wanting to see her kid.

219
00:11:59,528 --> 00:12:02,596
She's still walking out on you.

220
00:12:04,366 --> 00:12:06,267
It's not like that.

221
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:11,272
I'm not gonna hide who I am, Fonnegra.

222
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:12,873
Neither would you.

223
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:19,813
The truth of me reveals the truth of her.

224
00:12:28,156 --> 00:12:30,590
That's a hell of a view, huh?

225
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,625
I always liked it.

226
00:12:35,763 --> 00:12:38,464
What can I do for you, sir?

227
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:43,102
I'm here to take Travis back
to Piron for processing.

228
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:44,837
Don't be so surprised.

229
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,106
You and I both know that
our friend in lockup

230
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,911
pushes the limits of biology
in a way that begs investigation.

231
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:54,346
Kellogg knows more than
he's willing to tell me.

232
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,280
I can live with that,

233
00:12:56,315 --> 00:12:57,882
but I wanted to give
you a chance to tell me

234
00:12:57,917 --> 00:13:01,419
what you know and how
this connects to Kiera.

235
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,100
Kiera, Kellogg and Liber8,

236
00:13:15,134 --> 00:13:18,002
they were sent back in time
from the future to change history.

237
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:32,750
Ok, that's a good one.

238
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:34,552
You understand why I had to ask?

239
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:41,459
Are you ok?

240
00:13:45,497 --> 00:13:48,666
I was looking for a way to be relevant.

241
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,569
After I realized my body was
going to be a liability,

242
00:13:52,603 --> 00:13:56,172
my pride did not allow
me to deal with the truth.

243
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:00,810
Until now.

244
00:14:03,814 --> 00:14:06,082
It's a recording I found
that's going to help you lay charges

245
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:07,884
in the Escher murder.

246
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:13,390
We're in this together.

247
00:14:13,424 --> 00:14:15,358
Sure, you get me to kill Escher for you,

248
00:14:15,393 --> 00:14:16,858
but we're in this together.

249
00:14:16,893 --> 00:14:19,895
You do this, and you're free of me.

250
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,664
Escher used to say that, too.

251
00:14:21,698 --> 00:14:25,967
Once you pull the trigger,
it'll finally be true.

252
00:14:26,002 --> 00:14:28,103
You can get Kellogg on conspiracy
to commit murder.

253
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:30,472
All you have to do is offer Emily a deal

254
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:31,740
to testify against him.

255
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:35,210
Let's bury this son of a bitch!

256
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:36,545
Are you sure about this?

257
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:40,581
You tell your partner I'm
walking out of the cave.

258
00:14:40,616 --> 00:14:41,949
With all her mysteries and missteps,

259
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:45,219
she's always trying to do the right thing.

260
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:48,055
It's time I did the same.

261
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:53,994
So I will be back to
deal with this Travis thing.

262
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:56,030
I hope I can count on you.

263
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:11,778
I'm reprogramming it.

264
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:14,315
The way the time ball uses
the soldier's power source is new,

265
00:15:14,349 --> 00:15:17,584
but the brakes and the
steering wheel are all the same.

266
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:20,154
Except not really.

267
00:15:20,188 --> 00:15:24,224
Well, you only get to use the brakes once.

268
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:28,561
In the future, my
future, if I ever get back,

269
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,764
there are no guarantees.

270
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,700
Sam might not be there.

271
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:38,537
He might not even be.

272
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:42,441
I thought you were
optimistic about Brad helping us.

273
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:46,479
He asked me the questions I'm
afraid to ask of myself.

274
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:56,955
Well, you can always stay here.

275
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,057
Thanks.

276
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,208
Don't stop now.

277
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:27,286
Where's my key, Tonkin?

278
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,587
She has agreed to return it.

279
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,656
In exchange for what?

280
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,358
Doesn't matter.

281
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:34,826
What she wants, no one can give her.

282
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,694
Mmmhmm.

283
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,430
Why does Kellogg want to come here?

284
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:40,898
To this time?

285
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,600
He said it was a turning point.

286
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:46,304
A time when choices could
still be made and have an impact.

287
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,838
Hmm.

288
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:52,176
I don't think there's any right choice.

289
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,145
You'll feel differently

290
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,212
when you see your sister and nephews

291
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,981
come through that portal.

292
00:16:58,015 --> 00:17:00,584
I want to see them, I really do.

293
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:03,286
But I would give
everything I have to go back to 2035.

294
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:05,288
Yeah, we all have our dates.

295
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:06,490
Outcomes we'd like to change.

296
00:17:06,524 --> 00:17:12,629
But this is a one-way flight.

297
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,398
How can you be sure?

298
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:18,769
Commander spent years
trying to build forward travel.

299
00:17:18,803 --> 00:17:21,804
He could see the writing on the wall.

300
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,206
He knew that time travel would be a weapon

301
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,308
that leveled everything.

302
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:28,377
Never cracked it.

303
00:17:28,411 --> 00:17:30,646
He told you this?

304
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:32,915
I have my date, too.

305
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,384
2032.

306
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:38,788
Two children, a wife.

307
00:17:44,694 --> 00:17:48,530
That's it.

308
00:17:48,564 --> 00:17:50,431
Finished.

309
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:51,867
I think I deserve a drink.

310
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:53,401
If that's true, we all do.

311
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:57,271
Come on, Tonkin.

312
00:17:57,306 --> 00:17:58,640
Join us.

313
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:15,188
Will it work?

314
00:18:15,223 --> 00:18:17,825
That's the question I'm
afraid to ask myself.

315
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:19,459
How's it all going?

316
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:26,567
Come on, I thought we
were all on the same team.

317
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:28,902
You didn't think that for an instant.

318
00:18:28,936 --> 00:18:31,137
People change all the time,

319
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:33,406
and there's no time like the present.

320
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,508
Unless my timing is all wrong.

321
00:18:35,543 --> 00:18:36,442
We're done.

322
00:18:36,476 --> 00:18:38,678
I need to take the device somewhere safe.

323
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,287
I've done my part.

324
00:18:48,321 --> 00:18:49,856
How do we proceed?

325
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,823
I'll tell you when you need to know.

326
00:18:51,858 --> 00:18:53,058
You know, there was a
time when that attitude

327
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:54,325
would have thrilled me.

328
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,794
But I got too much at stake now.

329
00:18:55,828 --> 00:18:56,929
This?

330
00:18:56,963 --> 00:19:00,532
Some thing you stole?

331
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:03,268
You know how improbable this has been?

332
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:05,470
Our survival.

333
00:19:05,504 --> 00:19:08,974
What makes you think my life is any
less precious to me than yours is to you?

334
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:10,542
Uh, Kiera?

335
00:19:10,577 --> 00:19:13,578
What? Oh, shit.

336
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:16,281
- I take it this isn't part of the plan.
- No.

337
00:19:16,315 --> 00:19:18,616
Matthew Kellogg, you're under arrest...

338
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,517
Carlos?

339
00:19:19,552 --> 00:19:21,686
For conspiracy in the murder of Escher...

340
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,353
Carlos.

341
00:19:22,388 --> 00:19:23,621
A.K.A. Mark Sadler.

342
00:19:23,655 --> 00:19:26,157
You have the right to retain
and instruct council without delay.

343
00:19:26,192 --> 00:19:27,225
This is a big misunderstanding.

344
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:28,626
Carlos, what are you doing?

345
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,728
If you do not have a
lawyer, we can refer one to you.

346
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:31,329
Was this you?

347
00:19:31,363 --> 00:19:32,429
No, it was not.

348
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,631
Anything you say can be
used as evidence in court.

349
00:19:34,665 --> 00:19:35,432
Carlos, this can wait.

350
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:36,433
I need him now!

351
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:37,234
No.

352
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:38,469
This is murder.

353
00:19:38,503 --> 00:19:39,869
This is happening right here and now.

354
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:42,005
But the thing is we sorta need his help.

355
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,640
Do you understand?

356
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:46,643
Do you wish to speak to a lawyer?

357
00:19:46,677 --> 00:19:49,346
Call Jacqueline right away.

358
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,180
I'll take care of it.

359
00:19:52,949 --> 00:19:55,251
You're going to regret this, Carlos.

360
00:19:55,285 --> 00:19:57,186
I can promise you that.

361
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:06,929
I've been waiting a long time to do that.

362
00:20:06,963 --> 00:20:08,097
If you would just listen to me...

363
00:20:08,132 --> 00:20:09,064
Save it, Kiera.

364
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:11,166
I serve the public, not private concerns.

365
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,068
You should know that by now.

366
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:40,865
Oh good, you're still here.

367
00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:44,402
I probably got half an
hour or so down here.

368
00:20:44,436 --> 00:20:46,270
Um, you... you could try to recruit me

369
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:48,072
to that organization of yours.

370
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:49,440
Um...

371
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:51,109
Liber8?

372
00:20:57,682 --> 00:20:59,150
I'll call you back.

373
00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:01,852
What evidence?

374
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:05,656
An audio recording of
Kellogg ordering the hit on Escher.

375
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,993
Did Dillon bring it to you?

376
00:21:09,027 --> 00:21:12,295
So it's selfish if I want to wait,

377
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,199
but it's not selfish if
you're trying to save Dillon.

378
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,434
That's not what this is about.

379
00:21:17,468 --> 00:21:19,269
Then I guess it has nothing to
do with me leaving, either.

380
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:26,010
Carlos, I know you see
this as a suicide mission.

381
00:21:26,044 --> 00:21:26,809
I do.

382
00:21:26,844 --> 00:21:28,945
But that is my choice to make.

383
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:29,979
Great. I'm not stopping you.

384
00:21:30,014 --> 00:21:31,648
That's exactly what you're doing.

385
00:21:31,682 --> 00:21:32,215
No.

386
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,084
Kiera, we're partners.

387
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:35,285
We're supposed to have each other's back.

388
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,386
I didn't even know you wanted to leave

389
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:38,121
until circumstances forced you to tell me.

390
00:21:38,156 --> 00:21:40,123
Until I could be sure.

391
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:41,558
Also, my choice.

392
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,959
Yeah, well, your choices?

393
00:21:42,993 --> 00:21:45,929
They have an impact on
the people in your life.

394
00:21:45,963 --> 00:21:46,963
You need to take responsibility,

395
00:21:46,997 --> 00:21:48,498
not just for yourself.

396
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:51,567
I have honoured my responsibility
to others.

397
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,768
This department, this city.

398
00:21:52,802 --> 00:21:54,437
Dillon, you, Alec.

399
00:21:54,471 --> 00:21:56,772
I have done right by all of you.

400
00:21:56,806 --> 00:21:58,174
Yes, yes, you have done that.

401
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,376
But you've also done
whatever the hell you wanted to

402
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,811
when it suits you.

403
00:22:02,845 --> 00:22:04,780
This is different.

404
00:22:04,814 --> 00:22:07,049
You hear yourself, right?

405
00:22:07,084 --> 00:22:09,017
You want me to release Kellogg.

406
00:22:09,052 --> 00:22:11,954
You know what he's done, you
know what he's capable of,

407
00:22:11,988 --> 00:22:14,190
and yet you still want him free.

408
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,932
Listen, I'm...

409
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:27,903
I'm sorry about Sonya, by the way.

410
00:22:27,937 --> 00:22:31,539
And Lucas.

411
00:22:31,574 --> 00:22:33,575
Is Garza still alive?

412
00:22:36,713 --> 00:22:40,482
It's hard to believe you're
almost one of us.

413
00:22:40,516 --> 00:22:42,283
What are you talking about?

414
00:22:42,318 --> 00:22:46,021
I'm the embodiment of what
Liber8 was fighting for.

415
00:22:46,055 --> 00:22:47,489
Choice.

416
00:22:47,523 --> 00:22:50,892
Self-determination.

417
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:53,328
Freedom.

418
00:22:53,362 --> 00:22:55,696
Who better represents
those virtues than me?

419
00:22:55,731 --> 00:23:00,001
It's what you do with those virtues.

420
00:23:00,035 --> 00:23:01,936
Sonya.

421
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,071
Lucas.

422
00:23:04,106 --> 00:23:05,706
Jowarski.

423
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:07,808
Kagame.

424
00:23:07,843 --> 00:23:09,777
They built a legacy.

425
00:23:09,811 --> 00:23:12,380
Tens of thousands more
who won't suffer and die

426
00:23:12,414 --> 00:23:14,415
because we changed that future.

427
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,118
What about you?

428
00:23:17,153 --> 00:23:24,392
What will they say
about Travis Verta at the end?

429
00:23:24,426 --> 00:23:28,495
He killed like no other.

430
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:34,434
He terrorized with the best of them.

431
00:23:34,469 --> 00:23:36,236
He'll be out on bail in 24 hours

432
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:37,738
and all of this will be for nothing.

433
00:23:37,773 --> 00:23:40,440
Oh, I wouldn't bet on it.

434
00:23:40,475 --> 00:23:42,076
Is Kellogg the only one you're arresting?

435
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,743
Right on cue.

436
00:23:42,778 --> 00:23:44,178
Special interest number two.

437
00:23:44,212 --> 00:23:45,179
Are you going to arrest Emily?

438
00:23:45,213 --> 00:23:46,947
If I knew where she was.

439
00:23:46,982 --> 00:23:48,783
Now, I could compel
you to give me her location

440
00:23:48,817 --> 00:23:50,584
or you could just be a good citizen.

441
00:23:50,618 --> 00:23:51,886
Carlos, he doesn't know.

442
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,952
I don't.

443
00:23:52,987 --> 00:23:54,120
And you can't trust
Kellogg to tell the truth

444
00:23:54,155 --> 00:23:55,289
about her involvement.

445
00:23:55,323 --> 00:23:56,823
I have evidence.

446
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:01,761
Kellogg blackmailed her.

447
00:24:01,796 --> 00:24:03,530
My father did, too.

448
00:24:03,565 --> 00:24:04,898
Well, we'll have to find that out.

449
00:24:04,932 --> 00:24:05,632
Oh yeah, justice.

450
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:06,900
That always gets to the truth.

451
00:24:06,934 --> 00:24:09,436
Justice, even if that's only a concept,

452
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,671
that's all that I've got.

453
00:24:10,705 --> 00:24:12,672
It works great for those
who can afford to buy it.

454
00:24:12,706 --> 00:24:14,840
Isn't that what you're trying to do?

455
00:24:14,874 --> 00:24:16,141
Huh?

456
00:24:16,176 --> 00:24:18,411
You know, I've tried to
protect you and Kiera along the way,

457
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:20,613
but Kellogg had your father murdered.

458
00:24:20,647 --> 00:24:22,381
Ok? I don't get to look the other way.

459
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:26,319
Not for Kiera, and not for
Kellogg, and not for Travis.

460
00:24:26,353 --> 00:24:29,021
What about Travis?

461
00:24:29,055 --> 00:24:34,459
They'll say "Travis Verta, he was the key.

462
00:24:34,493 --> 00:24:38,663
The key to unlocking the
secrets of a genuine superman.

463
00:24:38,698 --> 00:24:40,699
"The future warrior.

464
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:43,101
"The super-soldier."

465
00:24:43,135 --> 00:24:46,838
I'll be the one keeping your legacy alive

466
00:24:46,872 --> 00:24:52,510
as I patent and replicate every
nano-particle from 2077

467
00:24:52,545 --> 00:24:59,718
inside that bioengineered
hulk you call a body.

468
00:24:59,752 --> 00:25:02,086
Piron doctors want to cut
him open like a guinea pig,

469
00:25:02,121 --> 00:25:03,855
see what makes him so special.

470
00:25:06,891 --> 00:25:09,126
She can't go home now, you realize that.

471
00:25:13,865 --> 00:25:14,831
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

472
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:16,367
Ok? I don't get to make exceptions.

473
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:19,770
That's how the system falls apart.

474
00:25:19,804 --> 00:25:21,772
We can still try to.

475
00:25:21,806 --> 00:25:24,074
We can't get in without
Kellogg and you know it.

476
00:25:28,212 --> 00:25:28,711
It's Brad.

477
00:25:28,746 --> 00:25:31,882
Brad, where are you?

478
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:34,584
Ok, I'll be right there.

479
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:36,419
Maybe he can help.

480
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:40,023
I gotta go.

481
00:25:40,057 --> 00:25:41,958
You're just another CEO

482
00:25:41,993 --> 00:25:46,729
in a long line of
delusional corporate emperors.

483
00:25:46,764 --> 00:25:51,734
And if it's one thing
history has taught us, it's this:

484
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:55,671
Empires eventually crumble.

485
00:25:55,705 --> 00:25:57,439
Oh, don't worry.

486
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,608
In my future that won't happen.

487
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:41,549
Kiera?

488
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:42,350
I'm here.

489
00:26:42,384 --> 00:26:43,818
Brad's here.

490
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,486
No, he's meeting me at the park.

491
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,287
No, he's right here.

492
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,260
They're coming for Kellogg.

493
00:26:53,294 --> 00:26:56,664
Alec, listen to me.

494
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,532
Tell Carlos and get the hell out of there.

495
00:27:04,405 --> 00:27:05,239
Brad's here.

496
00:27:05,273 --> 00:27:06,306
I don't think it's a friendly visit.

497
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:07,841
Check the cameras.

498
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:10,978
He's blacked them out.

499
00:27:11,012 --> 00:27:12,079
Some device.

500
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:14,481
Get out of here.

501
00:27:27,261 --> 00:27:28,527
You just missed Kiera.

502
00:27:28,561 --> 00:27:29,996
Yeah.

503
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,664
What I'd really like
is to bail out Kellogg.

504
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:37,536
Yeah, I've been getting
that offer a lot lately.

505
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,471
Remember that scene
downtown a couple of weeks ago,

506
00:27:39,506 --> 00:27:41,672
torn up buildings, strange fires.

507
00:27:41,707 --> 00:27:42,707
Yeah.

508
00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:44,842
I also remember the people that got hurt.

509
00:27:44,877 --> 00:27:46,278
So neither of us want that again.

510
00:27:50,316 --> 00:27:51,716
Is that a threat?

511
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:58,023
Drop it.

512
00:27:58,057 --> 00:27:59,690
Put your hands up.

513
00:28:09,768 --> 00:28:11,469
That'll be my rescue team.

514
00:28:27,452 --> 00:28:28,485
Henderson, is that you?

515
00:28:49,406 --> 00:28:50,172
Brad's here.

516
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:51,473
Carlos has a gun on him.

517
00:28:51,508 --> 00:28:53,042
I'm gonna check it out and see what...

518
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:58,514
Oh my God.

519
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:02,117
Alec, I have three dead cops down here.

520
00:29:02,152 --> 00:29:04,520
They're after Kellogg.

521
00:29:04,554 --> 00:29:05,954
What the hell is Brad doing?

522
00:29:05,988 --> 00:29:07,022
Carlos just arrested him.

523
00:29:07,057 --> 00:29:08,823
I think he'd be
downstairs if that's all he wanted.

524
00:29:08,858 --> 00:29:10,292
I think he's here for the key.

525
00:29:16,332 --> 00:29:18,233
We didn't come here to kill anyone, Carlos.

526
00:29:18,268 --> 00:29:19,501
But if we're attacked...

527
00:29:19,536 --> 00:29:20,302
Shots fired!

528
00:29:20,336 --> 00:29:21,270
Shots fired!

529
00:29:21,304 --> 00:29:23,472
Release Kellogg, please.

530
00:29:23,506 --> 00:29:24,306
Put it down.

531
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,740
Right now!

532
00:29:25,775 --> 00:29:28,510
Now! Now!

533
00:29:28,545 --> 00:29:31,179
Hurry up, go! Go!

534
00:29:31,213 --> 00:29:33,847
Kier... Kiera?

535
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,017
Alec?

536
00:29:39,288 --> 00:29:40,821
Shit.

537
00:29:45,561 --> 00:29:46,760
What did you do?

538
00:29:49,364 --> 00:29:50,364
Cuff him.

539
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,499
Chris, Kevin, Randy.

540
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:52,633
Come with me.

541
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:09,817
Shit!

542
00:30:28,936 --> 00:30:30,069
Alec?

543
00:30:42,282 --> 00:30:43,282
Clear.

544
00:30:46,353 --> 00:30:47,019
Clear.

545
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:47,886
Move.

546
00:30:53,627 --> 00:30:54,393
Don't move!

547
00:30:54,427 --> 00:30:57,095
Identify yourself!

548
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,830
Do it slowly.

549
00:31:17,817 --> 00:31:19,985
Get back up in here!

550
00:31:22,488 --> 00:31:23,288
Let's go, let's go!

551
00:31:23,322 --> 00:31:24,055
He's out!

552
00:31:29,228 --> 00:31:31,996
You really think you're worth it?

553
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,631
Somebody does.

554
00:31:40,939 --> 00:31:44,475
Go!

555
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,610
Grenade!

556
00:31:45,644 --> 00:31:46,277
Move!

557
00:32:00,391 --> 00:32:02,693
Oh, finally.

558
00:32:12,537 --> 00:32:14,971
Thank you.

559
00:32:15,005 --> 00:32:16,806
Come on, protector.

560
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:18,441
Yeah, come on, protector.

561
00:32:26,784 --> 00:32:28,351
He's close.

562
00:32:28,385 --> 00:32:29,619
First hallway on the right.

563
00:32:29,653 --> 00:32:31,020
Watch my back.

564
00:32:31,055 --> 00:32:32,122
I'll get Kellogg.

565
00:32:32,156 --> 00:32:33,189
Make sure he doesn't take any fire

566
00:32:33,224 --> 00:32:34,824
or Zorin will have our heads.

567
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:36,760
You don't need to remind me.

568
00:32:53,377 --> 00:32:54,443
Damn.

569
00:32:54,478 --> 00:32:56,245
Vasquez, it's empty.

570
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,446
Almost.

571
00:33:03,453 --> 00:33:05,521
Nolan!

572
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:09,957
Target is no longer tracked.

573
00:33:09,992 --> 00:33:12,093
I repeat, we are blind.

574
00:33:39,487 --> 00:33:40,688
Fall back.

575
00:33:40,722 --> 00:33:43,223
We can't get to them this way.

576
00:33:43,257 --> 00:33:44,124
Alright.

577
00:33:44,158 --> 00:33:45,592
Go back up.

578
00:33:49,831 --> 00:33:52,933
Alec, give me the key and we'll go away.

579
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:54,868
Kiera can take her shot, Alec.

580
00:33:54,902 --> 00:33:56,804
But our mission has to come first.

581
00:34:02,343 --> 00:34:03,376
Where is it!

582
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:06,045
Where's what?

583
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,480
Where is it, Alec?

584
00:34:07,514 --> 00:34:08,448
I don't know!

585
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:09,415
I'm sorry, kid.

586
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:11,818
Come on, Alec!

587
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:13,820
Where is it?!

588
00:34:13,854 --> 00:34:16,021
Don't make me break your arm, Alec!

589
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,661
It's nothing personal,
but I've got a deadline.

590
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:26,932
I'm glad to see
you're making better choices.

591
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:28,934
You don't know how much I
hate doing your dirty work.

592
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:30,502
You get me out of this, I swear to you...

593
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:31,403
Save your words, Kellogg.

594
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:32,771
I will do whatever I can to get you...

595
00:34:32,805 --> 00:34:33,705
Cameron!

596
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,840
Move.

597
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:38,410
Let him go!

598
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:39,979
Don't let me go.

599
00:34:40,013 --> 00:34:43,082
You have no idea how important he is.

600
00:34:43,116 --> 00:34:44,283
Go!

601
00:34:58,731 --> 00:35:00,565
Thank you, protector.

602
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:06,571
We need to hold this area.

603
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:07,772
Any word on reinforcements?

604
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:09,207
We're completely cut off.

605
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:11,609
All radio and cell
comms are down in the area.

606
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,344
Where's Alec?

607
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:14,145
Where are we holding Brad?

608
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:15,513
Brad escaped.

609
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:16,547
We haven't found Alec.

610
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,448
What?

611
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:29,860
I got a bad feeling about this.

612
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:32,162
Let him go, Brad.

613
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,531
Give me Kellogg.

614
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:35,032
It serves you, too.

615
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,000
It turns out I'm more
of a cop than I realized.

616
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:44,174
What the hell is that?!

617
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,076
The fail-safe.

618
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:54,517
Move.

619
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,448
Fire! Fire!

620
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,820
Get him out of there!

621
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:40,581
Fall back! Fall back!

622
00:36:42,584 --> 00:36:44,651
Give me Kellogg and all this stops.

623
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:46,020
You could have killed me.

624
00:36:46,054 --> 00:36:48,723
You could have killed Alec,
and yet you keep choosing not to.

625
00:36:48,757 --> 00:36:50,357
It's not what I want, Kiera.

626
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:51,658
It never has been.

627
00:36:51,693 --> 00:36:52,992
Then why?

628
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:54,894
That machine is a portal to my future.

629
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:55,895
I have family there.

630
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,197
They're alive.

631
00:36:57,231 --> 00:36:58,431
You know how that feels.

632
00:37:06,573 --> 00:37:08,074
Grenade!

633
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:10,076
Fall back!

634
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:17,916
Just give him Kellogg.

635
00:37:17,951 --> 00:37:19,151
There's too many dead, now.

636
00:37:19,185 --> 00:37:21,120
And give everyone his future?

637
00:37:29,896 --> 00:37:31,430
Your friends are dying down there, Kiera.

638
00:37:31,465 --> 00:37:34,099
You can stop this.

639
00:37:34,134 --> 00:37:35,400
Make the right choice.

640
00:37:37,536 --> 00:37:39,103
I can call them off.

641
00:37:48,213 --> 00:37:50,348
Ok, deal!

642
00:37:50,383 --> 00:37:51,449
Kellogg for Alec!

643
00:38:07,465 --> 00:38:09,300
Stand down, Vasquez!

644
00:38:36,927 --> 00:38:38,227
Kiera, please don't.

645
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:41,297
I'm just a walking kidney transplant
for my future self.

646
00:38:41,331 --> 00:38:42,364
I have no choice.

647
00:38:42,398 --> 00:38:44,166
You know that.

648
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:45,667
You just keep playing along.

649
00:38:45,702 --> 00:38:47,069
I'll come for you.

650
00:38:47,103 --> 00:38:48,804
You'll let me into that building,

651
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:50,439
the plan moves ahead.

652
00:38:50,473 --> 00:38:52,074
I promise.

653
00:39:29,344 --> 00:39:30,911
Rollins, you've got 20
seconds to get to the roof

654
00:39:30,945 --> 00:39:32,480
or I leave without you!

655
00:39:32,514 --> 00:39:34,482
I got one more thing to deal with.

656
00:39:43,457 --> 00:39:45,291
You can still go home.

657
00:39:45,325 --> 00:39:47,126
After the invasion.

658
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,660
It won't matter.

659
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:49,863
You won't be here.

660
00:39:49,897 --> 00:39:52,198
All this time,

661
00:39:52,232 --> 00:39:54,834
and you still have no idea who I am.

662
00:40:08,882 --> 00:40:12,018
Travis... wh... what are you doing?

663
00:40:12,052 --> 00:40:13,485
Get out of here.

664
00:40:16,924 --> 00:40:17,956
Vasquez!

665
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,791
Go!

666
00:40:18,825 --> 00:40:20,191
Go, go, go!

667
00:40:26,933 --> 00:40:28,066
Everyone, get out!

668
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,148
Time's up.

669
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:04,401
This place is a write-off.

670
00:41:04,436 --> 00:41:07,037
Like my dream of going home.

671
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,639
You can't give up now.

672
00:41:09,674 --> 00:41:11,208
We don't have Brad.

673
00:41:11,242 --> 00:41:13,543
Well, apparently we never did.

674
00:41:13,578 --> 00:41:15,412
We have a new man on the inside.

675
00:41:15,447 --> 00:41:16,746
Kellogg.

676
00:41:16,781 --> 00:41:18,181
Yeah, the one and only.

677
00:41:18,215 --> 00:41:19,715
For now.

678
00:41:19,749 --> 00:41:21,417
Are you trying to get rid of me?

679
00:41:21,452 --> 00:41:24,053
I definitely am.

680
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:30,793
Did we lose Travis?

681
00:41:30,827 --> 00:41:33,229
Yeah.

682
00:41:33,263 --> 00:41:36,599
Yeah, he helped save a lot
of lives, including mine.

683
00:41:36,633 --> 00:41:41,370
He had a chance to walk, but he didn't.

684
00:41:41,404 --> 00:41:44,940
You know, Nora's going to
have a lot of questions.

685
00:41:44,975 --> 00:41:47,843
I'm not sure we have the answers for her.

686
00:41:47,878 --> 00:41:49,344
I'll take the heat.

687
00:41:51,414 --> 00:41:53,148
Alec, give us a sec, would you?

688
00:41:53,182 --> 00:41:54,817
Yeah, sure thing.

689
00:41:57,686 --> 00:42:00,255
What the hell happened to Kellogg?

690
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:01,589
I had to let him go.

691
00:42:01,624 --> 00:42:02,391
Goddammit, Kiera.

692
00:42:02,425 --> 00:42:04,859
I had no choice.

693
00:42:04,894 --> 00:42:07,329
Brad was holding Alec at gunpoint.

694
00:42:07,363 --> 00:42:09,264
You wanted Kellogg in the wind.

695
00:42:09,298 --> 00:42:12,167
At least that was the play earlier today.

696
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:16,304
What I said, about wanting to see Sam,

697
00:42:16,339 --> 00:42:19,607
nothing has ever been truer for me.

698
00:42:19,642 --> 00:42:22,209
But every one of us getting what we want

699
00:42:22,244 --> 00:42:24,145
when we want it?

700
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:26,714
I know it doesn't work that way.

701
00:42:30,052 --> 00:42:33,021
I don't want to lose you.

702
00:42:33,055 --> 00:42:37,191
And sometimes I don't want to go, either.

703
00:42:39,627 --> 00:42:42,996
Well, with the way things are playing out

704
00:42:43,031 --> 00:42:47,435
we may be stuck with each other for good.

705
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:49,437
Kiera, can't you just
give up this fantasy, ok?

706
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:52,273
Come back to reality,
as hard as that may be?

707
00:42:52,307 --> 00:42:54,075
Whatever your plan was,

708
00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:56,343
Brad blew it apart when
he blew this place up.

709
00:42:56,378 --> 00:42:57,044
Ok?

710
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:58,811
I'm going to destroy the asshole

711
00:42:58,845 --> 00:43:00,080
that did this to me and my people,

712
00:43:00,114 --> 00:43:03,883
so you tell me where he is right now.
