1
00:00:32,923 --> 00:00:35,224
Now things were gonna
play out great for us.

2
00:00:35,225 --> 00:00:38,627
And they did for about six
years until it all went to shit.

3
00:00:38,628 --> 00:00:40,562
Economic collapse, social unrest.

4
00:00:40,563 --> 00:00:42,932
It's a goddamn mess.

5
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:44,100
Thought we'd ride it out in style,

6
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:48,104
but from where I'm standing,
there's no clear end game.

7
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:50,672
That's why I'm pulling the rip chord early.

8
00:00:50,673 --> 00:00:53,943
I want you to have the fighting
chance that I never did.

9
00:00:53,944 --> 00:00:56,745
You can get the advantage years
before the game even starts.

10
00:00:56,746 --> 00:00:59,681
We can call this one early.

11
00:00:59,682 --> 00:01:00,883
I'd tell you what's coming,

12
00:01:00,884 --> 00:01:04,520
but the whole point of this
exercise is to change that.

13
00:01:04,521 --> 00:01:05,987
Ring a bell?

14
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:11,192
So bottom line: trust my team.

15
00:01:11,193 --> 00:01:12,661
They know what they're doing,

16
00:01:12,662 --> 00:01:14,863
but they're gonna need your
help with some logistics.

17
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:16,899
Equipment, manpower.

18
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,199
What I need from you is to understand

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,003
that you can't always do it alone.

20
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:25,407
You need to trust me on that.

21
00:01:25,408 --> 00:01:26,942
Call it whatever you want.

22
00:01:26,943 --> 00:01:31,112
Guidance, assistance, fatherly advice.

23
00:01:31,113 --> 00:01:35,116
Maybe that's a bridge too far.

24
00:01:35,117 --> 00:01:37,252
You know how we do business.

25
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,721
What I'm saying is

26
00:01:40,722 --> 00:01:43,624
don't judge me by you.

27
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:47,528
We're in this together.

28
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:49,129
See you around, pal.

29
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:56,236
Holy shit.

30
00:02:29,837 --> 00:02:32,506
The technology has gone in a
completely different direction.

31
00:02:32,507 --> 00:02:35,375
Brad described his future as total anarchy.

32
00:02:35,376 --> 00:02:36,877
There's no politics in
military development,

33
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:39,546
you just keep pushing the
kill ratio higher and higher.

34
00:02:39,547 --> 00:02:42,482
And that's not political?

35
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:43,916
Here, you wanted this?

36
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:45,418
Oh, yeah.

37
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:46,386
Yeah, I wanted to break it down

38
00:02:46,387 --> 00:02:47,853
and see what they're basing their tech on.

39
00:02:50,891 --> 00:02:51,991
That's my Kellogg alert.

40
00:02:58,565 --> 00:03:00,333
Emily!

41
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:01,934
He wouldn't.

42
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:03,936
Yes, he would.

43
00:03:03,937 --> 00:03:05,070
<i>Cute picture, huh?</i>

44
00:03:05,071 --> 00:03:06,705
Where is she?

45
00:03:06,706 --> 00:03:08,040
How would I know that?

46
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,375
I found that picture online somewhere.

47
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:12,011
It's not the greatest
selfie I've ever seen,

48
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:15,047
but there is no accounting for taste.

49
00:03:15,048 --> 00:03:18,017
What do you want, Kellogg?

50
00:03:18,018 --> 00:03:19,985
This is adorable.

51
00:03:19,986 --> 00:03:21,921
The two people I want to
speak to most in the world

52
00:03:21,922 --> 00:03:23,888
and here they are.

53
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:24,923
<i>You know, I can't help but feel</i>

54
00:03:24,924 --> 00:03:27,059
<i>I had a hand in putting
you two back together.</i>

55
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,160
I'll kill you!

56
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:29,494
You won't, champ.

57
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:33,298
What you will do is return my goodies.

58
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:35,467
And once you do that,

59
00:03:35,468 --> 00:03:38,070
I bet the next picture will be way cuter.

60
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:39,404
I'll be in touch.

61
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:44,241
He's pissed that you hacked into Piron.

62
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:46,177
Not your best idea.

63
00:03:46,178 --> 00:03:48,546
That hack got all the info
about Piron's anti-matter lab

64
00:03:48,547 --> 00:03:50,347
and any other time travel
related nugget I could find

65
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:51,916
because I thought I could get you home.

66
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:54,619
And I wish you could.

67
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,821
But that's not the only reason you did it.

68
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:01,826
I'll return his stuff.

69
00:04:01,827 --> 00:04:04,161
But that means Kellogg owns
all the time travel cards again.

70
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:06,464
What can he do with it, really?

71
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:08,899
That technology is useless to him

72
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,901
without a time travel device.

73
00:04:15,407 --> 00:04:17,108
Kellogg has the other device?

74
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:18,375
Yeah.

75
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:20,744
And those soldiers and whatever
they brought to the party.

76
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:22,713
We cannot allow Kellogg
access to time travel,

77
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:24,014
not ever.

78
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:26,717
I can... I can delay him, I can send a code

79
00:04:26,718 --> 00:04:28,852
that maybe damages his
circuits and delicate equipment,

80
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:31,922
but he'll eventually figure it out.

81
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:33,056
Plus, how am I supposed to send you home

82
00:04:33,057 --> 00:04:36,226
if I damage all the equipment?

83
00:04:36,227 --> 00:04:38,361
But, if I don't stop him then
he's just going to time travel

84
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:41,832
and kill us all and Emily.

85
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,734
We have to play this very smart.

86
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:48,437
Yes, you do.

87
00:05:15,622 --> 00:05:18,372
<b>sync by parlobrito, corrections by Caio
www.addic7ed.com</b>

88
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:26,838
It's gonna take at least six
hours to put all the data back

89
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,039
on this drive.

90
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,209
If you stole it online why
can't you return it that way?

91
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,778
Because that way he doesn't get
the pleasure of your company.

92
00:05:35,114 --> 00:05:36,781
You're supposed to deliver
it to him personally

93
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:38,282
and wait with him while
his engineers make sure

94
00:05:38,283 --> 00:05:39,650
that it's all fully restored.

95
00:05:39,651 --> 00:05:42,386
Great.

96
00:05:42,387 --> 00:05:44,255
We should tell Carlos about the kidnapping.

97
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:45,989
And risk Emily's life? No.

98
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,658
No, I'm not going to lose her again.

99
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:50,261
He could at least help us
create an insurance policy

100
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:52,263
in case Kellogg betrays us.

101
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:54,764
You mean when he betrays us.

102
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:57,300
Alec, I'll talk to Carlos.

103
00:05:57,301 --> 00:05:59,936
He won't do anything to endanger Emily.

104
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:03,740
Ok. Make sure.

105
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:04,974
Let me know when you're done downloading.

106
00:06:04,975 --> 00:06:06,276
Yeah.

107
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:19,755
Hey, it's Alec.

108
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:22,023
I could use some help.

109
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:23,125
<i>Sir?</i>

110
00:06:23,126 --> 00:06:24,826
This is Marcellus.

111
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:29,665
Commander.

112
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,267
You hear that, Jacqueline?

113
00:06:31,268 --> 00:06:33,669
Definitely my preferred title from now on.

114
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:38,840
You understand my meaning, sir?

115
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:40,642
Commander?

116
00:06:40,643 --> 00:06:41,810
I saw the hologram message,

117
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:43,211
if that's what you are referring to.

118
00:06:43,212 --> 00:06:45,280
I didn't age as well as I expected.

119
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:47,783
Times have been hard.

120
00:06:47,784 --> 00:06:50,451
Which is why I'm here.

121
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,621
I need you to help me
acquire that list of supplies.

122
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:54,923
Wow.

123
00:06:54,924 --> 00:06:56,557
This is going to cost a fortune.

124
00:06:56,558 --> 00:06:58,293
There's more.

125
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:02,663
I'm going to need a work
crew and that building.

126
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:03,764
I have plenty of buildings.

127
00:07:03,765 --> 00:07:07,634
No, it has to be that one.

128
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:11,899
Ok, I'll... I'll see what I can do.

129
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:16,143
So are you guys planning
a real estate take-over

130
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,411
or something?

131
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:20,147
Do we renovate our way to a better future?

132
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,316
There's work to do.

133
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:26,620
Use this to cover costs.

134
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:31,825
What kind of work?

135
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,661
If he didn't tell you, I can't.

136
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,895
So I'm just supposed to trust-

137
00:07:35,896 --> 00:07:38,832
You. Yes.

138
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,734
Why would you in the future
endanger you in the now?

139
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:44,771
That makes no sense.

140
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:46,306
No, it doesn't, does it?

141
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:52,974
Commander, in my future this
world has been torn apart.

142
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,482
Before I left

143
00:07:56,483 --> 00:08:00,920
you told me that this mission
could change everything.

144
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:04,508
Save millions of lives
and avoid that future.

145
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:09,262
You told me-

146
00:08:09,263 --> 00:08:10,997
Yeah?

147
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:13,833
You told me that you would lead us.

148
00:08:15,268 --> 00:08:16,568
Please don't.

149
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:17,635
The kidnapper confessed to you.

150
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:19,171
Of course we're picking him up.

151
00:08:19,172 --> 00:08:21,606
He'll have her killed, you know that.

152
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:23,375
I'm not just gonna let it lie.

153
00:08:23,376 --> 00:08:24,709
Kellogg needs to understand
that taking over Piron

154
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,778
does not give him a pass on crime.

155
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,513
Right now it is too risky for Emily.

156
00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:30,448
I thought you would understand.

157
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:36,454
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:38,456 --> 00:08:40,925
Seriously, what the hell
is going on with you?

159
00:08:45,764 --> 00:08:47,999
I had a dream.

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,434
I was back in my time.

161
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:52,603
I saw Sam.

162
00:08:52,604 --> 00:08:54,972
He was ten.

163
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:57,041
So handsome.

164
00:08:57,042 --> 00:08:59,911
That must have been rough.

165
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:03,447
It was rough waking up.

166
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:07,183
I wanted to stay there forever.

167
00:09:07,184 --> 00:09:09,286
I just want my old life back.

168
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:12,989
My son.

169
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,626
And it's never gonna happen, so...

170
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:24,167
You know I won't let
Kellogg get away with this.

171
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:27,337
Or anything, for that matter.

172
00:09:27,338 --> 00:09:30,573
But we have to be smart about it.

173
00:09:30,574 --> 00:09:32,374
He's not just gonna be
keeping her in a guest room

174
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,944
or any Piron property, for that matter.

175
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:37,279
He will use his people, though.

176
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,516
And if you put surveillance
on his security forces,

177
00:09:40,517 --> 00:09:43,586
it might lead us right to her.

178
00:09:43,587 --> 00:09:45,488
Yeah, I can do that.

179
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:47,389
But I'm also paying him a visit.

180
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,659
He'll be suspicious if I didn't.

181
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:57,999
Look, Kiera, if you really
could go home, would-

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,168
In a heartbeat.

183
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:14,248
I have to go.

184
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:25,326
Find any way of doing it?

185
00:10:25,327 --> 00:10:26,727
You know the first thing
Kellogg's skeeze corp

186
00:10:26,728 --> 00:10:28,329
will look for is a virus.

187
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,632
Send in a virus, who catches a cold?

188
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:33,134
Emily does.

189
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:35,003
Not if it's in a pre-existing one.

190
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:35,736
There's bound to be something,

191
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:36,770
no system is that clean.

192
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:38,039
This one seems to be.

193
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,240
It is.

194
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:41,041
There were mouse holes,
mouse holes everywhere.

195
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:43,477
But then I sent in the digital cat...

196
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:44,478
no more mice.

197
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:45,546
Crap.

198
00:10:45,547 --> 00:10:47,815
I hate feeling this powerless.

199
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:49,917
We're better off stripping
out some of these files.

200
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:51,118
You can't miss what's not there,

201
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:52,987
and I don't want to send these back.

202
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:55,055
Weapons, drones, missiles?

203
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:57,057
Piron is deep in the military R and D

204
00:10:57,058 --> 00:10:59,292
and murder is the least of it.

205
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:00,593
That wasn't me, ok?

206
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:01,495
It was other me.

207
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:04,031
Other you was you all the way through.

208
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,499
Other you changed fast.

209
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,334
He certainly embraced his inner shitheel.

210
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:08,801
That guy was mad at the world

211
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,338
because his heart was broken.

212
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,507
If you plant something and you get caught

213
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:16,076
and Emily's already caught
and in the mouse trap,

214
00:11:16,077 --> 00:11:17,844
now how's your heart gonna do then?

215
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,878
Jason's got a point, Alec.

216
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,014
Actions have consequences.

217
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,417
We all know where I end up.

218
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,388
I'm getting Emily back.

219
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:33,426
And I don't have to
become asshole me to do it.

220
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,561
Or do I?

221
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,172
When you went off that building, I-

222
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,906
Are you ok?

223
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:51,008
Are they following you?

224
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:52,243
It's fine.

225
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,545
I'm on a supply run.

226
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,980
I'm the guy who knows the city best.

227
00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:58,783
Here.

228
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,384
Thanks.

229
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:03,153
I'm gonna stay embedded for now.

230
00:12:03,154 --> 00:12:05,422
See if I can find out what they're up to.

231
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:07,257
They haven't told you?

232
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:08,459
The mission is
need-to-know,

233
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,662
and apparently I don't need to know.

234
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:15,966
They don't trust you
because they saw us together.

235
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:18,868
Because I'm supposed to be dead.

236
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:21,738
Marcellus seems to be accepting my reasons.

237
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:23,640
That I'm playing you,

238
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:26,742
you're a source of valuable information.

239
00:12:26,743 --> 00:12:29,645
I used the same line with Carlos about you.

240
00:12:29,646 --> 00:12:33,649
Let's hope it holds for both of us.

241
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,486
I can hold off the police for a while,

242
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:40,523
but I'm gonna need to
give Carlos something.

243
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:42,825
Marcellus is meeting with Kellogg.

244
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,360
Now.

245
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:46,829
That's all I know.

246
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,600
What have you got for me?

247
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:53,235
Tell them they think it's Liber8.

248
00:12:53,236 --> 00:12:56,804
Nobody's looking for your guys.

249
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:59,307
Is that all?

250
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:01,476
Yes.

251
00:13:01,477 --> 00:13:02,910
You took something from them.

252
00:13:02,911 --> 00:13:04,679
Thin, looks like a pen?

253
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,047
They need it back.

254
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:07,449
Sure.

255
00:13:10,553 --> 00:13:11,486
We're only gonna get through this

256
00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:14,256
if we trust each other, Kiera.

257
00:13:14,257 --> 00:13:15,757
I trust you.

258
00:13:19,628 --> 00:13:21,562
I trust you, too.

259
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:34,899
Ah, the new inspector.

260
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,934
Still no epaulettes, huh?

261
00:13:36,935 --> 00:13:38,570
I definitely see you in epaulettes.

262
00:13:38,571 --> 00:13:40,505
Why don't you tell me
about Emily's disappearance?

263
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:42,374
I was just asking myself the same thing.

264
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,376
Emily, how come I never see her anymore?

265
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:45,910
Cut the shit, Kellogg.

266
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:47,145
You can either help me now,

267
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:49,748
or you're going to be asking
for help later from behind bars.

268
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:52,584
You're asking me about
somebody I got no interest in.

269
00:13:52,585 --> 00:13:54,386
But I'll tell you something for free.

270
00:13:54,387 --> 00:13:55,653
Liber8.

271
00:13:55,654 --> 00:13:57,354
This is definitely their kind of operation.

272
00:13:57,355 --> 00:13:59,223
Their kind of operation?

273
00:13:59,224 --> 00:14:00,557
Kidnapping.

274
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:02,293
I said "disappearance".

275
00:14:02,294 --> 00:14:04,061
Subtext.

276
00:14:15,674 --> 00:14:17,908
I believe you two know each other.

277
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:22,846
It's good to see you, sir.

278
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:25,148
It's just Jack now, Inspector.

279
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:26,649
I'm just keeping the chair warm for you.

280
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,518
Don't.

281
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:32,488
This broken body is cashing out.

282
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:34,157
You don't have to work for this shithead.

283
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:37,627
Piron can always use additional
experienced security personnel,

284
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,862
Inspector Fonnegra.

285
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:49,706
You're gonna slip up, Kellogg.

286
00:14:49,707 --> 00:14:54,109
And when you do, I'm going to be there.

287
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,616
Sir.

288
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,026
Is there something you wanted me to do?

289
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:15,630
Um, you pretty much just did it.

290
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,205
I don't have to worry
about you and Carlos, do I?

291
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:27,541
Is history going to trump our arrangement?

292
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:32,446
I have no intention of biting the hand,

293
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:34,615
if that's what you're asking.

294
00:15:34,616 --> 00:15:37,252
Let's say um...

295
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:43,218
just for fun, that I've
done something... illegal.

296
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:48,862
Then uh... what happens then?

297
00:15:48,863 --> 00:15:51,899
That's what you have lawyers for.

298
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,837
You done yet?

299
00:15:57,838 --> 00:15:59,172
Getting there.

300
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:00,807
That's helpful.

301
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:02,042
You're right.

302
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:03,176
I am being helpful.

303
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:05,345
If you both should take it down a notch.

304
00:16:05,346 --> 00:16:07,214
I'm sorry, it's just...

305
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:09,481
here I am again, behind the monitors,

306
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:13,752
keystroking my way to a
solution instead of saving Emily.

307
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:16,155
On the masculinity scale
I'm pulling in the negatives.

308
00:16:16,156 --> 00:16:19,325
Do you want Emily saved
or your self-esteem?

309
00:16:25,232 --> 00:16:26,498
The hard-drive done?

310
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:27,133
Lucas?

311
00:16:27,134 --> 00:16:28,801
Minutes away.

312
00:16:35,107 --> 00:16:36,308
Anything?

313
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:38,977
Yeah, I got all my cars on
two Piron security positions.

314
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:42,981
Ok, I'm on my way to meet Kellogg now.

315
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:44,950
You know he suggested that
Liber8 was behind this?

316
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:46,217
<i>Of course he did.</i>

317
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:48,653
Because if you take out Liber8
you remove a problem for him.

318
00:16:48,654 --> 00:16:50,422
<i>Yeah, and for me.</i>

319
00:16:50,423 --> 00:16:52,790
It gave me a taste for the
pressure Dhillon was under.

320
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,191
Nora keeps looking for forward momentum

321
00:16:54,192 --> 00:16:55,560
on that incursion the other night.

322
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:57,227
Look, I talked to Brad.

323
00:16:57,228 --> 00:16:58,763
He suggested that we stand down

324
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:01,599
until he has a better
idea of what's going on.

325
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,201
Not to mention how
dangerous those guys are.

326
00:17:04,202 --> 00:17:06,504
<i>And you trust him?</i>

327
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:07,805
Yes.

328
00:17:07,806 --> 00:17:10,040
Alright, I want you to solve, and soon.

329
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,142
There's gonna be another
ass sitting in this chair.

330
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:14,378
A person who might like the
idea of corporate policing.

331
00:17:14,379 --> 00:17:15,745
I get it.

332
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:17,181
Oh, and Dhillon was there.

333
00:17:17,182 --> 00:17:18,682
He's working for Kellogg.

334
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,986
He's upset.

335
00:17:21,987 --> 00:17:23,454
He's angry.

336
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,189
It won't last.

337
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,756
Transfer is done.

338
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:27,224
I gotta go.

339
00:17:27,225 --> 00:17:28,092
It's time.

340
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:29,960
You be careful, huh?

341
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,553
So it's true.

342
00:17:57,554 --> 00:17:59,822
What?

343
00:17:59,823 --> 00:18:04,026
Oh, that I'm Matthew Kellogg's bagman.

344
00:18:04,027 --> 00:18:07,295
Apparently so.

345
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:10,132
Are you alright?

346
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:14,302
I know what I'm doing.

347
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:15,437
Here.

348
00:18:16,872 --> 00:18:18,140
He insisted.

349
00:18:18,141 --> 00:18:21,809
You can leave your things
in the ladies' room.

350
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,346
I am not Matthew Kellogg's dress-up doll.

351
00:18:24,347 --> 00:18:26,481
It's this or nothing.

352
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:28,750
He said you'd understand the stakes.

353
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:30,152
Do you?

354
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:35,524
Enjoy your lunch.

355
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:49,604
<i>I hope it works out.</i>

356
00:18:49,605 --> 00:18:51,105
<i>But Kellogg?</i>

357
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:54,075
Kiera has a way with...

358
00:18:54,076 --> 00:18:56,710
A way with what?

359
00:18:56,711 --> 00:18:58,812
I'm tracking a lot of
text and phone traffic

360
00:18:58,813 --> 00:19:02,248
coming from Piron phones.

361
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:04,918
Just another bonus from our hack.

362
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,487
I collected all the internal
numbers from Piron Security.

363
00:19:07,488 --> 00:19:08,889
Now, I can't eavesdrop yet,

364
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,991
but I can see their data usage.

365
00:19:10,992 --> 00:19:12,693
That's a lot of phones on locations.

366
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,062
You can't possibly check them all out.

367
00:19:15,063 --> 00:19:17,830
True, but if I'm Kellogg

368
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:19,699
and I'm in the illegal detention business

369
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,367
and I want to keep my victim somewhere

370
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,536
with ultimate deniability...

371
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,604
And what better place

372
00:19:24,605 --> 00:19:28,908
than a property that you
don't own but you control.

373
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:31,377
I found five that fit the profile so far.

374
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,513
Take a look at this.

375
00:19:33,514 --> 00:19:35,281
City records say it's
been vacant for months

376
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:37,683
but the security feed that I hacked into

377
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:39,119
tells a different story.

378
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,020
No activity until yesterday.

379
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:43,555
We can cross reference these Piron numbers

380
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,857
from this location with
nearby cellphone towers

381
00:19:45,858 --> 00:19:47,192
and see if there's some
interesting conversations

382
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:48,093
we can listen in on.

383
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:49,328
Can you do that?

384
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:50,562
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

385
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:52,931
You're not gonna...

386
00:19:52,932 --> 00:19:55,167
This is your superpower.

387
00:19:55,168 --> 00:19:56,067
Don't start trying to-

388
00:19:56,068 --> 00:19:57,702
I know, alright?

389
00:19:57,703 --> 00:20:00,205
Let me know if you find something.

390
00:20:16,555 --> 00:20:18,422
This is bullshit.

391
00:20:18,423 --> 00:20:21,059
I can't have you in that thing,

392
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,727
and why would I when
I can have you in that.

393
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:30,901
You might as well sit.

394
00:20:30,902 --> 00:20:33,603
The food is impressive, and
you're not going anywhere

395
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:35,973
until that drive has been verified.

396
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,810
Relax.

397
00:20:39,811 --> 00:20:43,213
Enjoy yourself.

398
00:20:43,214 --> 00:20:46,916
Homicide is not on tonight's...

399
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:47,917
menu.

400
00:20:47,918 --> 00:20:50,387
I hope that was expensive.

401
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:51,721
Bottoms up.

402
00:20:51,722 --> 00:20:54,491
You need to prove to me
that Emily is still alive.

403
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,926
Hmm...

404
00:21:07,305 --> 00:21:10,072
She's not a piece of meat, man.

405
00:21:10,073 --> 00:21:10,806
Good girl.

406
00:21:10,807 --> 00:21:12,241
Get her on the chair. Come on.

407
00:21:16,313 --> 00:21:19,881
If you try to ransom
me, it's not gonna work.

408
00:21:19,882 --> 00:21:21,517
No one I know trusts Kellogg.

409
00:21:21,518 --> 00:21:23,319
Kellogg who?

410
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,721
Tell me he's going to jail for this.

411
00:21:27,224 --> 00:21:28,657
Maybe we should clean her up a little.

412
00:21:28,658 --> 00:21:31,693
I don't see the point.

413
00:21:31,694 --> 00:21:34,895
She won't be around that much longer.

414
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:36,097
Grab me proof of life.

415
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:38,333
Let's go.

416
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:39,767
Smile.

417
00:21:42,705 --> 00:21:43,705
Got it yet?

418
00:21:43,706 --> 00:21:44,239
Yeah.

419
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,107
Let's go. Come on.

420
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,425
You called it.

421
00:22:05,426 --> 00:22:07,060
There is definitely a cell phone in there

422
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:08,762
connecting with Kellogg.

423
00:22:08,763 --> 00:22:09,496
I'm working on that address.

424
00:22:09,497 --> 00:22:11,565
It might take a few minutes.

425
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,471
So, can I order another bottle?

426
00:22:18,472 --> 00:22:20,839
Now that we know I'm holding up my end.

427
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,249
You sure you still want to do this?

428
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,851
She should dine with a
better class of people.

429
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,219
Collateral damage.

430
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,688
It's unfortunate.

431
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:38,257
She was beginning to show some promise.

432
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:40,192
People make their choices.

433
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:43,695
She made hers.

434
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,157
Without a leader, those
soldiers could be useful.

435
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,671
New recruits, I like it.

436
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:11,321
So tell me: if you could have anything.

437
00:23:11,322 --> 00:23:12,655
Anything.

438
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:15,058
What would it be?

439
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:18,094
It doesn't matter.

440
00:23:18,095 --> 00:23:20,997
You'd go back.

441
00:23:20,998 --> 00:23:22,699
Still.

442
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,102
To that shithole of a future we came from?

443
00:23:32,643 --> 00:23:36,746
Well, I may be able to help you.

444
00:23:36,747 --> 00:23:38,581
Not without Alec, you can't.

445
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:41,083
And you burned that bridge.

446
00:23:41,084 --> 00:23:43,252
To kidnapping?

447
00:23:43,253 --> 00:23:44,854
We can't drink to that.

448
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:46,756
It's too close to a confession.

449
00:23:46,757 --> 00:23:49,225
To world domination, then?

450
00:23:49,226 --> 00:23:52,127
You've got your own small, modern army.

451
00:23:52,128 --> 00:23:54,129
This future, you have a plan?

452
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,332
Is it devious?

453
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,835
Could be.

454
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:01,371
What did Brad tell you about future me?

455
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,175
You're out of your own loop.

456
00:24:09,245 --> 00:24:11,880
The soldiers are here to
create a better future.

457
00:24:11,881 --> 00:24:15,283
One I helped make.

458
00:24:15,284 --> 00:24:16,585
I think you're running scared

459
00:24:16,586 --> 00:24:19,554
because you don't know
if you can trust them.

460
00:24:19,555 --> 00:24:22,190
And you need Alec, but
he's not here to help.

461
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:23,392
You can help him see the merit

462
00:24:23,393 --> 00:24:25,960
in letting bygones be bygones.

463
00:24:30,732 --> 00:24:33,401
Release Emily right now.

464
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:37,038
A little show of good faith
before you verify the data.

465
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,574
Then maybe you can rebuild that bridge.

466
00:24:40,575 --> 00:24:42,911
Alright.

467
00:24:42,912 --> 00:24:44,178
I'll do it.

468
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:49,350
And you can tell Alec that I'm...

469
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:58,392
Did Alec tell you who's bearing
an encryption code on my data?

470
00:24:58,393 --> 00:24:59,593
He wouldn't do that.

471
00:24:59,594 --> 00:25:01,328
Except he did.

472
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:04,164
I want clean data disks
or a key to turn it off.

473
00:25:04,165 --> 00:25:06,534
Otherwise, we're finished here.

474
00:25:06,535 --> 00:25:07,501
And I'm making a call

475
00:25:07,502 --> 00:25:09,603
to ensure someone else is finished as well.

476
00:25:21,524 --> 00:25:22,891
Woah, woah, woah. Hold it there.

477
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:24,759
This is a restricted area.

478
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,094
Not for me.

479
00:25:26,095 --> 00:25:27,729
Excuse me?

480
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,300
Are you one of these
rent-a-cop types

481
00:25:31,301 --> 00:25:35,070
who doesn't know who he works for?

482
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:36,972
Mr. Sadler?

483
00:25:36,973 --> 00:25:39,773
Take me to the girl.

484
00:25:39,774 --> 00:25:41,208
Sure.

485
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:42,876
Right this way.

486
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:02,696
I'll talk to Alec.

487
00:26:02,697 --> 00:26:05,198
But there's no way he would
risk Emily's life like this.

488
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:07,867
I expected better, Kiera.

489
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:10,136
So did I.

490
00:26:23,384 --> 00:26:24,683
Here we go.

491
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:26,352
<i>Alec?</i>

492
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:31,523
Hello?

493
00:26:31,524 --> 00:26:32,324
Lucas?

494
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:33,192
<i>Yes?</i>

495
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:33,959
Where's Alec?

496
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,494
I need to speak with him, now.

497
00:26:35,495 --> 00:26:36,828
<i>He stepped out.</i>

498
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:40,199
There's some code written
into the Piron data.

499
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,600
Do you have any idea about it?

500
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,602
<i>What kind of code?</i>

501
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:46,337
Don't bullshit me, Lucas.

502
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,707
<i>You'll have to talk to Alec.</i>

503
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,714
Ok, we're on.

504
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:07,525
Son of a bitch.

505
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,045
Ok, listen to me.

506
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:29,112
<i>Alec's computer links visually to my CMR.</i>

507
00:27:29,113 --> 00:27:30,880
<i>I need you to find it, now!</i>

508
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,018
<i>Hurry, Lucas! Hurry!</i>

509
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,954
Got it.

510
00:27:37,955 --> 00:27:39,022
<i>What am I looking at, Lucas?</i>

511
00:27:39,023 --> 00:27:40,723
The smoke, what is it?

512
00:27:40,724 --> 00:27:41,858
<i>I can't tell.</i>

513
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:43,393
You better figure it out!

514
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:44,761
Ok.

515
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:01,944
It's phosgene.

516
00:28:01,945 --> 00:28:03,179
It's used in chemical warfare.

517
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,646
I'd get out of there right now!

518
00:28:04,647 --> 00:28:05,214
<i>Run!</i>

519
00:28:05,215 --> 00:28:06,382
If I leave, Emily dies!

520
00:28:06,383 --> 00:28:08,117
You're dead if you don't!

521
00:28:08,118 --> 00:28:09,851
<i>It's in his lungs, it's too late!</i>

522
00:28:09,852 --> 00:28:11,809
Come on, we're getting out of here.

523
00:28:16,292 --> 00:28:18,726
<i>I heard about you.</i>

524
00:28:18,727 --> 00:28:20,828
<i>You're tough.</i>

525
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,804
He also told me that you killed-

526
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:40,081
Lucas, I need a solution and I need it now!

527
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:45,686
I think I've got something if you're sure

528
00:28:45,687 --> 00:28:46,988
you want to save him.

529
00:29:04,705 --> 00:29:06,006
<i>Do exactly as I say!</i>

530
00:29:10,845 --> 00:29:12,346
Cameron!

531
00:29:12,347 --> 00:29:14,181
I know what I'm doing!

532
00:29:22,856 --> 00:29:24,290
<i>I'm trying to save him!</i>

533
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:25,791
He's alive.

534
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:27,760
If you want something done right...

535
00:29:42,508 --> 00:29:44,509
<i>Cameron, I am telling you to stop!</i>

536
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,910
Trust me.

537
00:29:47,946 --> 00:29:49,313
<i>Alright, fine.</i>

538
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:51,149
<i>Stand down.</i>

539
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,017
Back away.

540
00:29:53,018 --> 00:29:55,920
I hope you know what you're doing.

541
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:28,004
<i>Now!</i>

542
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:33,909
Help me!

543
00:30:49,525 --> 00:30:50,558
Which door?

544
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,093
She's in there.

545
00:30:52,094 --> 00:30:54,262
Mr. Sadler?

546
00:30:54,263 --> 00:30:56,097
I think I should call Mr. Kellogg.

547
00:30:56,098 --> 00:30:57,231
Apparently this was his-

548
00:30:57,232 --> 00:30:59,067
Is this how you plan to
run the rest of your life?

549
00:30:59,068 --> 00:31:00,601
Waiting for somebody who works for me

550
00:31:00,602 --> 00:31:03,471
to tell you what to do about me?

551
00:31:03,472 --> 00:31:07,108
Have it your way, Mr. Sadler.

552
00:31:08,443 --> 00:31:10,578
Inside with her, now.

553
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:12,881
Move it, let's go!

554
00:32:37,395 --> 00:32:38,262
You came for me!

555
00:32:38,263 --> 00:32:39,263
I did.

556
00:32:39,264 --> 00:32:40,697
Look at my badass boyfriend.

557
00:32:40,698 --> 00:32:42,566
Yeah, look at me.

558
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:43,333
We should go.

559
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:44,368
Yeah.

560
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:53,477
This is far from over.

561
00:33:00,017 --> 00:33:01,417
Is he alive?

562
00:33:07,324 --> 00:33:09,458
Two, three, four.

563
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:19,434
Crazy bitch!

564
00:33:19,435 --> 00:33:21,136
Just breathe, Kellogg.

565
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:22,570
You drowned me!

566
00:33:22,571 --> 00:33:23,738
You were poisoned.

567
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:26,008
I had to fill your lungs
with water to flush it out.

568
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:28,811
In fact, I saved your
life, so now you owe me.

569
00:33:28,812 --> 00:33:30,412
Where is Emily?

570
00:33:30,413 --> 00:33:34,283
You got to kiss me, so we're even.

571
00:33:41,556 --> 00:33:43,590
You don't look so good.

572
00:33:45,627 --> 00:33:46,961
Yeah, look who's talking.

573
00:33:48,997 --> 00:33:51,565
Touché.

574
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:53,334
You saved my life.

575
00:33:55,304 --> 00:33:57,070
Thank you.

576
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:01,708
You don't have a monopoly
on doing the right thing.

577
00:34:08,249 --> 00:34:10,283
Hey, asshole.

578
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:11,584
Nice try.

579
00:34:11,585 --> 00:34:12,919
You missed.

580
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,187
<i>I'll see you again, Kellogg.</i>

581
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:23,062
Our deal, you get the data fixed-

582
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:24,029
<i>Kiera?</i>

583
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,331
I gotta take this.

584
00:34:25,332 --> 00:34:27,666
Sorry.

585
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:29,268
What is it, Lucas?

586
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:30,402
<i>Alec has Emily.</i>

587
00:34:30,403 --> 00:34:32,004
<i>She's safe.</i>

588
00:34:32,005 --> 00:34:32,804
Good.

589
00:34:32,805 --> 00:34:33,739
They're headed home.

590
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,939
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

591
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,241
And Lucas?

592
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:38,109
Yeah?

593
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,677
Thank you.

594
00:34:41,881 --> 00:34:43,714
You're welcome.

595
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:48,586
So?

596
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,221
Oh, nothing.

597
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:51,089
Oh, wait.

598
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,857
Emily escaped.

599
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:55,559
Check and mate.

600
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,597
Knowing her I'm sure there
are a few bodies to clean up.

601
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,866
I gotta go.

602
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:11,542
Yeah, I know.

603
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:15,344
Garza got away in the confusion.

604
00:35:15,345 --> 00:35:19,849
You know she's gonna try to
break him out or something.

605
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,785
Emily is safe.

606
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,987
She's gotta come by the
station and make a report.

607
00:35:24,988 --> 00:35:28,991
I'm sure Kellogg has covered his tracks.

608
00:35:28,992 --> 00:35:33,161
All we need is a link.

609
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:37,966
I'll look into it, Carlos,
but it's been a long day.

610
00:35:57,586 --> 00:35:59,386
Of course.

611
00:35:59,387 --> 00:36:01,522
We follow the truck, we rescue Travis.

612
00:36:03,623 --> 00:36:05,792
We should go once, and if you recall,

613
00:36:05,793 --> 00:36:07,259
it actually worked.

614
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,495
This bullshit today
wasn't about anyone else

615
00:36:09,496 --> 00:36:12,364
but you and Travis trying to
kill Kellogg and apparently me!

616
00:36:12,365 --> 00:36:14,600
Wrong place, wrong time, Cameron.

617
00:36:14,601 --> 00:36:18,270
We're not taking any
chances with that snake.

618
00:36:18,271 --> 00:36:22,240
Besides, we all know you've
been a special interest girl

619
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:24,943
since we landed here.

620
00:36:24,944 --> 00:36:27,946
Is that your version of an apology?

621
00:36:27,947 --> 00:36:30,916
Best you're gonna get.

622
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:34,953
My only special interest
right now is a hot bath.

623
00:36:54,974 --> 00:36:56,607
Oooh, sorry!

624
00:36:56,608 --> 00:36:57,275
Sorry.

625
00:36:57,276 --> 00:36:59,311
It's ok, I don't care.

626
00:36:59,312 --> 00:37:00,445
Jason, I'm already in the tub.

627
00:37:00,446 --> 00:37:01,546
It's ok.

628
00:37:01,547 --> 00:37:02,447
I gotta go.

629
00:37:02,448 --> 00:37:04,649
No.

630
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,616
Wait.

631
00:37:05,617 --> 00:37:07,084
Please.

632
00:37:11,223 --> 00:37:15,993
Is it weird because...

633
00:37:15,994 --> 00:37:18,128
I'm your mother?

634
00:37:20,732 --> 00:37:22,366
Am I your mother?

635
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:24,869
In the future, I mean.

636
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:34,711
Don't catch a cold.

637
00:37:34,712 --> 00:37:37,882
That's what mothers say.

638
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:41,118
But you don't really catch
a cold, it catches you,

639
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,786
doesn't it?

640
00:37:42,787 --> 00:37:47,724
You just stand there, not
trying to chase anything-

641
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:51,428
Is it me?

642
00:37:51,429 --> 00:37:53,062
Is it?

643
00:38:28,398 --> 00:38:29,932
So you're with them now?

644
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,735
Killing Kellogg meant killing Emily.

645
00:38:36,072 --> 00:38:39,374
Travis is in police custody.

646
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:43,511
So if you were with Liber8,

647
00:38:43,512 --> 00:38:47,149
there aren't many of them left.

648
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,883
Thanks for the news flash.

649
00:38:52,188 --> 00:38:53,155
Hey, that uh...

650
00:38:53,156 --> 00:38:55,123
code that you guys wrote
into the Piron data,

651
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:55,991
it's still there.

652
00:38:55,992 --> 00:38:57,659
You wanna do something with that?

653
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,261
What, you mean do I still
want to screw with Kellogg?

654
00:38:59,262 --> 00:39:00,762
I could trigger it right now.

655
00:39:03,365 --> 00:39:04,632
No.

656
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,034
No, I'm not that asshole that goes dark.

657
00:39:07,035 --> 00:39:09,403
I'm not that Alec.

658
00:39:09,404 --> 00:39:11,038
What happened in the last 24 hours

659
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:14,576
was nearly an epic fail.

660
00:39:14,577 --> 00:39:15,643
We're supposed to have the same goal,

661
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:19,914
but I went off on my own
agenda and people nearly-

662
00:39:19,915 --> 00:39:23,884
well, people got hurt.

663
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:26,419
So let's get our heads on straight

664
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,555
and then we can do this.

665
00:39:28,556 --> 00:39:31,257
Do what?

666
00:39:31,258 --> 00:39:33,927
Well, stop Kellogg for starters.

667
00:39:33,928 --> 00:39:35,061
Count me in on that.

668
00:39:35,062 --> 00:39:37,564
We could have stopped Kellogg today.

669
00:39:37,565 --> 00:39:39,867
No, not yet.

670
00:39:39,868 --> 00:39:42,369
He's our only way of
controlling those soldiers.

671
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:45,005
And time travel.

672
00:39:45,006 --> 00:39:46,839
What are you talking about?

673
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,109
Yeah, is someone going somewhere?

674
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:52,044
I'm just saying.

675
00:39:52,045 --> 00:39:54,714
Alec, I'm impressed.

676
00:39:54,715 --> 00:39:56,115
This looks great.

677
00:39:56,116 --> 00:39:57,082
Let's eat.

678
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:57,717
Alright.

679
00:39:57,718 --> 00:39:58,384
<i>Let's eat.</i>

680
00:39:58,385 --> 00:39:59,251
<i>Dig in.</i>

681
00:39:59,252 --> 00:40:00,753
<i>Cheers.</i>

682
00:40:00,754 --> 00:40:02,555
Thank you.

683
00:40:33,052 --> 00:40:36,354
Did you put Liber8 up to killing me?

684
00:40:36,355 --> 00:40:37,956
I don't put anyone up to anything.

685
00:40:37,957 --> 00:40:39,758
I share information.

686
00:40:39,759 --> 00:40:44,228
Everybody's got a goal, hey zombie man?

687
00:40:46,566 --> 00:40:50,969
You couldn't play me, so you played Liber8.

688
00:40:53,706 --> 00:40:55,339
What do you want, Kellogg?

689
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:58,943
I need Garza and Travis
to stop the insanity.

690
00:40:58,944 --> 00:41:00,544
You want to work with them?

691
00:41:00,545 --> 00:41:02,079
No.

692
00:41:04,482 --> 00:41:07,350
You don't know everything.

693
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:09,553
You and that radio
transmitter friend of yours.

694
00:41:09,554 --> 00:41:11,288
Agreed.

695
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:13,090
We all know there's so many paths,

696
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:15,092
with so many outcomes.

697
00:41:15,093 --> 00:41:17,761
A hero on one branch, a villain on another.

698
00:41:17,762 --> 00:41:20,931
But you can't achieve
either all on your own.

699
00:41:24,868 --> 00:41:28,237
So what do you need from me?

700
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:29,839
Very soon you'll have the opportunity

701
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,575
to send Kiera Cameron back to the future.

702
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:33,743
To her home.

703
00:41:38,181 --> 00:41:39,816
What, you mean it's doable?

704
00:41:56,733 --> 00:41:59,835
Anyone who wants to get to
you can do what Kellogg did.

705
00:41:59,836 --> 00:42:03,071
This is the only way you'll be safe.

706
00:42:03,072 --> 00:42:04,940
You're safe.

707
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:05,507
All of us.

708
00:42:05,508 --> 00:42:07,242
We're in this together.

709
00:42:07,243 --> 00:42:08,510
I want to believe that,

710
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,979
but all I have is to go
on is past experience,

711
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,348
and that says something
completely different.

712
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:17,019
You can't keep running

713
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,721
every time something like this happens.

714
00:42:19,722 --> 00:42:24,225
Besides, I'm pretty badass
now, you said so yourself.

715
00:42:24,226 --> 00:42:26,494
You are.

716
00:42:26,495 --> 00:42:28,963
But I'm your Achilles Heel.

717
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:32,800
I'm not badass enough to
keep putting you in danger.

718
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:34,850
Don't ask me to be that person.

719
00:42:37,873 --> 00:42:38,906
I can't let you go.

720
00:42:38,907 --> 00:42:40,241
I'm not giving you a choice.

721
00:42:40,242 --> 00:42:42,009
We have a future, you know that!

722
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:46,381
What I know doesn't change
how I feel about you.

723
00:42:46,382 --> 00:42:48,816
But I have to protect both of us.

724
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:51,285
And this is the only way
I know how to do that.

725
00:43:03,699 --> 00:43:04,899
Emily.

726
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,366
Emily!
