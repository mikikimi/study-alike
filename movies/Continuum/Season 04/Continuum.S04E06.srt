1
00:00:00,279 --> 00:00:02,147
Previously, on Continuum.

2
00:00:02,181 --> 00:00:03,481
We need to work together

3
00:00:03,515 --> 00:00:06,551
because I'm the guy holding
your golden ticket.

4
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:08,085
What happens with you?

5
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,119
You made your choice.

6
00:00:09,154 --> 00:00:10,087
You chose you.

7
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:11,356
I'm reprogramming it.

8
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,357
Will it work?

9
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:14,058
That's the question
I'm afraid to ask myself.

10
00:00:14,092 --> 00:00:16,193
Somewhere in time the traveller
changed something.

11
00:00:16,228 --> 00:00:17,662
His future ceased to exist.

12
00:00:17,696 --> 00:00:18,763
A moment is coming.

13
00:00:18,797 --> 00:00:20,998
A chance to repair everything.

14
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:22,633
Brad's here, I think he's here for the key.

15
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:24,902
Nothing personal, but I've got a deadline.

16
00:00:24,936 --> 00:00:26,036
Give me Kellogg!

17
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:27,004
I'll come for you.

18
00:00:27,038 --> 00:00:28,739
The plan moves ahead.

19
00:00:28,773 --> 00:00:29,939
I promise.

20
00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:33,777
Time's up.

21
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:47,624
Nora gave us approval to hit them hard.

22
00:00:47,658 --> 00:00:48,492
We've got eyes on the building

23
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:50,226
but they haven't made a move.

24
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:51,460
They won't.

25
00:00:51,495 --> 00:00:53,096
They can't.

26
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,397
When's your team going in?

27
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:57,901
Well, we're gearing up now.

28
00:00:57,935 --> 00:00:59,635
I know I can't stop you.

29
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:02,071
I don't want to.

30
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:05,308
But I need to ask one last favour.

31
00:01:05,342 --> 00:01:10,380
Please, give me a head-start
before you launch your assault.

32
00:01:22,158 --> 00:01:23,992
What are you doing?

33
00:01:24,027 --> 00:01:28,363
Making a tsunami.

34
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:30,265
Don't worry about it.

35
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,903
Ok. I won't.

36
00:01:34,938 --> 00:01:37,039
Time to go.

37
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:39,707
That has multiple meanings at this point.

38
00:01:41,877 --> 00:01:43,045
Those officers,

39
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,081
Travis, they died trying to prevent

40
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:50,218
what Kellogg's army is about to do.

41
00:01:50,253 --> 00:01:56,124
The least we can do is finish the job.

42
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,060
You know, even if I figured
out a way to send you

43
00:01:58,094 --> 00:02:00,528
forward in time, I'm still
not entirely sure

44
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:04,031
which future I'll be sending you to.

45
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:05,867
Odds are it'll be
linked to Kellogg's dark future

46
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:07,836
which, if we don't stop him now,

47
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,905
it'll be a very nasty place in 60 years.

48
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,273
But if there's even the slightest chance

49
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:15,910
that I can be with Sam again,

50
00:02:15,945 --> 00:02:18,112
I'm willing to risk everything.

51
00:02:21,216 --> 00:02:22,917
Ok.

52
00:02:22,952 --> 00:02:25,519
Let's go risk everything.

53
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:27,488
I just hope it's not too late.

54
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:42,669
This cost us two good marines.

55
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,938
It cost a lot more than that.

56
00:03:01,588 --> 00:03:03,323
Once we send the pulse
signal to our future and tether,

57
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:04,891
we will be locked.

58
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:06,826
When that happens you only
have 90 minutes to get

59
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,528
everyone through before the
tether degrades completely.

60
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:10,130
Is that gonna be enough?

61
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:13,066
There's only one way to find out.

62
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,433
Do it.

63
00:03:29,149 --> 00:03:32,784
Tether is locked, the clock's running.

64
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:35,020
Open the portal.

65
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:18,260
Turn it off!

66
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:31,340
What the hell happened, Zorin?

67
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:32,508
I don't know,

68
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:33,842
I... what happened?

69
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:35,711
The key's been shorted.

70
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:37,413
Fix it, now.

71
00:04:37,447 --> 00:04:40,082
The tether is holding,
the clock is still running.

72
00:04:40,117 --> 00:04:41,883
Grimes, I'm sorry.

73
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:42,551
Sorry?

74
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:43,719
I just lost good men.

75
00:04:43,753 --> 00:04:45,687
Men you'll miss unless we
get this portal back online.

76
00:04:45,722 --> 00:04:47,089
Where's Marcellus?

77
00:04:47,124 --> 00:04:48,056
He didn't make it.

78
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:49,658
Are you kidding me?

79
00:04:49,692 --> 00:04:51,093
We need to get this portal
open again quickly

80
00:04:51,128 --> 00:04:53,061
or the only thing coming
through will be the enemy.

81
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,115
It's for the best.

82
00:06:11,508 --> 00:06:13,779
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

83
00:06:19,872 --> 00:06:24,208
I guess we're eating in tonight.

84
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:27,578
You know, when I
first came to this timeline,

85
00:06:27,612 --> 00:06:33,317
I thought that having
it all was within my grasp.

86
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:36,487
But when I really thought about it,

87
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:41,759
not having something to fight for...

88
00:06:41,793 --> 00:06:47,998
someone to fight for...

89
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:55,405
well, it all seems just
a little... unsatisfying.

90
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,711
I'm guessing the other me, the future me,

91
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:07,517
he found something or someone
worth fighting for.

92
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,156
Well, based on the shaking
floors and walls,

93
00:07:14,191 --> 00:07:15,992
I'm guessing you fired up your machine.

94
00:07:16,026 --> 00:07:17,560
Yes, we did.

95
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:19,495
So uh... that's it, I guess
we're all done here.

96
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:21,064
Not yet.

97
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:24,200
We're having a small problem
with one of our key components.

98
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:26,703
You wouldn't happen to know if uh...

99
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,205
Cameron or Sadler sabotaged it?

100
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:32,508
I wouldn't put it past them.

101
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:34,376
Hmm.

102
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:38,080
Are you doing alright, sir?

103
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:40,816
Well, you know, while I
certainly appreciate the degree

104
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,586
to which you made efforts to get
me out of the police station,

105
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,323
I just can't help but feel I
moved from one cell to another.

106
00:07:47,357 --> 00:07:49,125
This is for your safety.

107
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:52,694
You mean me, or other me?

108
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:57,333
At this point, what happens
to you happens to him.

109
00:07:57,367 --> 00:07:58,700
Our times are tethered now,

110
00:07:58,735 --> 00:08:00,869
which means any changes in this moment

111
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:03,005
would ripple into our future.

112
00:08:08,244 --> 00:08:10,712
Your safety is paramount.

113
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:13,481
Hey, well I feel better already.

114
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:21,723
So when geriatric me arrives,

115
00:08:21,758 --> 00:08:23,859
what happens to me, me?

116
00:08:23,893 --> 00:08:25,761
What with the whole
kidney failure situation

117
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:29,230
and everything.

118
00:08:29,265 --> 00:08:32,833
You were very specific.

119
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:34,568
Before we left you issued strict protocols

120
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:39,540
regarding how to deal with you.

121
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:41,175
You were to be treated in a manner

122
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:42,342
befitting your importance.

123
00:08:42,377 --> 00:08:44,111
But that's a sliding scale, isn't it?

124
00:08:44,146 --> 00:08:46,113
Important now, liability later.

125
00:08:46,148 --> 00:08:47,247
It's not like that.

126
00:08:47,282 --> 00:08:51,052
Let's say he decides to come here.

127
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:54,288
Our times are linked by
that machine out there.

128
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:56,557
That means no new timeline.

129
00:08:56,591 --> 00:08:59,093
That means a paradox.

130
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:00,660
I have a little experience with paradoxes,

131
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:04,698
I lost my grandmother to one in 2012.

132
00:09:04,732 --> 00:09:08,467
I have no idea what you're talking about.

133
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:12,371
Has anyone ever told you
that you're a terrible liar?

134
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:17,110
You got your head start.

135
00:09:17,144 --> 00:09:18,812
I'll be 30 minutes behind you.

136
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:23,116
Thank you.

137
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,619
You know, as much as you've
screwed up my life and my job

138
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:32,357
and, well, my understanding of everything,

139
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:35,560
I hate to admit it but I
wouldn't change a damn thing.

140
00:09:35,595 --> 00:09:38,597
You reminded me of what's important.

141
00:09:38,631 --> 00:09:42,367
What being a protector really means.

142
00:09:42,401 --> 00:09:44,903
There's a lot to fix
in this time, you know.

143
00:09:44,938 --> 00:09:48,539
You could stay and we could work together.

144
00:09:48,573 --> 00:09:50,441
Guarantee your future never happened.

145
00:09:50,475 --> 00:09:51,976
That's what I'm counting on.

146
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,945
With or without me,

147
00:09:53,979 --> 00:09:56,848
that's exactly what you
and Alec are going to do.

148
00:10:02,955 --> 00:10:05,989
I want to help you,

149
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:08,559
but I also don't want to lose you.

150
00:10:08,593 --> 00:10:11,528
You've always been there for me.

151
00:10:11,563 --> 00:10:13,397
I always will.

152
00:10:13,431 --> 00:10:15,432
I know.

153
00:10:20,372 --> 00:10:22,306
Ok.

154
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,774
Don't make me regret getting all emotional.

155
00:10:23,808 --> 00:10:25,275
Get out of here.

156
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:29,979
You're a good man.

157
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:42,158
You ready?

158
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:42,958
Yeah.

159
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:45,126
What the hell happened in there?

160
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:47,496
I know you and Carlos
are covering for Travis.

161
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,298
I need to know why.

162
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,472
I've wanted to tell you.

163
00:10:57,507 --> 00:11:01,643
Before now.

164
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:04,145
But I think it's better if I show you.

165
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:17,291
I don't understand.

166
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:24,332
Me, Travis, Liber8, Kellogg and his army...

167
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:26,099
we're from the future.

168
00:11:30,305 --> 00:11:33,741
I'm trying to get back to the year 2077.

169
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:37,477
We came here to change history.

170
00:11:37,511 --> 00:11:41,681
To make a better world,

171
00:11:41,716 --> 00:11:46,118
and today it's all on the line.

172
00:11:46,153 --> 00:11:49,188
You're not kidding?

173
00:11:49,223 --> 00:11:51,424
We could use a good man like you.

174
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,677
Can I get you a glass?

175
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,479
No, thank you.

176
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,721
Save it.

177
00:12:22,756 --> 00:12:24,355
Sounds ominous.

178
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,857
I know what you're trying to do.

179
00:12:25,891 --> 00:12:27,324
What am I trying to do?

180
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:29,527
You're trying to talk me
into letting you out of here

181
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:31,696
or giving you information you want.

182
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:35,933
No.

183
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,369
Yeah.

184
00:12:38,404 --> 00:12:43,307
Whatever.

185
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:46,911
But it's bigger than that.

186
00:12:46,945 --> 00:12:48,880
And it involves a certain you.

187
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:50,281
You're wasting your time.

188
00:12:50,315 --> 00:12:55,385
In this case, I think I'm
using what's left of it wisely.

189
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,554
Consider this:

190
00:12:57,588 --> 00:13:03,427
why have an old, sick Kellogg leading you

191
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:08,097
when you can have a young
and vital Kellogg?

192
00:13:08,132 --> 00:13:10,934
Sure, he needs to get up to speed,

193
00:13:10,968 --> 00:13:18,041
but together they can accomplish this.

194
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:23,246
She will always be by his side as his queen

195
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,483
and rule their new empire together.

196
00:13:27,517 --> 00:13:30,519
I see love in there.

197
00:13:30,554 --> 00:13:32,855
You have feelings for me.

198
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:46,836
But we can never be together.

199
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,704
Never.

200
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:09,024
If you had just
listened to me, believed in me,

201
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:10,526
we could have had something.

202
00:14:11,895 --> 00:14:12,528
I could... I could never...

203
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:14,964
Why?

204
00:14:14,998 --> 00:14:17,466
Am I that repulsive?

205
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:21,003
You're... my... my father...

206
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:33,115
Of course I am.

207
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,284
Thank you, Jason.

208
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:45,152
So this is it.

209
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:47,187
This is really it?

210
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:49,322
No second thoughts, no turning back?

211
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:51,591
Jason, you can come with me.

212
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:53,727
You can go home, too.

213
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:55,896
No, it's too much.

214
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,564
It's too late.

215
00:14:57,598 --> 00:14:59,767
I've been here too long.

216
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:02,335
No, this is my home now.

217
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:07,740
I still have some work to do.

218
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,375
Ok.

219
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:15,414
If you manage to make it back to 2077,

220
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,416
give this to my father.

221
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,686
There are some things
I needed to say to him,

222
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:26,457
to you, that I never had
the chance to before I left.

223
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,760
I will.

224
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,196
Alright, it's time.

225
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,699
Let's hope Kellogg holds
up his end of the bargain.

226
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,170
Goodbye, Jason.

227
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:39,738
Bye.

228
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,259
You alright?

229
00:16:03,293 --> 00:16:05,195
Where is he?

230
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:06,662
He's close.

231
00:16:06,697 --> 00:16:08,431
How's our arrangement looking?

232
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:12,235
She'll show, I know it.

233
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:13,903
My demands.

234
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,814
Let's go.

235
00:16:33,823 --> 00:16:35,124
This better be you, Kellogg.

236
00:16:35,158 --> 00:16:36,492
Game on, protector.

237
00:16:36,526 --> 00:16:38,661
Head for the north-east door.

238
00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:40,663
You need to move quickly.

239
00:16:44,268 --> 00:16:45,668
How are we doing on that key?

240
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:46,869
Getting there.

241
00:16:46,903 --> 00:16:49,671
Every minute costs us lives.

242
00:16:49,705 --> 00:16:50,739
Did Marcellus know?

243
00:16:50,773 --> 00:16:52,006
Did Marcellus know what?

244
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,175
That this was an invasion?

245
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:55,343
What are you talking about?

246
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:56,344
Oh, come on.

247
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:57,512
Just tell me.

248
00:16:57,546 --> 00:16:58,780
I want to know if he lied to me

249
00:16:58,814 --> 00:17:02,183
or if you kept him in the dark, too.

250
00:17:02,217 --> 00:17:03,652
Alright.

251
00:17:03,686 --> 00:17:06,888
I suppose it doesn't make a difference now.

252
00:17:06,922 --> 00:17:09,690
Yeah, Marcellus knew.

253
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:11,592
It was his idea to convince you otherwise.

254
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:14,528
He knew the first minute
we arrived you went soft.

255
00:17:14,562 --> 00:17:16,897
I betrayed people thinking
this was the only way

256
00:17:16,931 --> 00:17:18,231
to save families!

257
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:20,734
Nothing's changed, Tonkin.

258
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:23,671
We're still saving families.

259
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:25,572
Ours.

260
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,514
Kiera?

261
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:36,716
Yeah?

262
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,285
You saved me.

263
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,721
What are you talking about?

264
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:45,692
We all go through life thinking
we know how it's gonna turn out.

265
00:17:45,726 --> 00:17:48,194
We imagine our future, we
make moves and decisions

266
00:17:48,228 --> 00:17:51,129
that lead us in that direction.

267
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:53,532
But you changed that for me.

268
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:56,568
You gave me knowledge of what would be.

269
00:17:56,602 --> 00:17:58,203
The life that I was supposed to have,

270
00:17:58,237 --> 00:18:02,374
the future that I built that you came from.

271
00:18:02,408 --> 00:18:06,678
A profound regret is what you spared me.

272
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:09,180
I don't think I'll ever
be able to thank you enough.

273
00:18:09,215 --> 00:18:10,849
Alec.

274
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:14,385
The simple fact that you want to change

275
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:17,788
is all the thanks I will ever need.

276
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:21,124
I won't let you down.

277
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:23,060
I know.

278
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:27,565
We don't have much time.

279
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,599
Go.

280
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,470
Zorin says they're close
to opening the portal.

281
00:18:33,504 --> 00:18:35,705
And you should know they brought
through reinforcements.

282
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,473
How many?

283
00:18:36,507 --> 00:18:37,741
Three.

284
00:18:37,775 --> 00:18:40,142
Carlos and the VPD will be
hitting this place any minute.

285
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:41,578
Your security team needs to do its thing

286
00:18:41,612 --> 00:18:43,713
and draw the soldiers
into a two-front fight.

287
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:44,447
Zach.

288
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:45,448
I'll prepare them.

289
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:46,315
I'm a man of my word.

290
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,251
Not really.

291
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:49,386
Alec, what do you need?

292
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,453
Access to the machine.

293
00:18:50,488 --> 00:18:51,888
I'll need at least 30 seconds at the panel,

294
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,890
assuming it's straightforward.

295
00:18:56,493 --> 00:18:59,762
You know I've always been
an admirer of yours.

296
00:18:59,796 --> 00:19:02,598
Women like you are rare in any time.

297
00:19:02,632 --> 00:19:04,967
Past, present, or future.

298
00:19:05,002 --> 00:19:07,603
Whatever happens in there,

299
00:19:07,637 --> 00:19:10,773
I'll always know I met my
match in Kiera Cameron.

300
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:14,443
Well, thank you.

301
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:17,346
Don't-don't you have anything
nice you wanna say about me?

302
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,348
Not really.

303
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:23,485
I'm going to go to the portal
room, do some recon.

304
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,019
You stay here.

305
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:25,487
I'll be back.

306
00:19:35,164 --> 00:19:36,131
Let's get somebody on the north and south,

307
00:19:36,165 --> 00:19:38,099
we'll need eyes on this entrance as well.

308
00:19:38,134 --> 00:19:44,305
Get eyes over here, let me
know if you see any movement.

309
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:45,606
We arrested him trying to
get through our perimeter,

310
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:46,574
says he knows you?

311
00:19:46,608 --> 00:19:48,042
Yeah, it's all good, Cuttlemans.

312
00:19:48,076 --> 00:19:49,043
What're you doing here?

313
00:19:49,077 --> 00:19:49,977
Warning you.

314
00:19:50,011 --> 00:19:51,078
I wanted to warn you.

315
00:19:51,112 --> 00:19:52,379
Kiera, Alec...

316
00:19:52,414 --> 00:19:54,549
Those two of ours are inside.

317
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,249
I'll brief the squad.

318
00:19:55,283 --> 00:19:56,884
But there's something else.

319
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:58,118
The machine in there

320
00:19:58,153 --> 00:20:01,354
is essentially an anti-matter fusion bomb.

321
00:20:01,388 --> 00:20:02,722
Once those guns start firing,

322
00:20:02,757 --> 00:20:06,125
you could set off a chain
reaction explosion.

323
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,627
What kind of damage are we talking about?

324
00:20:07,662 --> 00:20:12,766
Worst case scenario... half the city.

325
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,437
Ironic.

326
00:20:17,472 --> 00:20:18,638
What's that?

327
00:20:18,673 --> 00:20:20,506
This is near where you killed
Lucas in cold blood.

328
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,774
That was different.

329
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:23,609
I don't see how.

330
00:20:23,643 --> 00:20:26,211
You made your choice, now you live with it.

331
00:20:26,245 --> 00:20:27,513
It's not always black and white, Kiera.

332
00:20:27,547 --> 00:20:29,014
You of all people should know that.

333
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:30,516
Oh, that's right.

334
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,018
You're either fighting for
an idea that's bigger than you,

335
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:35,320
or you're fighting for yourself.

336
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:37,322
Which is it?

337
00:20:37,357 --> 00:20:39,692
I'm not sure.

338
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:41,694
I am.

339
00:20:41,728 --> 00:20:44,029
You're conflicted, Brad.

340
00:20:44,063 --> 00:20:45,764
You want clarity,

341
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:48,233
and clarity is a luxury in this business.

342
00:20:48,267 --> 00:20:49,767
Time travel screws with our notions

343
00:20:49,802 --> 00:20:52,170
about what's supposed to happen.

344
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:54,806
It gives us a false sense of control,

345
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,711
but really, we're all just pawns.

346
00:20:59,745 --> 00:21:03,415
And all this?

347
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:06,184
This is to keep the darkness at bay.

348
00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:10,355
And you of all people
should understand that.

349
00:21:19,564 --> 00:21:23,200
Marcellus lied to me.

350
00:21:23,235 --> 00:21:24,502
He told me we were building a portal

351
00:21:24,536 --> 00:21:27,438
to rescue our brothers and sisters

352
00:21:27,472 --> 00:21:30,941
from an oncoming massacre,

353
00:21:30,975 --> 00:21:33,210
but it's a full-scale invasion.

354
00:21:33,245 --> 00:21:35,579
They want to bring the war
to this time and win it

355
00:21:35,613 --> 00:21:37,281
before it even starts.

356
00:21:37,315 --> 00:21:38,815
Audacious.

357
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,185
This whole thing is insane.

358
00:21:41,219 --> 00:21:43,720
So what do you want to do about it?

359
00:21:48,726 --> 00:21:50,761
I want to prevent more suffering.

360
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:58,035
Brad's right.

361
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:01,572
Mission priority:

362
00:22:01,606 --> 00:22:04,575
destroy the machine and the portal.

363
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:05,576
What?

364
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,677
What about you?

365
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:11,047
If it's my time, we'll find
out one way or another.

366
00:22:11,082 --> 00:22:12,915
But either way,

367
00:22:17,788 --> 00:22:19,489
change of plans.

368
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:28,393
Carlos?

369
00:22:28,427 --> 00:22:29,727
What are we looking at?

370
00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:31,996
Piron security's gonna let us in.

371
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,230
The north west door.

372
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:34,231
My guys will go through the machine room

373
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:36,534
and hit them from the other side.

374
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:38,536
Copy, north west door.

375
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,270
Hey, Kiera,

376
00:22:40,304 --> 00:22:41,905
do we trust Kellogg?

377
00:22:45,376 --> 00:22:48,144
I'm not sure.

378
00:22:48,178 --> 00:22:50,046
Good luck, Carlos.

379
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,183
Well, that's my cue.

380
00:22:54,218 --> 00:22:56,152
I like to leave before the shooting starts,

381
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:59,689
as you know.

382
00:22:59,724 --> 00:23:01,491
Goodbye, Kiera.

383
00:23:01,526 --> 00:23:03,359
It's been...

384
00:23:03,394 --> 00:23:07,496
well... never mind.

385
00:23:18,408 --> 00:23:19,842
Sir...

386
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:21,944
I'm here to offer my services,

387
00:23:21,978 --> 00:23:24,547
limited as they are.

388
00:23:24,581 --> 00:23:27,349
Bradley, let me see your firearm please.

389
00:23:30,853 --> 00:23:32,587
We can use every cop we can get.

390
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:36,491
Gentlemen.

391
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,282
So how long have you known about Kiera?

392
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:03,250
Long enough.

393
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:05,520
Probably should have told you sooner.

394
00:24:05,554 --> 00:24:08,490
The old me would have screwed it up.

395
00:24:08,524 --> 00:24:10,324
I wasn't ready to listen.

396
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:54,800
Where the hell have you been?

397
00:24:54,835 --> 00:24:56,903
Vasquez is dead.

398
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:00,372
What?

399
00:25:02,743 --> 00:25:03,576
And Kellogg?

400
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,243
I don't know.

401
00:25:04,277 --> 00:25:06,478
He's not where he should be.

402
00:25:06,513 --> 00:25:08,881
If something happens to him,
this was all for nothing.

403
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:10,550
Yeah, I know.

404
00:25:13,353 --> 00:25:16,255
Grimes, get your people ready.

405
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:17,623
Somebody find Kellogg.

406
00:25:17,658 --> 00:25:19,058
I'm on it.

407
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:37,609
We can't open the portal
without all of them.

408
00:25:37,643 --> 00:25:39,211
I know.

409
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:40,779
We need to buy ourselves some time.

410
00:25:40,813 --> 00:25:43,013
You know what to do.

411
00:25:46,318 --> 00:25:48,086
What are they up to?

412
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,253
I don't know,

413
00:25:49,288 --> 00:25:51,456
but I don't like the looks of it.

414
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,126
Ok, there's Carlos.

415
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,234
Remember, do not hit the machine.

416
00:26:11,876 --> 00:26:13,711
Where are your men?

417
00:26:13,745 --> 00:26:15,378
There.

418
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:20,818
Alright.

419
00:26:20,852 --> 00:26:22,786
Here we go.

420
00:26:34,297 --> 00:26:35,932
We have contact!

421
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:38,534
Oh, shit.

422
00:26:39,402 --> 00:26:40,469
This is VPD!

423
00:26:40,504 --> 00:26:42,038
Put your weapons down and lay face down

424
00:26:42,072 --> 00:26:43,405
with your hands on the floor!

425
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,641
Now!

426
00:26:44,675 --> 00:26:46,042
Weaver?

427
00:26:56,386 --> 00:26:58,020
Oh, no.

428
00:27:02,091 --> 00:27:03,192
What the...?

429
00:27:03,993 --> 00:27:05,161
NOW!!!!!

430
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,496
Take cover!

431
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,336
The Piron guards aren't shooting.

432
00:27:14,371 --> 00:27:14,970
I know!

433
00:27:15,004 --> 00:27:16,671
I don't get it.

434
00:27:16,705 --> 00:27:18,173
Why aren't your men firing?

435
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:19,106
Orders, sir.

436
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:20,141
Who's orders?

437
00:27:20,176 --> 00:27:21,409
Mr. Kellogg's orders.

438
00:27:23,111 --> 00:27:24,979
We need to bring in the others.

439
00:27:25,013 --> 00:27:26,481
Tether's holding.

440
00:27:26,515 --> 00:27:27,549
But even if I can fix the key,

441
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:29,484
we need that power canister.

442
00:27:34,122 --> 00:27:35,290
No!

443
00:27:43,364 --> 00:27:44,131
Kellogg!

444
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:45,132
You were right.

445
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:46,734
Predictable to a fault.

446
00:27:50,138 --> 00:27:50,871
I got eyes on Kellogg!

447
00:27:50,906 --> 00:27:52,039
How do I get to his position?

448
00:27:52,074 --> 00:27:53,373
Not on the blueprints that I have!

449
00:27:53,408 --> 00:27:55,375
There's a utility corridor
that runs underneath

450
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,977
the south wall.

451
00:27:57,012 --> 00:27:58,579
Follow me.

452
00:27:59,915 --> 00:28:02,016
Bradley, hold this position
as long as you can.

453
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,684
Let's go!

454
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:05,452
Back up, back up!

455
00:28:07,322 --> 00:28:08,589
We gotta go, now!

456
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:15,762
Back up, Kellogg.

457
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:17,063
What are you doing?

458
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,667
What do you think you're doing, Cameron?

459
00:28:20,702 --> 00:28:22,436
I think you don't want anything to happen

460
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,072
to your supreme leader that
might ripple into the future.

461
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:37,083
Get out of my way, Curtis.

462
00:28:37,118 --> 00:28:39,052
Someone's gotta put a stop to this.

463
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:40,453
You've never wavered, Jasmine.

464
00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:42,455
Never stopped fighting for the cause.

465
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:43,857
You're so focused you haven't noticed

466
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:46,359
that you're already victorious.

467
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:48,228
That might be so,

468
00:28:48,262 --> 00:28:49,462
but I'm not going to let you

469
00:28:49,496 --> 00:28:52,665
or anyone else risk the lives
of everyone in this timeline

470
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:54,901
so that Kellogg can screw us all over.

471
00:28:54,935 --> 00:28:56,836
Kellogg has his own path that he must take.

472
00:28:56,871 --> 00:28:58,905
Neither you nor I can change that.

473
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:01,407
I don't remember being your
hostage as part of our deal.

474
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:02,541
And I don't recall you mentioning

475
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:05,244
your plan to time travel using the portal.

476
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:07,913
What?

477
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:09,014
Now why would he do that?

478
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:10,949
Because he knows he's screwed.

479
00:29:10,984 --> 00:29:14,452
In this time, and in
the one that you come from.

480
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:15,954
He's got nowhere to go but backwards.

481
00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:19,124
You have been playing
both sides since the beginning.

482
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:19,758
That's right.

483
00:29:19,793 --> 00:29:21,126
So why should I trust you?

484
00:29:21,161 --> 00:29:22,961
Because I think you want
what's best for the protector

485
00:29:22,996 --> 00:29:24,629
as much as I do.

486
00:29:24,664 --> 00:29:26,731
She left 2077 against her own will

487
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,700
and she's done more to change
the future than Liber8

488
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,702
could have ever done.

489
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:34,239
At the end of the day
she is our best weapon.

490
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:34,907
Backwards?

491
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,175
What are you talking about?

492
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:40,378
You wait under that bridge for
all of us to arrive from 2077

493
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:42,246
and then you kill everyone.

494
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,013
You're insane.

495
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,014
No.

496
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:46,083
Because then you
start out with a clean slate

497
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,518
and influence a young man in a barn.

498
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:59,296
Well, now we can get down to business.

499
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:05,443
You, fix the key.

500
00:30:05,477 --> 00:30:07,212
Now.

501
00:30:07,246 --> 00:30:09,114
I'll kill him, right now.

502
00:30:09,148 --> 00:30:10,748
Will you?

503
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:12,749
'Cause I don't think you will.

504
00:30:12,784 --> 00:30:17,788
I think you need that portal
open just as much as I do.

505
00:30:17,822 --> 00:30:21,458
I think you could have raided
this place days ago,

506
00:30:21,492 --> 00:30:23,593
but you didn't.

507
00:30:23,628 --> 00:30:26,297
You needed us to fix that machine.

508
00:30:26,331 --> 00:30:28,765
You sabotaged that key to stall us.

509
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,102
Why?

510
00:30:32,137 --> 00:30:36,974
So you could use the portal for yourself.

511
00:30:47,718 --> 00:30:49,152
Get down, get down!

512
00:31:00,998 --> 00:31:02,165
Give him the key.

513
00:31:07,237 --> 00:31:10,139
Take it.

514
00:31:10,174 --> 00:31:12,208
Fix it.

515
00:31:25,856 --> 00:31:27,523
Weaver?

516
00:31:29,993 --> 00:31:30,959
Move to the lower level.

517
00:31:30,994 --> 00:31:32,461
Let's move!

518
00:31:59,555 --> 00:32:00,287
Fix it.

519
00:32:00,322 --> 00:32:01,288
I'm trying.

520
00:32:01,323 --> 00:32:02,189
Faster.

521
00:32:02,224 --> 00:32:03,391
I'm trying!

522
00:32:03,425 --> 00:32:05,092
The clock's ticking.

523
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,434
What is he doing?

524
00:32:13,468 --> 00:32:15,368
He's bringing his army.

525
00:32:15,403 --> 00:32:16,469
Done.

526
00:32:18,673 --> 00:32:20,574
Thank you.

527
00:32:20,608 --> 00:32:22,175
We have to stop them!

528
00:32:27,015 --> 00:32:28,815
Weaver, take the kid.

529
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:32,285
This invasion starts now.

530
00:32:38,092 --> 00:32:39,059
Carlos!

531
00:32:44,365 --> 00:32:44,897
Gun!

532
00:32:44,932 --> 00:32:46,699
Gun!

533
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:48,000
Kill everyone!

534
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:32,343
Weaver!

535
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:19,288
Dillon!

536
00:34:22,725 --> 00:34:24,126
I choose me!

537
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:25,294
Kellogg, no!

538
00:34:36,806 --> 00:34:38,407
No!

539
00:34:53,723 --> 00:34:56,158
Kiera, the portal is collapsing.

540
00:34:56,192 --> 00:34:58,126
Kellogg destroyed that future
when he went through.

541
00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:00,162
You're gonna be ok, we're
gonna get you out of here, Jack.

542
00:35:00,196 --> 00:35:02,463
It's now or never.

543
00:35:02,498 --> 00:35:04,131
Listen to the kid.

544
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:05,766
Kiera?

545
00:35:05,801 --> 00:35:07,735
Kiera, please!

546
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:09,270
No.

547
00:35:15,177 --> 00:35:17,512
Kiera, please!

548
00:35:27,455 --> 00:35:29,156
You don't have to say anything.

549
00:35:29,191 --> 00:35:32,292
I know.

550
00:35:32,327 --> 00:35:34,294
I'll build you a better future.

551
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:37,297
I'll do it for you, Kiera Cameron.

552
00:35:37,332 --> 00:35:39,834
Thank you.

553
00:35:50,478 --> 00:35:51,978
Thank you.

554
00:36:07,527 --> 00:36:08,661
We gotta clear out of here.

555
00:36:08,695 --> 00:36:10,764
Everyone, fall back!

556
00:36:10,798 --> 00:36:12,331
Fall back!

557
00:36:23,885 --> 00:36:26,520
It's a shame to lose Dillon
and all those officers.

558
00:36:26,555 --> 00:36:29,156
For what?

559
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,691
Is Kiera dead?

560
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:35,930
Alec?

561
00:36:35,964 --> 00:36:39,066
She might not be.

562
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,568
The machine was tethered to my future.

563
00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:44,271
The future that was destroyed
the moment Kellogg went through,

564
00:36:44,305 --> 00:36:47,574
allowing the traveller to
return to his own time.

565
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:50,743
What the hell happened to Kiera?

566
00:36:50,778 --> 00:36:52,645
There's no way to know.

567
00:36:54,248 --> 00:36:58,651
It might be another 60 years
before we figure it out.

568
00:36:58,686 --> 00:37:01,788
Look, what we do with this is up to us.

569
00:37:01,822 --> 00:37:04,090
All of us.

570
00:37:04,124 --> 00:37:06,359
We have a chance to build something better.

571
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:07,727
For her.

572
00:37:07,761 --> 00:37:09,462
No, except we're screwed.

573
00:37:09,497 --> 00:37:12,264
Kellogg stepped through.

574
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:13,232
Kiera had the notion

575
00:37:13,266 --> 00:37:16,402
that Kellogg would try something like this.

576
00:37:16,436 --> 00:37:19,639
We used Piron's equipment
to program Kiera's time ball.

577
00:37:19,673 --> 00:37:21,440
By allowing us to
have access to his system,

578
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:24,977
Kellogg thought he could learn
how to program his time ball,

579
00:37:25,012 --> 00:37:26,145
but instead it just allowed us

580
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:27,513
to feed him the wrong information

581
00:37:27,547 --> 00:37:29,515
regarding how to select dates,

582
00:37:29,549 --> 00:37:32,551
which apparently he assumed was genuine.

583
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:34,286
He might have thought he was
going back to the day that

584
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:36,322
Kiera and Liber8 arrived.

585
00:37:36,356 --> 00:37:37,756
But he didn't.

586
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,992
No.

587
00:37:40,027 --> 00:37:43,829
So where... when did he go?

588
00:38:02,048 --> 00:38:03,381
Oh my god.

589
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:15,527
Oh, that little shit.

590
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,444
No.

591
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,681
No.

592
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:37,915
No!

593
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:42,152
What does this mean?

594
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:46,523
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

595
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:48,693
Liber8 won.

596
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:51,295
What's Liber8?

597
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,664
No, wait.

598
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:57,067
I remember the stories now.

599
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:00,369
Uncle Julian used to
tell me about his younger days

600
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:03,539
protesting the old corporations.

601
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:08,478
A barbaric and
uncivilized age by all accounts.

602
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:12,381
But you would know that, wouldn't you?

603
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,751
You would have known him then.

604
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:21,324
Kiera?

605
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:22,825
I missed it!

606
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:25,961
I didn't want to miss it!

607
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:28,030
I warned you, Alec.

608
00:39:28,064 --> 00:39:33,201
I warned you, but as usual
you don't listen.

609
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,172
It worked.

610
00:39:37,206 --> 00:39:39,274
I've been waiting for you, Kiera.

611
00:39:39,308 --> 00:39:42,044
For 60 years I didn't know
if you died that day

612
00:39:42,078 --> 00:39:44,546
in the portal.

613
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,349
That's right, it's me.

614
00:39:47,383 --> 00:39:50,785
The same one you left just a second ago,

615
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:53,087
from your perspective.

616
00:39:53,122 --> 00:39:55,322
Alec?

617
00:39:55,357 --> 00:40:00,194
Oh, Alec!

618
00:40:00,228 --> 00:40:07,068
I know, you were just with me!

619
00:40:07,102 --> 00:40:09,003
This is so strange.

620
00:40:09,038 --> 00:40:11,605
Imagine what it's like for me.

621
00:40:16,211 --> 00:40:18,111
You did it.

622
00:40:18,146 --> 00:40:20,347
You did it.

623
00:40:21,783 --> 00:40:24,218
Sam?

624
00:40:24,252 --> 00:40:28,222
Is he here?

625
00:40:28,256 --> 00:40:30,658
I'll take you to him.

626
00:40:35,863 --> 00:40:38,932
Emily lobbied City Hall
for that before she passed.

627
00:40:38,966 --> 00:40:40,200
You were together?

628
00:40:40,234 --> 00:40:43,336
Every day until the end.

629
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:46,106
Police?

630
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,175
Not CPS?

631
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:50,510
CPS never formed.

632
00:40:50,544 --> 00:40:54,647
There was no collapse,
no uprising, no revolution.

633
00:40:54,682 --> 00:40:56,149
No corporate congress.

634
00:40:56,184 --> 00:40:59,952
And no corporate congress.

635
00:40:59,986 --> 00:41:02,688
Julian and Edward and I saw to that.

636
00:41:02,723 --> 00:41:05,024
Amazing.

637
00:41:05,058 --> 00:41:06,992
It's because of you, Kiera.

638
00:41:08,895 --> 00:41:10,863
And Sam?

639
00:41:10,897 --> 00:41:12,098
Over there.

640
00:41:16,203 --> 00:41:17,203
Sam.

641
00:41:17,237 --> 00:41:17,869
I set the time coordinates
as close as I could

642
00:41:17,903 --> 00:41:20,639
to the year you left.

643
00:41:20,673 --> 00:41:25,544
I knew you'd have some adjustments to make.

644
00:41:25,578 --> 00:41:28,580
You're not angry?

645
00:41:28,615 --> 00:41:31,617
No, how could I be?

646
00:41:31,651 --> 00:41:34,819
You've given me the greatest gift.

647
00:41:34,854 --> 00:41:37,187
I have to see him.

648
00:41:39,858 --> 00:41:42,159
You made a better world, Kiera.

649
00:41:42,193 --> 00:41:43,661
What?

650
00:41:43,695 --> 00:41:46,264
We thought you died that day.

651
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:48,065
Carlos, Julian and I dedicated ourselves

652
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:51,902
to building a better future.

653
00:41:51,936 --> 00:41:56,707
And we steered civilization
inspired by your sacrifice.

654
00:41:56,742 --> 00:41:59,743
But Sam?

655
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:04,181
This is the price for making
the world a better place.

656
00:42:04,215 --> 00:42:09,386
This Sam will grow up in
a world free of violence,

657
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:13,190
free of revolution, free of corruption.

658
00:42:13,224 --> 00:42:16,593
His future is bright.

659
00:42:16,627 --> 00:42:21,063
And it's because of you, Kiera.

660
00:42:21,098 --> 00:42:24,133
That's the price of love.

661
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:28,004
Real love.

662
00:42:28,038 --> 00:42:32,541
You'll understand in time.
