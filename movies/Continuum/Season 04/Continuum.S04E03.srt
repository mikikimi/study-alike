1
00:00:41,283 --> 00:00:43,950
You know, I think back to before all this,

2
00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:47,521
before you,

3
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:51,525
and I don't ever see
it going back to normal.

4
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:55,929
Now, is that a good thing?

5
00:00:55,963 --> 00:00:57,398
I don't know.

6
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,665
All I know is what I see in front of me,

7
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,167
and everything looks worse.

8
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:04,303
Is that what you had planned in the end?

9
00:01:04,337 --> 00:01:07,239
Who says this is the end?

10
00:01:07,274 --> 00:01:09,241
Look around you, Travis.

11
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:10,676
Liber8 failed.

12
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:13,379
Failed?

13
00:01:13,414 --> 00:01:16,648
Liber8 was sent back to be vaccine.

14
00:01:16,682 --> 00:01:18,383
An injection of sickness

15
00:01:18,418 --> 00:01:20,619
to stimulate society's immune system.

16
00:01:24,156 --> 00:01:27,025
Even the protector believes, now.

17
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:28,460
That's only half true.

18
00:01:28,494 --> 00:01:33,063
What's true is you're going
to be releasing me very soon.

19
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:33,931
Oh yeah?

20
00:01:33,932 --> 00:01:35,098
Why is that?

21
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:39,403
Knowledge is power.

22
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:41,639
I do have an idea.

23
00:01:41,673 --> 00:01:44,675
One that will help with
our future soldier problem.

24
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:46,209
What kind of idea?

25
00:01:46,244 --> 00:01:48,446
Release Travis into my custody.

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,180
Oh, is that all?

27
00:01:51,214 --> 00:01:52,882
Fair enough.

28
00:01:52,883 --> 00:01:54,216
I know it sounds crazy.

29
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:55,251
You could say that.

30
00:01:55,252 --> 00:01:56,653
I'm enjoying this.

31
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:59,288
Shut up.

32
00:01:59,323 --> 00:02:02,158
You want me to deal
with Kellogg's soldiers.

33
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:05,227
That means I need soldiers of my own.

34
00:02:05,262 --> 00:02:07,729
Travis is our best weapon in this fight,

35
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:09,164
you and I both know it.

36
00:02:09,165 --> 00:02:10,231
No.

37
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:11,199
In case you haven't noticed,

38
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,734
we are in a police department, ok?

39
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:14,436
There's an entire force on call

40
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:15,871
to help bring down the bad guys.

41
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:17,906
Not bad guys like this.

42
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:19,875
They are organized, they are well-trained,

43
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:24,278
and they have access to weaponry
even I have never encountered.

44
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:25,880
With Brad on the inside and Travis's help,

45
00:02:25,914 --> 00:02:27,748
we can do things the police can't do.

46
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:29,249
How's that working out for you?

47
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:31,619
Your inside man?

48
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:33,454
Where is he right now?

49
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:35,690
Why hasn't he told you where they are?

50
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:36,791
I trust him.

51
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:38,526
That's the problem right there.

52
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,061
You trust him more than you trust me.

53
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,763
Instead of believing in me

54
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:46,199
you're putting faith
in a man you hardly know

55
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,534
who's a little too cozy with the enemy

56
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:48,935
if you ask me.

57
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:01,146
I hate to say it,

58
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,616
but the man has a point.

59
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,251
Without that key it doesn't matter

60
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,554
if we're ahead of schedule or behind.

61
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,322
If Tonkin can't get it,

62
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,991
what benefit is it to the mission?

63
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,026
I'm right here, Zorin.

64
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,694
Are you?

65
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,897
'Cause I don't see you engaged, Tonkin.

66
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:20,732
I see an opportunist.

67
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:21,866
Someone who's soft.

68
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:24,602
Someone who's a little
confused about his loyalties.

69
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,905
If Tonkin wanted to give us up

70
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,272
we'd be drowning in our own blood.

71
00:03:28,273 --> 00:03:30,642
Every second we're not
means he's doing his job.

72
00:03:30,676 --> 00:03:33,143
You swing at one of my
men again, I'll kill you.

73
00:03:50,027 --> 00:03:51,427
I'm gonna have to ask you to-

74
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:03,606
Ok, ok.

75
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:04,974
Look, whatever they're
paying you, I'll triple it.

76
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:06,407
You can't buy me.

77
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:09,377
You already have.

78
00:04:09,378 --> 00:04:10,545
Who sent you?

79
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:12,313
You did.

80
00:04:12,347 --> 00:04:14,115
Via Marcellus.

81
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:15,951
You think you're untouchable, you're not.

82
00:04:15,985 --> 00:04:19,153
I'm here to change that.

83
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:21,723
You could have just introduced yourself.

84
00:04:24,092 --> 00:04:27,327
Didn't I?

85
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:59,160
<b>synced and corrected by Caio
www.addic7ed.com</b>

86
00:05:13,989 --> 00:05:16,057
Shaboof!

87
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:17,692
I don't care if it's popular in 2077,

88
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:20,261
please never "shaboof" as a taunt or dis

89
00:05:20,263 --> 00:05:21,663
or catchphrase ever again.

90
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:23,230
Don't take out your break-up angst on me,

91
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:24,732
I was trying to distract you.

92
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:26,600
He's right, you gotta get over it.

93
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:27,501
Let's go again.

94
00:05:27,502 --> 00:05:28,436
I'll pass.

95
00:05:28,437 --> 00:05:30,270
I'm through being humiliated for one day.

96
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:31,305
I don't know, man.

97
00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:32,139
Pace yourself.

98
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,441
After Kellogg took away your legacy,

99
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:37,745
you've got a lifetime of
humiliation ahead of you.

100
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:39,746
I seem to recall Kellogg
playing you like a marionette

101
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,414
then tossing you aside like everything else

102
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:42,449
he's done with.

103
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,951
Yeah, but I'm supposed to be his enemy.

104
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:47,386
You, you were actually supposed to be him.

105
00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:49,322
The way I see it, he did you a favour.

106
00:05:49,323 --> 00:05:50,389
How's that?

107
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,626
You wanted to change
your destiny, right Alec?

108
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:54,527
He changed it for you.

109
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:55,161
You dodged a bullet.

110
00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:56,095
Me?

111
00:05:56,096 --> 00:05:57,496
I'm still here, destined to be the bad guy.

112
00:05:57,497 --> 00:05:59,631
Says who?

113
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,733
Bad guy is a matter of perspective.

114
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:04,670
Yeah, well based on my pending body counts

115
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:07,473
I think it's safe to say
sainthood isn't in my future.

116
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:10,809
You both sound like a couple of babies.

117
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:13,945
Here's a tip: take action.

118
00:06:13,946 --> 00:06:15,346
Man up.

119
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:16,848
You're the author of your own destiny.

120
00:06:16,882 --> 00:06:18,415
Act like it.

121
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:23,621
What is that?

122
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:27,525
The beginning of Theseus's great manifesto.

123
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,794
Apparently.

124
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:33,530
I remember reading that for
the first time when I was 14.

125
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:36,165
I'm literally watching
history being written.

126
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,433
I hate to burst your bubble, Lucas,

127
00:06:37,434 --> 00:06:39,435
but I refuse to be the
monster everyone talks about.

128
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,270
No, no, no!

129
00:06:41,305 --> 00:06:44,608
This was a legacy better
left unrealized, I think.

130
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:45,909
As simple as that?

131
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,579
Probably not, no.

132
00:06:50,614 --> 00:06:53,348
I can't help but think the
future will be better off.

133
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:13,701
Hello again.

134
00:07:13,702 --> 00:07:15,102
Move.

135
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:17,405
I think you should make me.

136
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,708
I wouldn't dream of starting
this meeting without you.

137
00:07:20,743 --> 00:07:23,276
Visitors wait over there.

138
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,512
Don't worry, this won't take long.

139
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,956
Kidnapping and unlawful confinement?

140
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,625
That's a serious accusation.

141
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,826
You better arrest me.

142
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,963
You'd be in cuffs right now
if I wanted to arrest you.

143
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,632
Oh, so this is just
some sort of power trip?

144
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,167
Something to fill your time?

145
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,201
No.

146
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,570
He knows that your
lawyers would have you out

147
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,337
in less than an hour.

148
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,505
He just wants you to know he's here

149
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,641
and he's got you in his sights.

150
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,376
You taught me well.

151
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,378
We can go.

152
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:04,248
Ok.

153
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:06,885
Sit down.

154
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:07,986
Or what?

155
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,387
Detention.

156
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,723
I think throwing you downstairs with Travis

157
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:15,492
until your lawyers spring
you would be all kinds of fun.

158
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:17,928
Well, for Travis, that is.

159
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:25,603
Are you sure you want to play this game?

160
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:27,938
See, that's the difference
between you and I, Kellogg.

161
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:30,239
You actually think this is a game.

162
00:08:30,273 --> 00:08:32,909
That's exactly what this is.

163
00:08:32,943 --> 00:08:35,912
I don't need lawyers to fight my battles.

164
00:08:35,946 --> 00:08:37,413
I can simply starve this division

165
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:41,084
of every resource it needs.

166
00:08:41,118 --> 00:08:42,752
I'm going to go see Nora and remind her

167
00:08:42,786 --> 00:08:46,722
just how important I am to the
well-being of this department.

168
00:08:46,756 --> 00:08:50,425
I give her detailed and
incriminating information

169
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:54,096
about our friend Emily, our friend Alec,

170
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,634
and Detective Special Agent
whatever Kiera Cameron here

171
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:00,168
if it's a war you want.

172
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:01,837
And if that still doesn't put a stop

173
00:09:01,871 --> 00:09:04,204
to this clear campaign of harassment

174
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:07,441
then I'm sure the mayor, City Hall,

175
00:09:07,475 --> 00:09:10,277
and some other entities
I have in my back pocket

176
00:09:10,311 --> 00:09:13,380
will perform the roll of jack
boot to your oversized neck

177
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:15,116
and you'll find yourself
running parking tickets

178
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,583
on skid row.

179
00:09:16,618 --> 00:09:22,321
Now either arrest me or
get the hell out of my way.

180
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:30,496
What exactly did you think

181
00:09:30,497 --> 00:09:31,897
you were going to get out of this?

182
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:33,633
The truth.

183
00:09:33,634 --> 00:09:34,801
You remember what that is, don't you?

184
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:37,570
History dictates the
truth, Inspector, not you.

185
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:41,073
Right and wrong.

186
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:42,741
That's all anybody remembers.

187
00:09:42,776 --> 00:09:45,744
Well, I remember when you used
to take down guys like him.

188
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:09,533
You give me the evidence that I need

189
00:10:09,534 --> 00:10:11,468
and I will gladly use
his own Piron initiative

190
00:10:11,503 --> 00:10:13,203
to Guantanamo his ass.

191
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,771
Can I be there when that happens?

192
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:15,638
Oh yeah.

193
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:18,274
And throw away the key.

194
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:20,677
Alec, what are you doing here?

195
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:24,915
Well, I was thinking about my future

196
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:29,585
and how I need to take
it in a new direction.

197
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:32,154
I want to help the police department.

198
00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:34,356
Officially.

199
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,125
Work here?

200
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,127
You need somebody to
take over Betty's duties.

201
00:10:40,464 --> 00:10:41,864
Keep talking.

202
00:10:41,865 --> 00:10:43,833
Betty was a civilian, I'm a civilian.

203
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,034
You guys hire non-police
around here all the time, right?

204
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:47,869
We do, yeah, but come on,

205
00:10:47,903 --> 00:10:50,438
you can get a job with any
tech giant in the world.

206
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:52,140
Yeah, but no tech giant is gonna help me

207
00:10:52,174 --> 00:10:56,544
wipe that smirk off of Kellogg's face.

208
00:10:56,578 --> 00:10:57,978
Sold.

209
00:10:57,979 --> 00:10:58,512
Really?

210
00:10:58,513 --> 00:10:59,180
Yeah.

211
00:10:59,181 --> 00:11:00,681
That's great, thank you.

212
00:11:00,682 --> 00:11:01,916
Welcome aboard.

213
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:03,751
Officially.

214
00:11:03,752 --> 00:11:05,085
I'll have Patrick get the ball rolling.

215
00:11:06,221 --> 00:11:10,824
In the meantime, can you show
Alec to Betty's old office?

216
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:12,259
Fonnegra.

217
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:13,861
Hey, hey.

218
00:11:13,862 --> 00:11:15,262
Guys, hold on.

219
00:11:16,364 --> 00:11:18,431
When?

220
00:11:18,466 --> 00:11:20,699
Alright, send it through.

221
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,001
Well, I could use you right now.

222
00:11:22,002 --> 00:11:23,502
Feel like punching in early?

223
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:24,536
Sure, what happened?

224
00:11:24,537 --> 00:11:26,072
Someone stole all the
superconducting magnets

225
00:11:26,106 --> 00:11:28,507
from Faber University's physics lab.

226
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,643
That's not your every day B&E.

227
00:11:30,644 --> 00:11:31,677
No, it's not.

228
00:11:31,678 --> 00:11:33,813
Witnesses reported them
escaping in a black van.

229
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:35,114
I think it's our guys.

230
00:11:35,115 --> 00:11:37,115
That campus is thick with surveillance.

231
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,251
I'll see if I can track the
van, see where they're headed.

232
00:11:39,252 --> 00:11:40,185
Perfect.

233
00:11:40,186 --> 00:11:41,787
Let's go.

234
00:11:49,095 --> 00:11:50,495
I can work with this.

235
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:53,331
Good.

236
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:56,333
Alec, I have to ask you a favour.

237
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:57,768
Please.

238
00:11:57,803 --> 00:12:00,070
Come to me first with any
information you find out

239
00:12:00,105 --> 00:12:01,972
about the van or Kellogg's soldiers.

240
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:02,840
Great.

241
00:12:02,841 --> 00:12:04,008
I'm on the job for five seconds

242
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:05,575
and you're already asking
me to lie to Carlos?

243
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,280
I'm not asking you to
lie, just to delay a bit.

244
00:12:09,314 --> 00:12:12,949
What's the difference?

245
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,851
Why don't you work your
magic on the van report,

246
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:16,552
see what you can find?

247
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:28,197
Wanna help me clean it up?

248
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:29,832
I'm not the one who decided
to make a dramatic statement

249
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:32,067
about the direction of my life using fire.

250
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:35,070
The mess is on you.

251
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:36,738
Yeah.

252
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:39,942
Oh, you're gonna want to see this.

253
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:42,010
Looks like the complete
Theseus collection can be yours

254
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:44,046
for the low price of free.

255
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:53,387
Find out who did this.

256
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:56,824
Is this you talking, or... Theseus.

257
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:09,702
I've got about 25 black vans
in the area via traffic cams.

258
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:16,609
Awkward.

259
00:13:21,014 --> 00:13:23,548
Maybe you can track where Brad is headed.

260
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:32,557
New construction projects,
condemned buildings...

261
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:33,625
This is Vancouver.

262
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:35,094
You're gonna have to
narrow down your search.

263
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:36,694
Odd energy consumption?

264
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:38,662
Do you know how many
grow-ops are in the city?

265
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:40,131
Ok, I get it, I'm sorry.

266
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:41,699
You're right, you know what you're doing.

267
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:45,836
I will leave you alone, just...
please, come to me first.

268
00:13:45,871 --> 00:13:47,505
Yeah.

269
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:49,107
Thank you.

270
00:14:19,036 --> 00:14:21,203
Where was Kiera going in such a hurry?

271
00:14:21,238 --> 00:14:22,704
Did you get a lead on the van?

272
00:14:22,705 --> 00:14:23,505
Van?

273
00:14:23,506 --> 00:14:25,274
Oh, shit.

274
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:26,975
I've been so busy trying
to configure my computer

275
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:29,510
to the system that I
completely forgot to ask Kiera

276
00:14:29,545 --> 00:14:31,679
where she was going.

277
00:14:31,713 --> 00:14:33,614
She didn't say?

278
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:35,283
No, she didn't say.

279
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,985
Hmm.

280
00:14:39,388 --> 00:14:42,223
So I need you to do me a favour.

281
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:43,658
I want you to track Kiera's CMR

282
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:45,359
and keep me updated on her movements.

283
00:14:45,393 --> 00:14:47,361
Spy on her?

284
00:14:47,362 --> 00:14:48,662
The whole reason we
work so well together is

285
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:49,796
because of our trust in each other.

286
00:14:49,797 --> 00:14:51,298
I can't risk losing that again.

287
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:52,032
I get it.

288
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:55,235
Ok, don't think of it as spying.

289
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,105
Kiera's feelings for Brad have
got her head out of the game.

290
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:01,740
That's gonna get her in a
very dangerous situation.

291
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,210
I just want to ensure that
we're there to protect her

292
00:15:04,244 --> 00:15:05,845
when that happens.

293
00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:09,882
I'll watch out for her,

294
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,785
but you're gonna have
to trust my discretion.

295
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:14,219
Deal.

296
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,924
Oh, I almost forgot.

297
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:23,561
Welcome to the team.

298
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:41,724
Kiera?

299
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:42,758
I'm here.

300
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,194
So these superconducting
magnets got me thinking.

301
00:15:45,228 --> 00:15:47,630
You know that doohicky that you
stole from Kellogg's soldiers?

302
00:15:47,664 --> 00:15:49,398
It is off the scale magnetic

303
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:51,165
and I think I just found the on switch.

304
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,202
What makes you say that?

305
00:15:54,236 --> 00:15:55,804
You kind of have to
see it to understand it,

306
00:15:55,838 --> 00:15:59,240
but it lines up with one
mother of a magnetic field.

307
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:00,976
I drew a line from the precinct

308
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:02,210
and it runs straight into a vacant factory

309
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,679
a few blocks away from the
van's last recorded location.

310
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,014
Piron.

311
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:07,247
Shaboof.

312
00:16:07,248 --> 00:16:09,282
Excuse me?

313
00:16:09,283 --> 00:16:10,384
Nevermind.

314
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:14,021
What would Prion want
with an abandoned factory?

315
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:15,890
It's not scheduled for demo,

316
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:18,392
no phone or internet hook-up.

317
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:21,328
Paid two million over market value.

318
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:23,596
Kellogg must have really
wanted it for something.

319
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:25,765
Well then we need to find
out what that something is.

320
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,333
Send Lucas the details
and meet me at your place

321
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:28,701
as soon as possible.

322
00:16:28,702 --> 00:16:29,869
I haven't even had my first coffee break

323
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,538
and you're asking me to play hooky?

324
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:32,805
Technically, you're not on the clock,

325
00:16:32,806 --> 00:16:34,941
so get out of there and meet me.

326
00:16:34,975 --> 00:16:37,076
And tell Carlos what?

327
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,510
Don't.

328
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:44,215
I hope your plan is better
than your communication skills.

329
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:10,041
Yes?

330
00:17:10,075 --> 00:17:13,744
Hi, I'm Julian Randol.

331
00:17:13,745 --> 00:17:15,144
Theseus.

332
00:17:15,145 --> 00:17:16,947
You know me as Theseus.

333
00:17:19,316 --> 00:17:21,585
Please, come in.

334
00:17:25,823 --> 00:17:29,859
Uh, can I get you some-

335
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,994
No, thanks.

336
00:17:30,995 --> 00:17:34,897
I just want to know why
you published my manifesto.

337
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:36,632
Because I told her to.

338
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,907
Oh good, you're here.

339
00:17:44,908 --> 00:17:46,174
Nice image.

340
00:17:46,175 --> 00:17:48,676
I can almost see the
syringes on the street.

341
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:50,111
What'd you find?

342
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,479
Well, that's just it.

343
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,780
Nothing.

344
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,381
I haven't found a single
work order or city permit

345
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,150
for this location.

346
00:17:56,184 --> 00:17:57,585
But I hacked a nearby traffic cam,

347
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,489
you see Piron trucks bringing in
material and equipment all day.

348
00:18:01,523 --> 00:18:02,991
They're building something.

349
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:05,493
And we won't know what
it is until we get inside.

350
00:18:05,527 --> 00:18:07,861
Garza, you and I will
infiltrate, see what's going on.

351
00:18:07,895 --> 00:18:10,463
Lucas, you'll be on the
outside keeping your eyes open

352
00:18:10,498 --> 00:18:12,165
for any surprises.

353
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,533
I'll be the eye in the sky from here?

354
00:18:13,534 --> 00:18:14,835
Exactly.

355
00:18:14,836 --> 00:18:16,737
So we'll get in, get what we want,

356
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:19,006
we'll get out and meet back here to debrief

357
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,074
and devise any follow-up action.

358
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:22,942
I love it when you talk tactics.

359
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,409
No engagement, Garza.

360
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:25,878
This is recon only.

361
00:18:25,912 --> 00:18:28,547
Says the girl in the
invisible bullet-proof suit.

362
00:18:28,581 --> 00:18:30,816
How am I supposed to get
inside if our targets are home?

363
00:18:30,851 --> 00:18:32,251
Ask nicely?

364
00:18:40,626 --> 00:18:44,863
I'm an admirer of Theseus,
just like our host, Mrs. Kagame.

365
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:53,737
You can do it.

366
00:18:59,443 --> 00:19:01,645
Edward Kagame?

367
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,048
That's it.

368
00:19:04,082 --> 00:19:05,783
Why did you come here?

369
00:19:05,817 --> 00:19:10,387
She published my words
online for everyone to see.

370
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:12,723
I didn't want that.

371
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:17,293
Why not?

372
00:19:17,294 --> 00:19:19,662
What are you afraid of?

373
00:19:19,697 --> 00:19:21,798
I really don't think you'd understand.

374
00:19:21,832 --> 00:19:24,133
I understand more than you think.

375
00:19:24,168 --> 00:19:25,768
For instance, I know that in 20 years

376
00:19:25,803 --> 00:19:27,536
you're gonna organize
the largest revolution

377
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:30,906
against corporate power
the world has ever seen.

378
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,608
Hundreds of thousands will die as a result

379
00:19:33,642 --> 00:19:35,944
and you will lose.

380
00:19:35,978 --> 00:19:37,612
How do you know that?

381
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:39,480
I've seen it.

382
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:47,922
Then you should know exactly
why I can't let that manifesto

383
00:19:47,956 --> 00:19:49,690
influence this child.

384
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:51,491
Don't be a coward.

385
00:19:51,492 --> 00:19:52,593
There is no certainty.

386
00:19:52,594 --> 00:19:54,328
You control your own destiny, Julian.

387
00:19:54,362 --> 00:19:56,897
No, I will not be responsible for a war.

388
00:19:56,898 --> 00:19:57,865
Then don't be.

389
00:19:57,866 --> 00:19:59,600
How am I going to not, huh?

390
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:02,169
I'll second guess every decision
I make for the rest of my life.

391
00:20:02,204 --> 00:20:04,205
As you should.

392
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:06,172
Your influence on the
future has already begun

393
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:09,075
whether you like it or not.

394
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,577
Would you rather bury your head
in the sand or take action now

395
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:13,847
to ensure that your teachings
are never bastardized

396
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:17,583
by fanatics?

397
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:20,186
Can I get anyone a warm-up
on their tea, or...?

398
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,026
No, thank you,

399
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:32,231
but I think I should
just probably be leaving.

400
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,766
Julian.

401
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,636
The world needs you, Julian.

402
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,942
It looks empty.

403
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:48,445
Yet worth protecting.

404
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,047
Piron guards.

405
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,319
Are you sure about this?

406
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:01,291
Yeah, let's do this.

407
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:02,592
Ok, remember, you don't have your CMR

408
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:04,560
so your suit only has
it's minimal functions.

409
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:06,963
Body armour, electro-taser,
active camouflage.

410
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:08,398
Yeah, yeah.

411
00:21:46,101 --> 00:21:47,501
Alec, we've got a problem.

412
00:21:47,535 --> 00:21:51,238
Yeah, you sure do.

413
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:52,605
I got bad news.

414
00:21:52,606 --> 00:21:54,141
Looks like our friends
have been expecting you.

415
00:21:54,175 --> 00:21:57,244
They've got some sort of
high-frequency disruption field.

416
00:21:57,245 --> 00:21:58,212
Anti-cloaking tech.

417
00:21:58,213 --> 00:22:00,247
You'll get five, maybe seven seconds, tops

418
00:22:00,248 --> 00:22:01,481
before it shuts down again.

419
00:22:01,482 --> 00:22:03,283
Who knows how many times.

420
00:22:03,318 --> 00:22:05,184
You want to abort?

421
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:07,987
No, we've come this far.

422
00:22:08,021 --> 00:22:09,421
Let's go.

423
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:35,347
Alec, I hope you're getting this.

424
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:36,781
Yeah, I am.

425
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,983
What am I getting?

426
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:40,517
I have no idea.

427
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:57,066
Seven seconds.

428
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,416
Alec?

429
00:23:18,288 --> 00:23:19,688
Alec!

430
00:23:24,827 --> 00:23:26,594
Ambient energy readings are off the charts.

431
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,733
We need to find out what that thing is.

432
00:23:32,734 --> 00:23:33,500
Who cares?

433
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:35,036
We know it can't be good.

434
00:23:35,037 --> 00:23:36,237
You're right.

435
00:23:36,238 --> 00:23:39,273
We'll need to stop them now,
while they're vulnerable.

436
00:23:39,308 --> 00:23:42,209
What happened to recon only?

437
00:23:42,244 --> 00:23:43,978
They aren't expecting us.

438
00:23:44,012 --> 00:23:46,679
This may be our only chance.

439
00:23:46,713 --> 00:23:48,982
What's the plan?

440
00:23:49,016 --> 00:23:51,051
We destroy it.

441
00:24:07,504 --> 00:24:08,904
Mommy like.

442
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,272
Don't even think about it.

443
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:12,840
Get to work.

444
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,629
Alec, can you isolate what
Brad and Marcellus are saying?

445
00:24:36,664 --> 00:24:40,800
Not from a window from this distance.

446
00:24:40,835 --> 00:24:42,436
What about now?

447
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,636
Try analyzing their lip movements.

448
00:24:44,671 --> 00:24:46,172
I'm too busy trying to
figure out what this thing is

449
00:24:46,173 --> 00:24:47,206
that they're building.

450
00:24:47,207 --> 00:24:48,540
Come on, Alec.

451
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:50,943
I don't understand why you trust this guy.

452
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,244
He killed other you and
if you're not careful

453
00:24:52,245 --> 00:24:53,846
he could do it again.

454
00:25:01,753 --> 00:25:03,521
Time to go.

455
00:25:03,555 --> 00:25:06,691
Once I trigger the fuse I figure
we've got about 90 seconds,

456
00:25:06,692 --> 00:25:07,725
give or take.

457
00:25:07,726 --> 00:25:09,427
Figure?

458
00:25:09,462 --> 00:25:11,929
You're welcome.

459
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,298
I'll be the one that gets it close enough

460
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:14,432
to whatever they're building.

461
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:15,500
No need.

462
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:16,767
There's enough C4 in that baby,

463
00:25:16,768 --> 00:25:18,735
this place will be nothing but
a smoking hole in the ground.

464
00:25:18,736 --> 00:25:19,269
Garza.

465
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,104
What?

466
00:25:20,105 --> 00:25:22,239
The plan was to take that thing down,

467
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,607
not murder everybody in the process.

468
00:25:23,608 --> 00:25:25,376
Why are you always so goddamn soft, Kiera?

469
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,877
It's war, they're the enemy.

470
00:25:26,911 --> 00:25:28,612
If it's not them then it's gonna be us,

471
00:25:28,646 --> 00:25:30,046
and I can't have that.

472
00:25:41,692 --> 00:25:43,092
Holy shit.

473
00:25:43,093 --> 00:25:43,692
What?

474
00:25:43,693 --> 00:25:45,728
Uh... don't blow it up.

475
00:25:45,762 --> 00:25:47,963
Those cylinders are showing
signs of a highly concentrated

476
00:25:47,998 --> 00:25:49,465
anti-matter fusion system.

477
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:50,466
In english please, Alec.

478
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,300
What's he saying?

479
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:53,235
The kind of power to get you home.

480
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:55,270
Or...

481
00:25:55,271 --> 00:25:56,304
Or what?

482
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,673
My hypothesis is if it
is an anti-matter system

483
00:25:58,707 --> 00:26:03,145
then this gadget is some
sort of quantum processor.

484
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:05,514
I just couldn't see it until now.

485
00:26:05,548 --> 00:26:07,482
We need to reassess.

486
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:08,183
Mission aborted.

487
00:26:08,184 --> 00:26:09,183
Let's go.

488
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:10,951
It's Brad, isn't it?

489
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:13,354
You're willing to put
our lives at risk for him.

490
00:26:16,258 --> 00:26:17,658
Garza.

491
00:26:20,795 --> 00:26:22,396
Oh, you really want to do this?

492
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:27,467
Shit.

493
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:38,100
Garza, get up.

494
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:39,035
We've gotta go.

495
00:27:39,036 --> 00:27:40,002
We gotta go now!

496
00:27:40,003 --> 00:27:41,003
We've gotta get out of here.

497
00:27:41,004 --> 00:27:43,739
No.

498
00:27:43,773 --> 00:27:45,173
Garza, no!

499
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:48,844
What the hell was that?

500
00:27:48,845 --> 00:27:49,778
It was me.

501
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:51,446
I installed a fail-safe control on my end.

502
00:27:51,447 --> 00:27:52,380
She'll be fine.

503
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:54,316
Yeah. Great.

504
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,117
But it only works if we make it out alive

505
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:58,353
and right now she's unconscious.

506
00:28:05,962 --> 00:28:08,362
Lucas, it's hitting the fan in there.

507
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:09,796
That's a surprise.

508
00:28:09,797 --> 00:28:10,965
You're gonna have to get closer.

509
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:13,067
Construction's gonna be a little hot.

510
00:28:13,101 --> 00:28:14,501
Copy.

511
00:28:20,808 --> 00:28:23,643
Alec, is Lucas ready yet?

512
00:28:23,678 --> 00:28:25,378
He's standing by the
north side of the building,

513
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,113
up the corridor and to the left.

514
00:28:27,114 --> 00:28:28,114
Ok, got it.

515
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:31,150
Oh, shit.

516
00:28:31,151 --> 00:28:32,218
Ok, look.

517
00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:33,486
They must have found the
one we already took out.

518
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:35,455
Garza?

519
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,189
Are you alright?

520
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,790
Yeah.

521
00:28:37,824 --> 00:28:39,959
What happened?

522
00:28:39,994 --> 00:28:41,961
There are two of them.

523
00:28:41,995 --> 00:28:44,262
Both in cloaking tech.

524
00:28:44,297 --> 00:28:46,598
You know, I don't know
what your game is, Tonkin,

525
00:28:46,632 --> 00:28:48,400
but it's falling apart.

526
00:28:48,401 --> 00:28:49,434
There's no game.

527
00:28:49,435 --> 00:28:50,768
All evidence to the contrary.

528
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:52,004
Enough.

529
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:53,738
We'll have this conversation
after we secure the perimeter.

530
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:54,439
Prove him wrong.

531
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,474
Nobody leaves the building.

532
00:28:55,475 --> 00:28:56,908
You two stay with the others.

533
00:28:56,942 --> 00:28:58,576
Protect the site.

534
00:29:01,413 --> 00:29:02,813
Garza?

535
00:29:02,814 --> 00:29:03,347
Wake up.

536
00:29:03,348 --> 00:29:04,781
What happened?

537
00:29:04,782 --> 00:29:05,816
We've gotta get out of
here now, just trust me.

538
00:29:05,817 --> 00:29:07,485
Up.

539
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:08,919
Fine.

540
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:15,359
This way!

541
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,559
Go, go, go!

542
00:29:27,939 --> 00:29:29,339
Keep them pinned down,

543
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,306
I'll get reinforcements!

544
00:29:32,243 --> 00:29:34,443
They fried our suits!

545
00:29:34,477 --> 00:29:36,245
Alec, they've disabled our tech.

546
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,469
We need another way out, now!

547
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,579
You're at a dead end. The
only way out is through them.

548
00:29:41,084 --> 00:29:43,488
Lucas, they're trapped.

549
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:44,889
They may not make it out without your help.

550
00:29:45,621 --> 00:29:47,722
That's gonna be a little tricky.

551
00:29:48,391 --> 00:29:49,791
Out of the van.

552
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:52,059
Look, if you don't get in there, they die.

553
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,060
I'm trying.

554
00:29:53,061 --> 00:29:54,561
Try harder.

555
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:56,429
Ok, alright.

556
00:29:56,431 --> 00:29:57,831
I'm stepping out.

557
00:29:57,832 --> 00:29:58,632
Alright?

558
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,000
Just be cool.

559
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:01,101
Calm.

560
00:30:01,102 --> 00:30:02,369
Step away from the vehicle.

561
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,637
I'm stepping away.

562
00:30:03,638 --> 00:30:05,305
I'm stepping away.

563
00:30:05,306 --> 00:30:06,640
Sector three, one-

564
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,646
I'm on my way.

565
00:30:16,116 --> 00:30:18,417
Intruders cordoned on
level one west corridor.

566
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:21,220
We won't survive without weapons.

567
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:22,488
Garza, no!

568
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:23,455
Garza!

569
00:30:23,456 --> 00:30:24,456
Aaarrrghh!

570
00:30:24,457 --> 00:30:25,557
Come on!

571
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:27,625
Hiya!

572
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:41,539
I could have helped.

573
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,742
You're welcome.

574
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,178
We should finish this right now.

575
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,378
Why are we running?

576
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,681
Because I don't feel like dying today.

577
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,583
You should see a door straight ahead.

578
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,151
Up ahead.

579
00:31:11,301 --> 00:31:12,702
End of the line for you.

580
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:15,938
No!

581
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:21,610
LUCAS!

582
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:23,879
NO!

583
00:31:23,913 --> 00:31:25,547
LUCAS!

584
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:46,134
We have to go.

585
00:31:46,168 --> 00:31:48,069
We have to go.

586
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,436
He killed Lucas.

587
00:31:49,437 --> 00:31:52,739
What?

588
00:31:52,774 --> 00:31:54,440
How could you?

589
00:32:17,577 --> 00:32:18,977
It's your fault, Kiera.

590
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:19,978
Don't you dare.

591
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,245
We had them kneecapped
and you chickened out.

592
00:32:21,246 --> 00:32:22,313
It's your fault.

593
00:32:22,314 --> 00:32:23,347
I couldn't let you blow it up.

594
00:32:23,348 --> 00:32:25,015
To save that asshole who killed Lucas?

595
00:32:25,017 --> 00:32:26,417
Selfish bitch.

596
00:32:26,418 --> 00:32:28,786
It has nothing to do
with Brad, don't you see?

597
00:32:28,787 --> 00:32:29,953
We could all go home.

598
00:32:29,954 --> 00:32:33,658
Newsflash, you're the only
one who wants to go back.

599
00:32:33,692 --> 00:32:36,160
Lucas died trying to
prevent that shitty future.

600
00:32:36,194 --> 00:32:38,795
You're spitting in his
face wanting to preserve it.

601
00:32:38,796 --> 00:32:39,862
Pull over.

602
00:32:39,863 --> 00:32:40,897
Not until we're clear.

603
00:32:42,065 --> 00:32:43,466
Pull over.

604
00:33:03,486 --> 00:33:04,886
I don't know if you grunts are aware

605
00:33:04,887 --> 00:33:07,723
but moving from this site
has never been an option.

606
00:33:07,757 --> 00:33:09,157
That means we work double time to finish.

607
00:33:09,158 --> 00:33:10,558
I want centuries tripled.

608
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,361
We Vasquez, push Kellogg to
provide us with additional security.

609
00:33:13,395 --> 00:33:17,665
Now it's not a question of if
the police show up, but when.

610
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,100
Understood?

611
00:33:21,303 --> 00:33:23,971
I said, understood?

612
00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:25,606
Who put you in charge?

613
00:33:28,676 --> 00:33:30,210
Excuse me?

614
00:33:30,244 --> 00:33:34,113
This is a military op.

615
00:33:34,148 --> 00:33:38,051
He's now the ranking officer.

616
00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:39,820
Marcellus is dead.

617
00:33:39,821 --> 00:33:40,987
That falls on his head.

618
00:33:40,988 --> 00:33:42,356
He's a goddamn liability.

619
00:33:42,357 --> 00:33:43,990
We took out one of theirs.

620
00:33:43,991 --> 00:33:44,991
That should count for something.

621
00:33:44,992 --> 00:33:46,359
Damn right.

622
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,327
I don't know.

623
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:50,229
What don't you know?

624
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,330
We're soldiers,

625
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:52,865
or did you already forget
the chain of command?

626
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:55,167
I signed up for this mission
and I'm gonna see it through.

627
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:56,068
Yeah, you are.

628
00:33:56,069 --> 00:33:57,236
Will you two act like professionals?

629
00:33:57,237 --> 00:33:58,871
Is this what you wanted?

630
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,976
No.

631
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:08,913
This isn't what Marcellus
would have wanted.

632
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:12,149
Zorin should take command.

633
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,251
The mission is priority.

634
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:14,919
You want to honour Marcellus's sacrifice?

635
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:19,590
This is the best way.

636
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:22,726
Everything from this point
forward has accelerated.

637
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,361
We are in key protocol one.

638
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,130
No ins or outs without my say so.

639
00:34:27,164 --> 00:34:29,099
And get me that key, Tonkin.

640
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,540
Alec?

641
00:34:43,146 --> 00:34:45,281
It's not your fault.

642
00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:47,617
I sent him in there.

643
00:34:47,651 --> 00:34:49,452
I told him you needed help.

644
00:34:49,453 --> 00:34:50,853
It's more complicated than that.

645
00:34:50,854 --> 00:34:52,755
You know it.

646
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,355
What's more complicated?

647
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,360
Did you get a lead on that black van?

648
00:34:59,395 --> 00:35:00,795
Dead end.

649
00:35:02,331 --> 00:35:04,165
So... where were you guys all day?

650
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:06,568
I followed a lead, hit the same dead end.

651
00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:07,836
And I needed to grab some more components

652
00:35:07,837 --> 00:35:09,337
for the system.

653
00:35:09,371 --> 00:35:12,940
It's top notch, just not
exactly CMR compatible, you know?

654
00:35:12,974 --> 00:35:16,477
Yeah.

655
00:35:16,511 --> 00:35:18,412
Get on it.

656
00:35:18,447 --> 00:35:21,381
Make something happen.

657
00:35:23,217 --> 00:35:25,553
Brad is clearly not who you think he is.

658
00:35:25,554 --> 00:35:26,687
So why are you protecting him?

659
00:35:26,688 --> 00:35:27,987
I'm not protecting him.

660
00:35:27,988 --> 00:35:29,722
Why are we lying to Carlos?

661
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:32,592
We need to preserve that
site until we know more.

662
00:35:32,593 --> 00:35:33,660
If what you discovered

663
00:35:33,661 --> 00:35:36,162
about the anti-matter
fuel cells is true, then-

664
00:35:36,196 --> 00:35:37,964
This is all about you, then?

665
00:35:37,998 --> 00:35:39,899
What about Kellogg and his plans?

666
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:41,668
Whatever he's up to

667
00:35:41,702 --> 00:35:43,503
is going to ensure that I get what I want

668
00:35:43,537 --> 00:35:46,505
and Kellogg gets what he deserves.

669
00:36:02,253 --> 00:36:05,623
How did it happen?

670
00:36:05,657 --> 00:36:10,561
Garza and I were investigating
Kellogg's soldiers.

671
00:36:10,596 --> 00:36:11,996
They're building some sort of machine,

672
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,765
I don't know what it's for.

673
00:36:16,668 --> 00:36:19,803
We got in trouble.

674
00:36:19,837 --> 00:36:23,540
Lucas saved our lives.

675
00:36:23,574 --> 00:36:26,009
Thank you for telling me.

676
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:32,849
I know that look.

677
00:36:32,884 --> 00:36:36,519
You blame yourself.

678
00:36:36,553 --> 00:36:38,854
Don't.

679
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:42,391
Lucas knew what the
end game was sure to be.

680
00:36:42,425 --> 00:36:44,426
Next Sonya, Kagame.

681
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,629
All of us.

682
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:51,901
He was always willing to
give his life for the cause.

683
00:36:51,935 --> 00:36:54,636
Doesn't make it any easier.

684
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,438
Your journey was never gonna
be an easy one, protector.

685
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,507
I know.

686
00:36:59,542 --> 00:37:05,542
It's getting harder and harder
to choose which path to take.

687
00:37:07,282 --> 00:37:10,751
Which decisions are the right ones.

688
00:37:10,785 --> 00:37:13,954
I want to do right by everyone

689
00:37:13,988 --> 00:37:18,258
without sacrificing what I need.

690
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:20,427
What do you need?

691
00:37:23,798 --> 00:37:26,166
It doesn't matter.

692
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,401
Look at me.

693
00:37:29,436 --> 00:37:33,405
There's no surrender in this fight.

694
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,407
You've come a long way.

695
00:37:35,442 --> 00:37:38,210
Open your eyes to the truth.

696
00:37:38,244 --> 00:37:40,613
This truth.

697
00:37:40,647 --> 00:37:43,982
Kellogg is more dangerous than any of us.

698
00:37:44,016 --> 00:37:50,016
Greed is his drug and his weakness.

699
00:37:50,155 --> 00:37:55,060
You have to stop him at all costs.

700
00:37:55,094 --> 00:38:01,065
Are you willing to do that?

701
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:03,634
Yes.

702
00:38:03,668 --> 00:38:06,303
Kellogg will not succeed.

703
00:38:22,729 --> 00:38:25,231
Where have you been?

704
00:38:25,266 --> 00:38:27,433
Oh, you know, just out
discovering I may have already

705
00:38:27,467 --> 00:38:29,002
influenced the most dangerous terrorist

706
00:38:29,036 --> 00:38:31,771
since Bin Laden.

707
00:38:31,805 --> 00:38:34,506
How was your night?

708
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,308
Lucas is dead.

709
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:46,718
Wow.

710
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:47,819
Guys like him shouldn't have to die

711
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:51,389
because of guys like us, right?

712
00:38:51,423 --> 00:38:53,124
Yeah.

713
00:38:58,863 --> 00:39:03,534
I think I'm done, Alec.

714
00:39:03,568 --> 00:39:05,436
I just gotta go.

715
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,904
Go where?

716
00:39:06,939 --> 00:39:10,140
Be the author of my own destiny,
just like Lucas said, right?

717
00:39:10,174 --> 00:39:12,742
Wait a second.

718
00:39:12,776 --> 00:39:15,478
I've been reading what you wrote.

719
00:39:15,512 --> 00:39:18,415
Future you.

720
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:20,850
It's actually quite beautiful.

721
00:39:20,884 --> 00:39:25,120
Full of new ideas, unique perspectives.

722
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:27,722
Maybe if I don't become

723
00:39:27,757 --> 00:39:30,759
the evil corporate overlord of the future,

724
00:39:30,793 --> 00:39:33,329
you go on to be come
Mother fricken Theresa.

725
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:37,866
And who knows, maybe in a few decades

726
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,269
we're not trying to kill each other.

727
00:39:43,372 --> 00:39:49,372
Look, all I'm trying to say
is don't fear these words.

728
00:39:49,578 --> 00:39:51,679
People need to see them.

729
00:40:02,223 --> 00:40:04,691
Why don't you grab a glass?

730
00:40:04,725 --> 00:40:07,194
Not thirsty.

731
00:40:07,228 --> 00:40:08,895
Oh, come on.

732
00:40:08,929 --> 00:40:10,530
Your shift is over.

733
00:40:10,564 --> 00:40:13,000
Don't they relax where you came from?

734
00:40:13,034 --> 00:40:15,135
When we're not fighting?

735
00:40:18,338 --> 00:40:21,173
We live.

736
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:23,609
Devour.

737
00:40:23,643 --> 00:40:25,511
Sleep.

738
00:40:25,545 --> 00:40:27,946
Pleasure.

739
00:40:27,981 --> 00:40:31,617
Each other.

740
00:40:31,651 --> 00:40:33,618
I knew we had a lot in common.

741
00:40:36,222 --> 00:40:39,991
Drink with me, and we'll toast to pleasure.

742
00:40:42,228 --> 00:40:44,795
You confuse it for a request.

743
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,998
I insist.

744
00:40:47,033 --> 00:40:49,901
The glasses are behind the bar.

745
00:41:15,492 --> 00:41:19,529
Oh, you are good.

746
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,729
You should have spoken up earlier,

747
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,265
I would have had her fetch two.

748
00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:23,699
No, thank you.

749
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,699
Oh, that's right.

750
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,734
You're a straight from
the bottle kinda gal.

751
00:41:29,038 --> 00:41:31,373
We need to talk about the
little renovation project

752
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:34,742
you have going on with your
new future friends across town.

753
00:41:34,777 --> 00:41:38,080
If you want information
you're gonna have to play nice.

754
00:41:38,114 --> 00:41:40,449
I don't play nice with
people I don't trust.

755
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,615
What's trust got to do with it?

756
00:41:41,616 --> 00:41:47,588
The way I see it, me, them, other me,

757
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:48,855
we're your only option.

758
00:41:48,856 --> 00:41:50,257
Them?

759
00:41:50,292 --> 00:41:51,992
Your new friends?

760
00:41:52,026 --> 00:41:54,962
They killed Lucas today.

761
00:41:54,996 --> 00:41:57,998
That's unfortunate.

762
00:41:58,032 --> 00:41:59,966
He was a good man.

763
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,668
A brilliant man.

764
00:42:02,703 --> 00:42:04,237
In a simple sort of way.

765
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,779
She's good, isn't she?

766
00:42:13,814 --> 00:42:15,547
It's ok, put it down.

767
00:42:15,582 --> 00:42:17,516
Kiera was just leaving.

768
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:21,353
Goodnight.

769
00:42:24,357 --> 00:42:27,559
May I ask you a personal question, Matthew?

770
00:42:27,594 --> 00:42:30,462
Anything.

771
00:42:30,497 --> 00:42:33,998
If nobody can trust you, then tell me:

772
00:42:34,032 --> 00:42:36,100
how can you trust you?
