1
00:01:02,826 --> 00:01:04,694
Hey. Is this a bad time?

2
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,030
Yeah, of course it's a bad time.

3
00:01:08,065 --> 00:01:09,665
I should just leave you alone.

4
00:01:12,435 --> 00:01:14,804
You're all alone.

5
00:01:14,838 --> 00:01:16,638
Well, that's how you work best.

6
00:01:16,673 --> 00:01:18,840
Single-minded, clear.

7
00:01:18,874 --> 00:01:19,874
I remember.

8
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:20,909
Not me.

9
00:01:20,943 --> 00:01:23,544
You remember him.

10
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:24,612
Him?

11
00:01:24,646 --> 00:01:25,714
You.

12
00:01:25,748 --> 00:01:28,116
We're not the same guy.

13
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,051
And I don't like being alone.

14
00:01:30,086 --> 00:01:31,820
Not anymore.

15
00:01:34,623 --> 00:01:40,095
She wasn't the answer.

16
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:42,764
What?

17
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:45,299
Emily...

18
00:01:46,368 --> 00:01:48,436
you weren't meant to be with Emily.

19
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,605
Better she's gone.

20
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:53,173
I changed time to be with her.

21
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:57,778
I love her.

22
00:01:57,812 --> 00:02:01,249
I wanted to tell you before.

23
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:05,419
Emily is...

24
00:02:05,454 --> 00:02:06,454
not my mother.

25
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:11,959
I wanted to tell you,
but you seemed so happy

26
00:02:11,993 --> 00:02:13,059
I didn't want to wreck that.

27
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:15,562
What did you say to her?

28
00:02:15,596 --> 00:02:16,396
She asked.

29
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,096
I told-

30
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:17,797
You drove her away?

31
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:18,698
No, no.

32
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:20,233
I freed her.

33
00:02:20,268 --> 00:02:22,235
Dad, really, it's for the best.

34
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,804
You have no right to
decide what's best for me!

35
00:02:24,838 --> 00:02:26,139
It's my choice, my life!

36
00:02:26,173 --> 00:02:29,842
But I wanted to save
you from making a mistake.

37
00:02:29,877 --> 00:02:31,311
Don't you get it?

38
00:02:31,345 --> 00:02:33,146
I'm not going to become him.

39
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,384
No dark future, no twisted legacy, no son.

40
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:40,887
I'm not your father, Jason.

41
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:46,025
He's an old man in another timeline
who left you behind.

42
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:47,593
Maybe that's for the best.

Every star in the
universe burns out eventually.

45
00:03:46,218 --> 00:03:48,119
Darkness always conquers light.

46
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:54,660
Lucas didn't believe that.

47
00:03:54,694 --> 00:04:00,265
He fought and died for something better.

48
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,135
Now he's counting on us.

49
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,403
Yeah, but when you first got here,

50
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,440
Lucas was part of that darkness.

51
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:12,277
Now you're eulogizing
him like he was righteous.

52
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:14,879
He changed.

53
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:16,414
Did he?

54
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:18,483
Or is it just your
perception of him that changed?

55
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,390
You killed Lucas!

56
00:04:26,424 --> 00:04:27,324
I had no choice!

57
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:28,125
You had a choice!

58
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:30,294
You made it for me!

59
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:31,395
I told you to stay away.

60
00:04:31,429 --> 00:04:33,831
Lucas never would have
been there except for you!

61
00:04:33,865 --> 00:04:35,833
Don't you dare make it my fault.

62
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:36,934
Then who's fault is it?

63
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:38,235
I was trying to save someone.

64
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:39,070
Yeah, Marcellus.

65
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:39,704
You!

66
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,639
I was trying to save you!

67
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:44,407
If Lucas had been captured they
would have tortured him,

68
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:45,575
my cover would have been blown

69
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,143
and you'd be back on that hit list.

70
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:48,745
I protected us.

71
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:51,414
Now Zorin's in charge I'm
still not considered need-to-know

72
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:54,183
and they're questioning my
ability to control you.

73
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:58,254
Lucas's murder didn't buy you any goodwill?

74
00:04:58,288 --> 00:05:00,422
Where does this leave us?

75
00:05:00,456 --> 00:05:04,994
I guess that depends on whether you
still believe we want the same thing.

76
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:07,796
The machine they're building. What is it?

77
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:11,834
You want goodwill, let's start there.

78
00:05:11,868 --> 00:05:14,336
It uses the same
technology as the power suits.

79
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,006
I don't know what it's
for but I'm working on it.

80
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,374
Now, do you have that
tech you stole from us?

81
00:05:22,177 --> 00:05:23,310
I don't have it.

82
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,715
Kiera, if I don't recover that,

83
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,183
Zorin is never going to trust me.

84
00:05:29,217 --> 00:05:30,451
I need that key!

85
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:31,686
Key?

86
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,787
What?

87
00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:33,320
You said key.

88
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:36,357
What is it a key to?

89
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:39,626
Give it back to me and I'll find out.

90
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:43,329
And when you do, use this burner.

91
00:05:43,364 --> 00:05:46,066
I'll contact you when I have something.

92
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,001
It's not easy to believe in you.

93
00:05:50,337 --> 00:05:52,906
Kiera, I am trying to keep you alive.

94
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,141
Help me do that.

95
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:56,942
Stay away.

96
00:06:13,393 --> 00:06:14,693
What was stolen?

97
00:06:14,727 --> 00:06:15,860
One quantum computer.

98
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:18,730
Value: $10 million.

99
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:22,500
This mad scientist shit
screams time-travelers.

100
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:25,636
what do they need it for?

101
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:27,138
No idea.

102
00:06:27,173 --> 00:06:29,007
You talk to Brad?

103
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,775
He warned me to keep my distance.

104
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,976
Let him work from the inside.

105
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:33,678
Really?

106
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:37,147
I want this resolved just
as much as you do.

107
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:42,286
Ok.

108
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:43,821
Well, if anybody can figure
out what this stuff is for,

109
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:45,089
it's Alec.

110
00:06:45,123 --> 00:06:46,691
You know where he is?

111
00:06:51,663 --> 00:06:53,231
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

112
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:55,666
Hey, what are you doing here?

113
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:59,502
I needed to talk to you.

114
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:01,438
You're mad at me.

115
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:04,975
There's no guide to
parenting kids that are twice your age.

116
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,077
I was upset, I didn't
mean to take it out on you.

117
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:08,411
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:10,914
That did a lot of things.

119
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:13,150
I learned to let it go.

120
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:13,884
Water.

121
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:15,418
Duck's back.

122
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:16,220
He was hard on you.

123
00:07:16,254 --> 00:07:17,921
On everyone.

124
00:07:17,956 --> 00:07:20,322
Your mother?

125
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,691
Don't want to talk about her.

126
00:07:22,726 --> 00:07:24,160
I think we should.

127
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,263
I want to have a different kind
of relationship with you.

128
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:29,698
In order to do that we have to be honest.

129
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,237
I need to know who she is.

130
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:37,240
Oh, ok.

131
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:40,977
Not... not alright.

132
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:42,178
Not...

133
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,079
You told me that Emily is not my future.

134
00:07:44,113 --> 00:07:44,913
Your mom is.

135
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:48,316
But I mean now.

136
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,751
That's fate.

137
00:07:49,786 --> 00:07:50,652
Destiny.

138
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:51,519
After all that we've changed,

139
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:54,289
you really still believe in all that?

140
00:07:54,323 --> 00:07:57,859
Let me meet her and then
we can see for ourselves.

141
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,061
No. No.

142
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:00,996
No.

143
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,497
It's a bad, super bad idea.

144
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:03,265
Jason, please.

145
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:05,433
Ok? I'm stuck.

146
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:07,835
I don't know if my
path is fixed, unchangeable.

147
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:09,870
How will I ever know unless
I confront this?

148
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:13,640
But not now, not through me.

149
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:16,376
If our fate is set, the
timing doesn't matter.

150
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:19,847
Please.

151
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:22,449
I don't know if she's even in the city.

152
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:23,117
You can find her, ok?

153
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:24,885
I believe in you.

154
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:30,290
Ok, so you find her and
I'll go fight crime.

155
00:08:30,324 --> 00:08:31,590
Call me later, alright?

156
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:48,908
Hi.

157
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:49,976
Hello.

158
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,977
You can each fill in one of these forms...

159
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:54,046
We're here to make a withdrawal.

160
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,280
This isn't that kind of bank.

161
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:56,148
We're aware.

162
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:57,616
Everybody down, now!

163
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:00,052
Tonkin, this way!

164
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:01,721
How was your reunion?

165
00:09:01,755 --> 00:09:03,188
I did what you asked.

166
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:05,057
You're not the only
one who admired Marcellus.

167
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:06,291
I loved him like a brother.

168
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:07,893
Yeah, well I killed his killer.

169
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:10,863
Maybe it's time you start trusting me.

170
00:09:10,897 --> 00:09:12,530
Grab that.

171
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:13,498
Take it all.

172
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:14,933
We're stealing blood?

173
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:16,634
You'll catch up one of these days.

174
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:21,039
I'm not content, Vasquez.

175
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:23,242
You're the world's most boring babysitter.

176
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:24,376
Marcellus briefed you.

177
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,211
He told me what I wanted to hear.

178
00:09:26,246 --> 00:09:29,881
If anyone knows the power of
seduction and empty flattery,

179
00:09:29,915 --> 00:09:31,048
it's me.

180
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,984
There's no man more devoted to your cause.

181
00:09:35,988 --> 00:09:38,822
Never bullshit a bullshitter.

182
00:09:38,857 --> 00:09:40,291
What's going on?

183
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:46,630
That future you came
from doesn't look so bright.

184
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:48,766
Somewhere along the line I mess up,

185
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,235
and knowing that pains me.

186
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,305
You help me cure that and
I can be very generous.

187
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:57,474
You think it's all about you?

188
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:01,879
Every time I look in the mirror.

189
00:10:01,913 --> 00:10:04,381
Self-belief got me to the
top of the mountain.

190
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,383
I plan to stay.

191
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:08,118
Join me.

192
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:20,763
You told me this might happen.

193
00:10:20,798 --> 00:10:22,632
Unattainable women were
always your Achilles Heel.

194
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,367
Ok.

195
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,872
Tell me something I don't know.

196
00:10:30,907 --> 00:10:32,674
You're a shadow of the man that he is.

197
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,310
Yeah, but I'm the shadow you need.

198
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:36,678
And this shadow wants
to see what he bought.

199
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:38,513
Get in.

200
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:42,418
No shots fired,

201
00:10:42,452 --> 00:10:44,186
they just scared the hell out of everyone

202
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,754
and cleared the place out.

203
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:46,355
Blood.

204
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:47,456
More than 100 litres.

205
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,557
Why?

206
00:10:48,591 --> 00:10:50,058
Maybe they're vampires.

207
00:10:50,092 --> 00:10:52,427
Excuse me?

208
00:10:52,461 --> 00:10:56,397
So mechanical equipment, medical
gear, and now this.

209
00:10:56,432 --> 00:10:59,200
You only need blood if you
plan on spilling a lot of it.

210
00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:00,034
Mmm-hmm.

211
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:01,535
So they plan on going to war.

212
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,703
Against who?

213
00:11:02,737 --> 00:11:04,439
I pulled the security footage.

214
00:11:04,473 --> 00:11:05,806
You won't like it.

215
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:12,346
This is a long play.

216
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,614
Face it, Kiera.

217
00:11:13,648 --> 00:11:15,415
He came here as part of their mission.

218
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,084
It sure looks like he's
back on that playbook.

219
00:11:17,118 --> 00:11:18,218
He killed other you.

220
00:11:18,252 --> 00:11:20,688
And he risked his life
to save me more than once.

221
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,122
He's Jekyll and Hyde.

222
00:11:22,156 --> 00:11:24,892
You really want to gamble
that he's not going to flip again?

223
00:11:24,926 --> 00:11:26,293
I will get to the truth.

224
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:28,128
Then do it.

225
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:32,299
Results in 24 hours or I'm going
to assign this case to someone else.

226
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,977
So I built a three dimensional simulation
of the device based on the telemetry you got.

227
00:11:45,012 --> 00:11:46,746
It should be done in a few minutes.

228
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,881
This has to be for time travel.

229
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,315
Nothing else makes sense.

230
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,551
I'm mapping unknown energy patterns

231
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,919
to incomplete infrastructure.

232
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:54,620
It's the best guess until we learn more.

233
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:56,923
Well, if our best guess is correct,

234
00:11:56,957 --> 00:11:59,992
maybe we don't need Kellogg.

235
00:12:00,027 --> 00:12:03,095
I would trust Kellogg more than
I do Brad at this point.

236
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:04,931
And he can call off the Piron guards if-

237
00:12:04,965 --> 00:12:06,265
If.

238
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:13,204
I want to tell Carlos.

239
00:12:13,238 --> 00:12:16,107
I feel bad leaving
him in the dark like this.

240
00:12:16,141 --> 00:12:19,744
You tell Carlos about the warehouse,
he's gonna rush in with the cavalry.

241
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:21,446
You scattered enough ashes.

242
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:29,087
It's a focal point.

243
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:31,422
These energy patterns
are all over the place.

244
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:33,724
Optical turbulence, non-linearity.

245
00:12:37,963 --> 00:12:41,031
Oh my god.

246
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:43,767
Alec, what just happened?

247
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:46,303
Have they managed to
steal any radioactive isotopes?

248
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:46,804
Deuterium?

249
00:12:46,838 --> 00:12:47,972
Tritium?

250
00:12:48,006 --> 00:12:48,806
I don't know.

251
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,673
Well, you better find out.

252
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,610
This could be a pure fusion weapon.

253
00:12:52,644 --> 00:12:54,712
If they successfully
build and trigger this,

254
00:12:54,746 --> 00:12:57,781
hundreds of thousands die.

255
00:12:57,816 --> 00:12:59,483
No, you can't go there, not alone.

256
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:02,552
I can't stay here and
watch that again and again.

257
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:05,989
Hello?

258
00:13:06,023 --> 00:13:07,223
<i>Where are you?</i>

259
00:13:07,257 --> 00:13:08,324
Coming to find you.

260
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:10,159
<i>Don't.</i>

261
00:13:10,193 --> 00:13:12,461
<i>I'll be at our favourite
park in an hour.</i>

262
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:33,048
Once the transducer ray is linked,

263
00:13:33,082 --> 00:13:35,250
we'll be a few hours away
from a full-spool up test.

264
00:13:35,284 --> 00:13:36,351
How's security?

265
00:13:36,385 --> 00:13:37,886
It's under control.

266
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,987
What's that mean?

267
00:13:39,022 --> 00:13:40,055
Someone's on the monitor all day

268
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:41,923
making sure no one
enters using a cloaking device?

269
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,259
No, I've taken steps to counter it.

270
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:47,195
Man, that's one hell of a ray gun!

271
00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:50,031
Does this thing shoot aliens?

272
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:52,033
Commander insisted on
seeing what he bought.

273
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:53,134
Yeah.

274
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:54,935
The Commander would also like
to know what it's for.

275
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,372
I regret Commander, that's
up to Marcellus to tell you.

276
00:13:58,406 --> 00:14:00,407
He's not here at the moment.

277
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:03,878
Excuse me.

278
00:14:06,982 --> 00:14:08,783
Then what can you tell me, and who are you?

279
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:10,484
Robert Zorin, Commander.

280
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:11,652
Please.

281
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:13,587
Come meet the rest of the team.

282
00:14:27,202 --> 00:14:29,503
Kellogg's soldiers have this device.

283
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:30,470
I'm trying to put all the pieces together

284
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:33,439
but so far it seems
like this is the finale.

285
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,308
It's a fusion bomb?

286
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,875
I'm not sure.

287
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,411
You're never wrong.

288
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:39,579
It's missing something.

289
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:42,215
A key piece of the
puzzle that's not there yet.

290
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:44,317
I have the key.

291
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,585
Wait, you recognize this tech?

292
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:46,485
No, no, no.

293
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,053
The key.

294
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,288
The future key.

295
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:49,888
You.

296
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:52,091
Me.

297
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,826
Mom.

298
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,710
That device they're building is a bomb.

299
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,010
A massive one.

300
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,679
Did you know?

301
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:15,312
No, I don't believe that.

302
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,747
We're not terrorists.

303
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:19,182
Have they stolen any radioactive materials?

304
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:20,651
They stole advanced computers.

305
00:15:20,685 --> 00:15:21,852
Medical supplies.

306
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:24,955
It's not a bomb.

307
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:26,624
Brad, you have to give me something.

308
00:15:26,658 --> 00:15:29,426
I called you, remember?

309
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,129
I saw some documents.

310
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:34,698
An address to a storage facility.

311
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:35,866
They stole something a few days ago,

312
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,032
they never brought it back to the building.

313
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:40,303
It must be stashed there.

314
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:43,506
If it is a bomb, I'll stop them.

315
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,674
And if it's not?

316
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,542
You're still on mission?

317
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,514
I wish we never triggered that beacon.

318
00:15:54,017 --> 00:16:00,656
I was out,
walking a new path with you.

319
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,425
You can't always run from your past.

320
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:06,996
Sometimes you have to confront it head on.

321
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,531
Risk everything for a new future.

322
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:14,970
I want to believe you.

323
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:17,339
Then make that choice.

324
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:50,479
If your intel is good, we could
be walking into a trap.

325
00:16:50,514 --> 00:16:52,080
There's only one way to find out.

326
00:16:52,114 --> 00:16:53,982
That's reassuring.

327
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:59,087
No heat signatures.

328
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:00,822
No explosives.

329
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:15,170
What is that?

330
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:27,648
It's a dialysis machine.

331
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:36,458
Here.

332
00:17:36,492 --> 00:17:38,859
I found her Instagram account.

333
00:17:38,894 --> 00:17:41,662
Really loves cat videos.

334
00:17:41,697 --> 00:17:42,830
You sure?

335
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:44,664
I'm pretty sure I'd
recognize my own mother.

336
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:46,166
Wouldn't you?

337
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:48,235
So I met her in my 30's?

338
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:49,203
How? Did I pursue her,

339
00:17:49,237 --> 00:17:51,871
or was it the other way around?

340
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:53,507
Dad wasn't exactly Mr. Nostalgia.

341
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,609
I never really got the whole story.

342
00:17:58,446 --> 00:18:01,248
Ok, you wanted to see her, you saw her.

343
00:18:01,282 --> 00:18:02,416
Let's go.

344
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,583
I'm hungry. You?

345
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:05,151
Woah, woah!

346
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,385
Time out.

347
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,187
You can't.

348
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:09,322
We've come this far.

349
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:12,358
It's too far!

350
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,927
This is over the edge, no parachute.

351
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:19,098
A little theatrical, isn't it?

352
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:20,899
Even for you.

353
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,401
I've got a fondness for this place.

354
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:27,672
In a strange way, it's home.

355
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,907
Summerville Holdings is
a subsidiary of Piron.

356
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,109
Ok.

357
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,111
We raided a storage locker that
was rented by Summerville,

358
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:37,415
AKA you, and what we found
lead us to a terrorist cell.

359
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,851
So A plus B equals me.

360
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,119
It sure looks that way.

361
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,988
And I'm assuming you can tie me
directly to these terrorists?

362
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,394
Tell me what they're planning, Kellogg.

363
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,463
Or the blood they spill is on your hands.

364
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,532
Well, I wouldn't want that.

365
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,234
You know, if you're looking for someone
who's in bed with the enemy,

366
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,972
why not start with the only person
who's actually been in bed with them?

367
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,306
I have a feeling there's
all kinds of things

368
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,877
Kiera's not telling you.

369
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,880
Everyone's got a blind spot.

370
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,848
She used to be mine.

371
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,917
Hey, maybe now she's yours.

372
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:26,329
Marcellus has requested additional
security personnel.

373
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:29,032
Oh, Marcellus did, did he?

374
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,867
Well, you tell Marcellus,

375
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:34,071
or whoever is in charge now,

376
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:37,340
that I'm tired of being instructed.

377
00:19:37,374 --> 00:19:38,909
I get full mission disclosure

378
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:41,744
or the money and the
personnel tap shuts off.

379
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:50,386
It's just lunch.

380
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:52,422
Say hello, and I'll get a
better sense of who she is.

381
00:19:52,456 --> 00:19:53,489
Sure, sure.

382
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:55,057
You could introduce yourself.

383
00:19:55,092 --> 00:19:56,792
Hey, I'm your future husband.

384
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:59,229
The older guy here is our future kid.

385
00:19:59,263 --> 00:20:00,963
Yeah, she'll fall for you straight away.

386
00:20:00,997 --> 00:20:02,264
It doesn't have to get that weird.

387
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:05,601
It's already a supernova of weird.

388
00:20:05,635 --> 00:20:07,936
There are things I haven't told you.

389
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,138
I really only remember her from pictures.

390
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:12,674
Vid files.

391
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:15,543
She was ill when I was young and she died.

392
00:20:15,577 --> 00:20:17,846
I never really got to know her.

393
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,814
Maybe it should stay that way.

394
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,550
Hey, guys.

395
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:23,351
I hope you haven't
been waiting for too long.

396
00:20:23,385 --> 00:20:25,319
A couple of years, give or take.

397
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:26,721
Just kidding.

398
00:20:26,756 --> 00:20:28,356
You want coffee to start?

399
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,624
Coffee, great.

400
00:20:29,658 --> 00:20:33,661
Um... and for him?

401
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:35,829
Um...

402
00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:37,597
milk.

403
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:41,201
Is something wrong?

404
00:20:41,236 --> 00:20:43,670
No. No.

405
00:20:43,704 --> 00:20:45,705
Well, yeah.

406
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,506
You got no idea.

407
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,877
So, what's good here, Annie?

408
00:20:49,911 --> 00:20:52,846
Uh, the club sandwich is amazing,

409
00:20:52,881 --> 00:20:56,416
and if you want something
sweet the apple pie is great.

410
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,651
Just like mom used to make it.

411
00:20:57,685 --> 00:20:59,386
Ok, that's not good.

412
00:20:59,420 --> 00:20:59,919
No, no.

413
00:20:59,953 --> 00:21:01,488
I gotta go.

414
00:21:03,157 --> 00:21:04,190
Is he ok?

415
00:21:04,224 --> 00:21:06,526
Yeah.

416
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,695
Pie sounds good.

417
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:10,263
Pie.

418
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,845
You want to tell me what's going on?

419
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:28,580
Sliding doors.

420
00:21:28,615 --> 00:21:30,883
Look at them.

421
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:33,820
He's reading the
newspaper and she's got her dog.

422
00:21:33,854 --> 00:21:36,189
You can look up and say hello maybe

423
00:21:36,223 --> 00:21:38,191
and it would be the
start of a whole new life.

424
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:40,258
A future.

425
00:21:40,293 --> 00:21:42,961
Or maybe she carries on and it's nothing.

426
00:21:42,995 --> 00:21:46,365
Passing ships.

427
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:48,701
Every moment is a crossroads.

428
00:21:48,735 --> 00:21:51,603
Yeah, but they're not like us.

429
00:21:51,638 --> 00:21:54,440
They have no idea the implications
of their choices.

430
00:21:54,474 --> 00:21:55,974
Those two could have a life-long romance

431
00:21:56,008 --> 00:22:01,112
or maybe one night he
strangles her in her sleep.

432
00:22:01,147 --> 00:22:04,248
We're trapped, Kiera.

433
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,984
Every choice that we make leads
to a different outcome.

434
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:10,154
It's not as though we can stop making them.

435
00:22:10,188 --> 00:22:11,489
Yeah, but we keep getting confronted

436
00:22:11,523 --> 00:22:13,558
by the futures we create.

437
00:22:13,592 --> 00:22:16,160
We can't be whimsical or impulsive.

438
00:22:16,194 --> 00:22:18,463
There's too much at stake.

439
00:22:18,497 --> 00:22:22,667
We both tried to opt
out once before, remember?

440
00:22:22,701 --> 00:22:24,635
It didn't work out so well, did it?

441
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:28,005
I don't know what to do anymore.

442
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:32,175
I'm terrified of making everything worse.

443
00:22:32,209 --> 00:22:35,512
I have faith in you, Alec.

444
00:22:35,546 --> 00:22:37,080
Yeah.

445
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:38,615
Is that why you invited me here?

446
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,284
A pep talk?

447
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,319
No.

448
00:22:43,354 --> 00:22:46,456
I got a message saying you
wanted to meet me here.

449
00:22:51,862 --> 00:22:54,764
You have a bad habit of
appearing out of shadows.

450
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:58,333
Maybe I'm leading you into the light.

451
00:22:58,368 --> 00:22:59,301
What do you want?

452
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:00,870
The same thing as you.

453
00:23:00,904 --> 00:23:02,638
Somehow I doubt that.

454
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:05,841
Your agenda and your
loyalties have always been suspect.

455
00:23:05,876 --> 00:23:08,477
That was before I
understood my true purpose.

456
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,113
The mystery man the freelancers own?

457
00:23:11,147 --> 00:23:13,382
If it wasn't for the
traveller I wouldn't be here.

458
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:14,482
The only thing that
comes back from the dead

459
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:16,051
are gods and zombies.

460
00:23:16,085 --> 00:23:17,219
So unless you're the second coming-

461
00:23:17,253 --> 00:23:18,787
Multiple timelines.

462
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:20,956
You know they exist.

463
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,024
Different branches,

464
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:24,726
different versions of ourselves.

465
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,861
My consciousness was
pulled from one reality,

466
00:23:26,896 --> 00:23:29,331
brought here, fused.

467
00:23:29,365 --> 00:23:32,000
The energy of one reanimating the other.

468
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,167
People aren't car batteries,

469
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:34,502
you can't just jump-start them.

470
00:23:34,537 --> 00:23:36,504
You mock what you don't understand.

471
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:37,705
Because there's no scientific precedent.

472
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,974
It's beyond the bounds of possibility.

473
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:42,977
So is time travel until
you make it possible.

474
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:45,547
You open a door that can never be closed.

475
00:23:45,581 --> 00:23:47,549
With help from the
traveller we can prevent the ripples

476
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,417
from becoming tsunamis.

477
00:23:53,188 --> 00:23:54,922
This time-traveller.

478
00:23:54,957 --> 00:23:56,557
Why did he bring you back?

479
00:23:56,591 --> 00:23:58,225
What does he want?

480
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:02,964
To make things right.

481
00:24:02,966 --> 00:24:06,434
<i>He came from a time
hundreds of years from now.</i>

482
00:24:06,468 --> 00:24:09,670
<i>He was chosen, sent
back to observe history.</i>

483
00:24:09,704 --> 00:24:13,140
<i>To chronicle it, but
not to interfere.</i>

484
00:24:16,711 --> 00:24:19,412
Somewhere in time the
traveller changed something.

485
00:24:19,447 --> 00:24:21,381
Exist.

486
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:23,550
With no clear path to repair it,

487
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:25,452
he went further back in time.

488
00:24:25,487 --> 00:24:27,220
Found acolytes.

489
00:24:27,254 --> 00:24:28,722
Freelancers.

490
00:24:28,756 --> 00:24:29,890
They failed.

491
00:24:29,924 --> 00:24:30,624
You break time,

492
00:24:30,658 --> 00:24:32,058
everyone suffers the consequences

493
00:24:32,093 --> 00:24:33,460
whether they know it or not.

494
00:24:33,495 --> 00:24:35,729
But there's still a chance.

495
00:24:35,763 --> 00:24:37,797
He's here for a reason.

496
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:39,599
Something about the way
things are unfolding,

497
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:42,369
taking place now, has given him hope.

498
00:24:42,403 --> 00:24:43,870
A moment is coming,

499
00:24:43,904 --> 00:24:46,439
a chance to repair everything.

500
00:24:46,474 --> 00:24:48,141
The two of you, Brad,

501
00:24:48,175 --> 00:24:49,209
the machine they're building,

502
00:24:49,243 --> 00:24:52,812
all will play their part.

503
00:24:52,846 --> 00:24:54,147
So it's our job to fix time?

504
00:24:54,181 --> 00:24:55,315
Are you serious?

505
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:56,782
You invented time travel.

506
00:24:56,817 --> 00:24:58,651
Doesn't it make sense that you help put

507
00:24:58,685 --> 00:25:01,353
the genie back in the bottle?

508
00:25:02,556 --> 00:25:03,489
No.

509
00:25:03,524 --> 00:25:04,857
No, I don't buy it.

510
00:25:04,892 --> 00:25:07,159
All this pseudo-science is
just metaphysical bullshit.

511
00:25:07,193 --> 00:25:08,694
I'm out.

512
00:26:01,512 --> 00:26:03,714
Holy shit!

513
00:26:07,093 --> 00:26:10,795
What is this? What's happening?

514
00:26:10,831 --> 00:26:14,633
I don't know. Who are you?

515
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,341
I forgot how innocent I was.

516
00:26:25,312 --> 00:26:27,080
You're me.

517
00:26:27,114 --> 00:26:29,548
How is this happening?

518
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:34,819
Are you in my dream or am I in yours?

519
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:37,256
This is not a dream.

520
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:40,425
It's a paradox.

521
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:42,327
He must have wanted us to meet.

522
00:26:42,362 --> 00:26:43,762
He?

523
00:26:43,796 --> 00:26:45,730
The traveller.

524
00:26:45,765 --> 00:26:48,133
The time traveller.

525
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,968
Time travel?

526
00:26:50,003 --> 00:26:52,404
A theory no longer, it seems.

527
00:26:52,438 --> 00:26:54,506
We're way beyond theory.

528
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,307
Everything that you've done,

529
00:26:55,341 --> 00:26:57,675
all the dominos that have fallen?

530
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,611
I haven't done anything.

531
00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:01,245
Yet.

532
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:08,018
But now I'm thinking perhaps
it's not a good idea.

533
00:27:13,557 --> 00:27:15,158
So what is this?

534
00:27:15,192 --> 00:27:17,593
The universe is shifting,

535
00:27:17,628 --> 00:27:21,497
sweeping destiny along with it.

536
00:27:21,532 --> 00:27:24,334
Because I met Annie.

537
00:27:24,368 --> 00:27:26,869
You're not supposed to meet her yet.

538
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:33,609
You loved her.

539
00:27:33,644 --> 00:27:35,878
Profoundly.

540
00:27:35,913 --> 00:27:37,879
In spite of myself.

541
00:27:40,516 --> 00:27:43,785
How long were you
together before she became ill?

542
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,121
Who told you that?

543
00:27:46,156 --> 00:27:49,524
That's a story we fed to others.

544
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:50,525
I...

545
00:27:55,065 --> 00:27:58,633
I killed her.

546
00:27:58,668 --> 00:28:01,903
She came to see me for who I really am.

547
00:28:01,938 --> 00:28:04,406
She... she ran.

548
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:07,209
She tried to escape, with our son, Jason.

549
00:28:07,243 --> 00:28:10,846
Before I could track them down...

550
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,049
she took her own life.

551
00:28:15,084 --> 00:28:19,721
I destroyed her and I
lost myself because of it.

552
00:28:23,058 --> 00:28:26,361
I can't undo it, but you can.

553
00:28:28,731 --> 00:28:31,199
How?

554
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:34,135
If I could think I'd known
how I would have done it.

555
00:28:39,741 --> 00:28:43,176
You're the me that's
supposed to have all the answers.

556
00:28:43,211 --> 00:28:46,079
Maybe it's the other way around.

557
00:28:46,114 --> 00:28:48,983
Maybe I'm here to learn from you.

558
00:28:53,555 --> 00:28:55,689
Of course.

559
00:28:55,724 --> 00:28:57,725
The message.

560
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:59,226
Kiera.

561
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,861
Kiera?

562
00:29:00,896 --> 00:29:03,363
Kiera Cameron, the one that...

563
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:05,666
never mind.

564
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,069
Yeah, you've made mistakes,
but your instincts are right.

565
00:29:09,103 --> 00:29:12,772
Time travel, the power to change things?

566
00:29:12,806 --> 00:29:15,409
It's not an experiment.

567
00:29:15,443 --> 00:29:17,110
It's the answer.

568
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,281
Do it.

569
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:30,390
Thank you.

570
00:29:41,802 --> 00:29:44,136
I don't understand.

571
00:29:44,171 --> 00:29:46,072
You will.

572
00:29:46,106 --> 00:29:49,909
The power generator in the room
below triggers the device.

573
00:29:49,944 --> 00:29:51,844
Send them back.

574
00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:53,212
Why me?

575
00:29:53,246 --> 00:29:56,950
Because you will inherit
my failure if I don't succeed,

576
00:29:56,984 --> 00:29:58,952
and I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

577
00:30:02,122 --> 00:30:04,523
You can count on me, father.

578
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,461
I speak to you, not as who you'll become,

579
00:30:09,495 --> 00:30:11,930
but as an old man who knows you best.

580
00:30:11,965 --> 00:30:15,200
I have gone down a dangerous path

581
00:30:15,234 --> 00:30:18,637
and I have taken the world with me.

582
00:30:30,382 --> 00:30:31,382
What the hell?

583
00:30:42,595 --> 00:30:44,061
Alec?

584
00:30:44,096 --> 00:30:45,497
Oh my god!

585
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:50,668
Oh my god, what happened?

586
00:30:50,702 --> 00:30:52,003
Are you ok?

587
00:31:03,102 --> 00:31:05,203
As per your request.

588
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,339
VPD case files on all the robberies
that are being linked

589
00:31:07,374 --> 00:31:10,408
to this new group of terrorists.

590
00:31:10,442 --> 00:31:11,743
Terrorists?

591
00:31:11,778 --> 00:31:13,211
That's a little harsh.

592
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:17,849
You're annoyed.

593
00:31:17,884 --> 00:31:19,117
Those files are classified.

594
00:31:19,152 --> 00:31:20,118
I don't work there anymore,

595
00:31:20,153 --> 00:31:22,954
I had no business taking them.

596
00:31:22,989 --> 00:31:24,189
It's not our fault they didn't lock them-

597
00:31:24,223 --> 00:31:26,324
Please don't ask me to do that again.

598
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:31,596
Piron is the VPD.

599
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,898
The VPD is Piron.

600
00:31:33,932 --> 00:31:35,465
We're one big happy family.

601
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,434
Is that why I'm here?

602
00:31:37,468 --> 00:31:39,436
The key to a lock you're
not supposed to open?

603
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,772
Jack, please.

604
00:31:41,807 --> 00:31:43,240
What, you think I'm manipulating you?

605
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:44,541
I'm contacting Carlos

606
00:31:44,575 --> 00:31:46,376
and I am having my access revoked.

607
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:48,813
Do you really think your precious VPD

608
00:31:48,847 --> 00:31:53,050
would have taken care
of you the way I have?

609
00:31:53,084 --> 00:31:56,386
Picked you up when you
couldn't stand on your own two feet?

610
00:31:56,421 --> 00:31:59,123
Restored your dignity?

611
00:31:59,157 --> 00:32:02,559
Well, I really didn't
give it a chance, did I?

612
00:32:02,593 --> 00:32:06,463
You've got a bright future here, Jack.

613
00:32:06,497 --> 00:32:11,134
But to embrace it, you
gotta let go of the past.

614
00:32:11,168 --> 00:32:13,704
Can you do that?

615
00:32:20,378 --> 00:32:20,977
Curtis said

616
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:22,379
"a moment is coming."

617
00:32:22,413 --> 00:32:25,349
"A chance to repair everything."

618
00:32:25,383 --> 00:32:26,850
What did he mean?

619
00:32:26,884 --> 00:32:28,451
How is Brad a part of it?

620
00:32:28,485 --> 00:32:29,752
The universe is shifting,

621
00:32:29,786 --> 00:32:31,787
sweeping destiny along with it.

622
00:32:31,822 --> 00:32:33,323
You sound like Curtis.

623
00:32:33,357 --> 00:32:34,790
It's just something I heard in a dream.

624
00:32:34,825 --> 00:32:37,193
Or, not a dream.

625
00:32:37,228 --> 00:32:38,494
I better get back to work.

626
00:32:38,528 --> 00:32:41,097
We have to trust ourselves, each other.

627
00:32:41,131 --> 00:32:44,033
There's no turning back now.

628
00:32:44,068 --> 00:32:45,600
Something happened to you back there.

629
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:47,236
Yeah.

630
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,238
I'm not afraid anymore.

631
00:32:52,942 --> 00:32:54,009
Carlos?

632
00:32:54,043 --> 00:32:55,443
Give us a sec, would you?

633
00:32:55,478 --> 00:32:56,778
Alec.

634
00:32:59,115 --> 00:33:00,715
You know, I've seen
Vegas magicians disappear

635
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,684
less than you.

636
00:33:02,718 --> 00:33:04,118
And you know who else keeps vanishing?

637
00:33:04,152 --> 00:33:06,520
I have no idea where Kiera is.

638
00:33:06,554 --> 00:33:07,488
Really?

639
00:33:07,522 --> 00:33:08,722
Really.

640
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:12,459
You remember when Kiera
Cameron supposedly worked

641
00:33:12,494 --> 00:33:14,528
for Section Six and you
were the kid in the barn

642
00:33:14,562 --> 00:33:17,698
keeping her secrets and
I was the guy in the dark?

643
00:33:17,732 --> 00:33:19,800
Did we just time travel back there again?

644
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:23,470
It's not like that.

645
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:24,571
Alec, look.

646
00:33:24,606 --> 00:33:26,373
I get loyalty, ok?

647
00:33:26,408 --> 00:33:27,508
I do.

648
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:30,210
I've been keeping her secrets
for a very long time.

649
00:33:30,244 --> 00:33:31,077
I wouldn't be asking this

650
00:33:31,112 --> 00:33:34,715
if I didn't think she was in danger.

651
00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:37,250
So why don't you tell me where she is?

652
00:33:37,285 --> 00:33:39,753
Right now, because I'm done playing games.

653
00:33:57,604 --> 00:34:00,807
It's hard for me to see him in you.

654
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:03,709
Well, people change.

655
00:34:03,744 --> 00:34:05,311
So I hear.

656
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:13,285
You're risking your lives for him.

657
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,253
Why?

658
00:34:14,287 --> 00:34:16,721
Because he risked his for us.

659
00:34:16,756 --> 00:34:17,722
He hauled off our enemies,

660
00:34:17,757 --> 00:34:21,860
he used his guile and
resources to buy time.

661
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,462
Even though his was running out.

662
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:25,630
Running out?

663
00:34:25,665 --> 00:34:27,632
Kidney failure.

664
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:29,901
He's dying?

665
00:34:29,936 --> 00:34:32,704
It's treatable.

666
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,172
Huh.

667
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:41,245
If he gets a transplant.

668
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,814
Bad habits.

669
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:46,149
They're gonna be the death of you one day.

670
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,243
Hey.

671
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,144
Hey.

672
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:15,979
You need to see this.

673
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:18,148
I've been working on your simulations.

674
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:21,018
Something wasn't right.

675
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,419
Cellinoid coils.

676
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,786
Yeah, what about them?

677
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:24,787
Well, if they rigged them all up together

678
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:26,422
they could use them as a transducer.

679
00:35:26,456 --> 00:35:27,656
Look.

680
00:35:29,626 --> 00:35:31,827
How did I miss that?

681
00:35:31,861 --> 00:35:34,263
Distracted?

682
00:35:34,297 --> 00:35:37,333
I'm running some new algorithms right now.

683
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:38,300
There.

684
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:40,403
These should be up in a minute or so.

685
00:35:49,111 --> 00:35:51,847
So what happened after I left?

686
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:53,549
With my mother?

687
00:35:56,252 --> 00:35:58,219
She's not for me, Jason.

688
00:35:58,254 --> 00:35:59,220
She's sweet, she's innocent,

689
00:35:59,255 --> 00:36:03,224
I don't want to take that from her.

690
00:36:03,259 --> 00:36:05,193
The only way for me to
walk a new and better path

691
00:36:05,227 --> 00:36:09,130
is for me to not
follow in my own footsteps.

692
00:36:09,165 --> 00:36:11,232
I'm sorry.

693
00:36:11,267 --> 00:36:14,835
So I never get born?

694
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,737
You did.

695
00:36:16,772 --> 00:36:19,506
You're here and so am I.

696
00:36:19,541 --> 00:36:21,909
That's never gonna change.

697
00:36:25,213 --> 00:36:26,847
Here we go.

698
00:36:31,753 --> 00:36:33,854
That doesn't look like a bomb.

699
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:38,459
You genius!

700
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:43,763
It's not!

701
00:36:43,798 --> 00:36:45,398
It's not!

702
00:36:48,202 --> 00:36:49,069
<i>Kellogg?</i>

703
00:36:49,103 --> 00:36:51,304
<i>This better be life or death.</i>

704
00:36:51,338 --> 00:36:53,306
I couldn't have said it better myself.

705
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,774
What do you want?

706
00:36:54,809 --> 00:36:57,276
What you said, before.

707
00:36:57,311 --> 00:36:59,412
It makes sense to me now.

708
00:36:59,446 --> 00:37:00,947
I can't trust myself.

709
00:37:00,982 --> 00:37:02,081
Wow.

710
00:37:02,115 --> 00:37:03,749
And I thought
narcissistic sociopaths weren't capable

711
00:37:03,783 --> 00:37:05,784
of self-evaluation.

712
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:08,053
I guess this one is.

713
00:37:08,088 --> 00:37:10,789
I'd screw anyone over.

714
00:37:10,824 --> 00:37:12,791
Even me.

715
00:37:12,826 --> 00:37:15,127
Are you drunk?

716
00:37:15,161 --> 00:37:16,962
Not drunk enough.

717
00:37:19,565 --> 00:37:21,900
We need to work together.

718
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:26,805
Brad, Marcellus, what
they're up to, it's bad.

719
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,041
<i>For you and me.</i>

720
00:37:29,075 --> 00:37:31,209
I'm not gonna take you seriously.

721
00:37:31,244 --> 00:37:34,112
I am dead serious.

722
00:37:34,147 --> 00:37:38,150
Emphasis on the dead.

723
00:37:38,184 --> 00:37:41,286
I am the last person in the
world you should trust,

724
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,787
which is why,

725
00:37:42,821 --> 00:37:47,526
<i>in this case, you have to trust me.</i>

726
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,463
Give me one reason
why I would ever do that.

727
00:37:51,497 --> 00:37:56,934
Because I'm the guy
holding your golden ticket.

728
00:37:56,969 --> 00:37:59,538
The only means to send you home.

729
00:37:59,572 --> 00:38:01,539
<i>Think about it.</i>

730
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,642
VPD busted the locker.

731
00:38:04,676 --> 00:38:06,076
They have the dialysis machine.

732
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,645
What?

733
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:09,313
You were supposed to divert
her, keep her from here,

734
00:38:09,347 --> 00:38:10,814
not give her something that we need.

735
00:38:10,848 --> 00:38:11,748
She's smart.

736
00:38:11,783 --> 00:38:13,917
She wasn't gonna be distracted for long.

737
00:38:13,951 --> 00:38:14,918
We'll get another one.

738
00:38:14,952 --> 00:38:16,153
We're running out of time.

739
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,161
She's near the building?

740
00:38:24,195 --> 00:38:25,162
Yeah, let me talk to her.

741
00:38:25,196 --> 00:38:26,496
I'll get her to leave.

742
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:27,698
Take care of it.

743
00:38:27,732 --> 00:38:28,364
No, you don't!

744
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:29,432
Tonkin, take it easy.

745
00:38:29,466 --> 00:38:31,634
You, stand down.

746
00:38:31,669 --> 00:38:33,036
Put that down.

747
00:38:35,139 --> 00:38:36,506
Tonkin?

748
00:38:40,411 --> 00:38:42,979
Ok.

749
00:38:43,014 --> 00:38:44,480
You want to know what we're doing?

750
00:38:48,885 --> 00:38:51,887
We're building a portal.

751
00:38:51,922 --> 00:38:53,389
A lifeboat.

752
00:38:53,424 --> 00:38:54,824
To rescue our people.

753
00:38:54,858 --> 00:38:56,792
They escape our time, they come here.

754
00:38:56,827 --> 00:38:58,194
There's hundreds of names on that list.

755
00:38:58,229 --> 00:38:59,662
Take a look.

756
00:39:02,433 --> 00:39:05,101
Now you see?

757
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,937
Emma Tonkin?

758
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:08,838
My sister.

759
00:39:08,872 --> 00:39:10,072
Yeah.

760
00:39:10,107 --> 00:39:11,741
And her two kids.

761
00:39:11,775 --> 00:39:13,409
Your nephews.

762
00:39:13,444 --> 00:39:15,010
Just waiting to come through.

763
00:39:15,045 --> 00:39:16,912
No.

764
00:39:16,947 --> 00:39:18,748
No, they died in the Squamish massacre.

765
00:39:18,782 --> 00:39:20,482
No, they survived.

766
00:39:20,516 --> 00:39:21,851
All of them.

767
00:39:21,885 --> 00:39:27,823
But if you sabotage
this, they die for sure.

768
00:39:27,858 --> 00:39:33,528
Is that what you want?

769
00:39:33,563 --> 00:39:36,799
You let me handle her my way.

770
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,908
I thought I had been clear.

771
00:39:46,942 --> 00:39:48,410
Clear isn't exactly the word I would use.

772
00:39:48,444 --> 00:39:49,578
Did you really think I wouldn't find out

773
00:39:49,612 --> 00:39:51,846
you had been tracking me?

774
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:52,947
I was trying to keep you safe.

775
00:39:52,982 --> 00:39:55,183
By protecting them?

776
00:39:55,217 --> 00:39:57,051
Maybe you've been playing me since we met.

777
00:39:57,086 --> 00:39:58,353
What we had was never false.

778
00:39:58,388 --> 00:39:58,953
Had.

779
00:39:58,988 --> 00:40:00,422
Past tense.

780
00:40:05,461 --> 00:40:07,862
The ground keeps shifting.

781
00:40:07,897 --> 00:40:09,598
Maybe we don't want
the same things anymore.

782
00:40:09,632 --> 00:40:13,067
Maybe you should just kill me.

783
00:40:13,102 --> 00:40:14,703
Isn't that what you came here to do?

784
00:40:14,737 --> 00:40:18,706
Look, I swear, Kiera, what
is happening is not dangerous.

785
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,609
You need to walk away and let
us do what we have to do.

786
00:40:21,643 --> 00:40:23,912
I can't.

787
00:40:23,946 --> 00:40:27,481
You hold the key to me getting what I want.

788
00:40:27,516 --> 00:40:29,250
Put the gun down.

789
00:40:32,121 --> 00:40:33,254
It's not gonna happen.

790
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:34,289
You came here to kill her.

791
00:40:34,323 --> 00:40:35,957
Now put it down.

792
00:40:35,991 --> 00:40:39,127
It's not that simple, Carlos.

793
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:41,129
He murdered the other you.

794
00:40:41,163 --> 00:40:41,963
He's not your ally.

795
00:40:41,997 --> 00:40:43,331
Open your eyes.

796
00:40:43,365 --> 00:40:45,300
Kiera, after everything we've been through

797
00:40:45,334 --> 00:40:47,401
I need you to hear me.

798
00:40:47,436 --> 00:40:50,003
You get him out of here
or he ends up like Lucas.

799
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:56,243
I am sorry I didn't tell you.

800
00:40:58,579 --> 00:40:59,346
I already knew.

801
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,513
Now get the hell out of the way.

802
00:41:00,548 --> 00:41:02,950
It was something I wanted so badly

803
00:41:02,984 --> 00:41:04,885
I thought I couldn't tell you.

804
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:15,863
Maybe I can't trust him, but I need him.

805
00:41:28,075 --> 00:41:28,875
I didn't want to tell him where you were,

806
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:30,376
but he forced my hand.

807
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,011
Alec, it's ok.

808
00:41:32,045 --> 00:41:34,446
No more deception.

809
00:41:34,481 --> 00:41:36,515
Tell him what we know.

810
00:41:36,549 --> 00:41:40,186
Well, it's gonna be news to you, too.

811
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,955
Jason found the missing
piece of the puzzle.

812
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:45,556
Everything's changed.

813
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:47,192
The energy patterns here?

814
00:41:47,226 --> 00:41:48,593
They're not explosive.

815
00:41:48,627 --> 00:41:50,295
They're implosive.

816
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:51,729
The device is literally punching a hole

817
00:41:51,764 --> 00:41:53,965
in the space-time continuum.

818
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,101
And what is that?

819
00:41:56,135 --> 00:41:58,937
It's a tethered wormhole.

820
00:41:58,971 --> 00:42:00,372
Uh, you want to try explaining that to me

821
00:42:00,406 --> 00:42:02,840
like I don't have a degree in physics?

822
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:04,709
Sure.

823
00:42:04,743 --> 00:42:06,177
It's like an elevator,

824
00:42:06,212 --> 00:42:07,344
but instead of going up and down

825
00:42:07,379 --> 00:42:08,546
it moves through time.

826
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,214
A time elevator?

827
00:42:10,248 --> 00:42:14,385
A portal through time between
now and the future.

828
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,054
The energy provides a
stable limited connection.

829
00:42:17,088 --> 00:42:20,057
That's why they needed to
build it in that exact location.

830
00:42:20,091 --> 00:42:21,859
The two sides need to be exactly the same

831
00:42:21,894 --> 00:42:24,762
in both time periods or
else it's not gonna work.

832
00:42:24,797 --> 00:42:28,198
They are very likely bringing
people back from their future.

833
00:42:28,233 --> 00:42:29,434
The supplies they've stolen?

834
00:42:29,468 --> 00:42:30,167
Blood?

835
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:31,168
Medicine?

836
00:42:31,202 --> 00:42:33,503
Those are the kinds of
things an army needs.

837
00:42:33,538 --> 00:42:36,173
Yeah, for an invasion.

838
00:42:36,207 --> 00:42:38,575
We have to stop it.

839
00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:40,677
Yeah, of course we do.

840
00:42:40,711 --> 00:42:44,548
But there's also a very tiny silver
lining to this dark cloud.

841
00:42:44,582 --> 00:42:47,851
That's a temporal
matrix running within a cortex.

842
00:42:47,885 --> 00:42:50,087
It's a two-way street.

843
00:42:50,121 --> 00:42:51,755
With the time ball and their power source,

844
00:42:51,789 --> 00:42:54,158
it may be possible to hybridize
it so you could-

845
00:42:54,192 --> 00:42:56,293
Travel forward.

846
00:42:59,363 --> 00:43:01,130
You asked me to send you home.

847
00:43:04,134 --> 00:43:06,369
With this machine complete,

848
00:43:06,403 --> 00:43:08,905
I'm almost certain I can do exactly that.
