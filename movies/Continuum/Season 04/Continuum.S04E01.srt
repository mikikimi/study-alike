1
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,886
<i>My name is Kiera Cameron,</i>

2
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:10,857
<i>and I came here  from the year 2077.</i>

3
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:13,808
Evolution is on our schedule.

4
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:15,415
The war begins now.

5
00:00:15,925 --> 00:00:17,657
Emily, it's ok.

6
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:19,004
I love you, too.

7
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,003
Emily!

8
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:26,701
I have to accept the truth.

9
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:28,432
That I may never get back to him.

10
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:30,634
That doesn't mean I have to stop trying.

11
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:32,002
That's all I've ever wanted.

12
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:36,139
To put the pieces back together
and return to my family.

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,373
I'm sorry, Kiera.

14
00:00:37,374 --> 00:00:39,942
Alec, I can go home!

15
00:00:39,943 --> 00:00:42,477
I know.

16
00:00:42,478 --> 00:00:44,378
But I have to save her.

17
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:46,911
Emily, I travelled through time for you.

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,748
You.

19
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:52,182
I choose you.

20
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:54,284
So I guess we're not
gonna be pals then, huh?

21
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:56,052
I don't see how.

22
00:00:56,053 --> 00:00:57,653
<i>There are two Alec Sadlers.</i>

23
00:00:57,654 --> 00:00:59,221
<i>He made the time device work.</i>

24
00:00:59,222 --> 00:01:00,689
He traveled back to change things

25
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,857
and created another timeline.

26
00:01:02,858 --> 00:01:04,525
This one.

27
00:01:04,526 --> 00:01:06,293
<i>That's what created  the ultimate future</i>

28
00:01:06,294 --> 00:01:08,094
<i>that this guy comes from.</i>

29
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:10,429
Travelers lead, let's
knock all the dominos down.

30
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,565
When things get too hairy,
I want you to use this.

31
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:16,933
Alright, let's let the big
man himself send you off.

32
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:19,102
Sir.

33
00:01:19,103 --> 00:01:20,703
You want to cheat death, Kellogg?

34
00:01:20,704 --> 00:01:22,838
Help me, and I'll teach you how.

35
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:25,040
I'm just a cog in the machine now, Carlos.

36
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,875
I don't get to play chess master anymore.

37
00:01:26,876 --> 00:01:28,276
Somehow I doubt that.

38
00:01:28,277 --> 00:01:30,845
That was yesterday.

39
00:01:30,846 --> 00:01:32,613
She is a heartbreaker.

40
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:35,849
<i>You are under arrest for the
attempted murder of Alec Sadler.</i>

41
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,218
This timeline isn't big
enough for the both of us.

42
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:40,085
I couldn't agree more.

43
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,192
I have been getting the
other Alec to sign documents

44
00:01:47,193 --> 00:01:52,529
that remove him and
put me in the big chair.

45
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,764
This will send a signal.

46
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:58,267
If nobody hears it, nothing happens.

47
00:01:58,268 --> 00:02:01,003
And if someone does hear it?

48
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:03,104
Then we've failed.

49
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,124
Mr. Sadler is dropping all charges.

50
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,325
Right.

51
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:25,925
All yours.

52
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:49,848
You did it.

53
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:51,583
Thank you so much, Carlos.

54
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:52,684
We really appreciate it.

55
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:53,767
Good.

56
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:54,852
You can reciprocate by
getting Piron to support

57
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:57,387
my department's requests
now that it's finally

58
00:02:57,388 --> 00:03:01,123
in the hands of a sane person.

59
00:03:01,124 --> 00:03:03,625
Alright, what happened?

60
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:06,260
Kellogg happened.

61
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:07,877
He tricked other me

62
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:09,496
into turning over control
of the company to him.

63
00:03:09,497 --> 00:03:11,164
I've been kicked out.

64
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,399
Why am I not surprised?

65
00:03:15,535 --> 00:03:18,003
I wonder what the future will hold.

66
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:20,405
Isn't it nice to wonder?

67
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:23,707
Yeah, it is.

68
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:41,991
What do we do now?

69
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:45,527
Run!

70
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,599
What are you doing?

71
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,784
You keep going, I'll try to slow them down.

72
00:04:08,785 --> 00:04:09,901
What?!

73
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:11,019
They're my people,
they're not gonna hurt me.

74
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,687
I'll contact you as soon as it's safe.

75
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:13,953
You better.

76
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,622
Oh, shit!

77
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,560
Woah, hey, hey!

78
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:23,627
<i>Tonkin, out of my way.</i>

79
00:04:23,628 --> 00:04:24,527
Hey, guys.

80
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:25,793
<i>Weaver take point.</i>

81
00:04:30,398 --> 00:04:32,430
<i>Rollins flank while
Vasquez provides cover!</i>

82
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:36,767
<i>Zorin, status?</i>

83
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:37,900
<i>I've got our six.</i>

84
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:48,209
<i>Track has gone,  I've lost the signal.</i>

85
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,392
<i>Target is back.</i>

86
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,575
<i>10 seconds, I've got  inbound police.</i>

87
00:05:58,576 --> 00:05:59,608
<i>Close the net.</i>

88
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,779
Oh, shit.

89
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:12,244
Officer Cameron.

90
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:13,078
Where am I?

91
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,614
You're in CPS Med Bay Nine.

92
00:07:16,615 --> 00:07:18,115
What's the day?

93
00:07:18,116 --> 00:07:19,982
September 25th.

94
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:24,286
The year?

95
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:27,322
2080.

96
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:30,123
Have Officer Cameron's
family notified she's awake.

97
00:07:33,594 --> 00:07:34,427
Family?

98
00:07:34,428 --> 00:07:36,295
You've been asleep for three years.

99
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:38,362
Welcome back, Kiera.

100
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:12,821
<b>sync and corrections by Caio
www.addic7ed.com</b>

101
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,570
I don't remember anything.

102
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,538
You were admitted with
dozens who were injured

103
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,708
in the execution chamber explosion.

104
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,976
The terrorist attack?

105
00:08:32,977 --> 00:08:34,510
Liber8?

106
00:08:34,511 --> 00:08:35,844
It doesn't matter.

107
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:38,146
We initiated a controlled
coma so that we could operate

108
00:08:38,147 --> 00:08:40,748
and spare you some of
the recovery discomfort

109
00:08:40,749 --> 00:08:43,250
but for some reason we
couldn't wake you up.

110
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:44,684
We knew it was just a matter of time

111
00:08:44,685 --> 00:08:46,851
before you came back to us.

112
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:55,993
Is there something you want to tell me?

113
00:08:55,994 --> 00:09:01,898
I had these vivid experiences,
as real as anything.

114
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:02,932
More than a dream.

115
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:04,533
I...

116
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:07,002
I can remember all of it.

117
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:08,570
I understand.

118
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:10,838
It makes perfect sense.

119
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:12,789
You see, your CMR

120
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,741
was designed to activate
realistic simulation program

121
00:09:14,742 --> 00:09:17,910
when brain trauma has been detected.

122
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:19,378
Mom?

123
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:20,510
Sam?

124
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:29,052
Oh... Oh.

125
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:30,620
I missed you so much.

126
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:32,822
I missed you, too.

127
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,557
You have some catching up to do.

128
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:36,291
I'll be right outside.

129
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:40,896
Look at you.

130
00:09:40,897 --> 00:09:41,830
Look at you.

131
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,898
I can't believe it's you.

132
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:45,766
I'm scared to touch you.

133
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,901
I can't believe you're back.

134
00:09:47,902 --> 00:09:51,570
I'm so sorry I left, I didn't
want to, I didn't mean to.

135
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:55,106
It's not your fault.

136
00:09:55,107 --> 00:09:57,141
I missed you.

137
00:09:57,142 --> 00:10:00,644
I missed you every day.

138
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:03,480
I should have been there for you and...

139
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:04,714
and I wasn't.

140
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:06,315
It's ok.

141
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:09,085
Everything is ok.

142
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:11,053
It's not ok.

143
00:10:11,054 --> 00:10:12,920
It's not ok. Look at you!

144
00:10:16,558 --> 00:10:18,791
This emotional stress
is becoming a concern.

145
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:26,532
What are you doing here?

146
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,299
I'm here to calm you down.

147
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:38,008
Kiera, I'm so pleased to see you back.

148
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:40,443
You've done an excellent job.

149
00:10:40,444 --> 00:10:43,279
You've changed the past.

150
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,380
You saved the future.

151
00:10:44,381 --> 00:10:45,481
Mom?

152
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:46,482
Sam?

153
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:47,115
Sam!

154
00:10:47,116 --> 00:10:47,748
Kiera?

155
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:48,515
Kiera?

156
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:49,382
Kiera, are you ok?

157
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:50,216
Kiera!

158
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:50,916
Sam!

159
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:51,583
Sam!

160
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:52,183
Are you ok?

161
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:52,883
It's Alec.

162
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:53,717
Sam!

163
00:10:53,718 --> 00:10:54,584
It's Carlos and Alec.

164
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:56,319
Come on.

165
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,354
No, no, no.

166
00:10:58,355 --> 00:10:59,922
He was just...
he was just here.

167
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:01,723
You're fine, you're safe, you're alive.

168
00:11:01,724 --> 00:11:03,357
I'm ok, I'm ok.

169
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:05,726
Kiera, you are hallucinating.

170
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:10,762
My CMR goes into simulation
mode in the event of head trauma.

171
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:13,865
Come on.

172
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:16,132
I'm ok, I'm ok.

173
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,269
We've got it from here, thanks.

174
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:26,375
What the hell happened?

175
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:28,208
I don't know.

176
00:11:31,112 --> 00:11:33,379
What did happen?

177
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,682
All I know is patrol came
across some heavily armed perps.

178
00:11:36,683 --> 00:11:38,850
They snuck their way out of
the area and they escaped.

179
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:40,184
We're trying to get a location on them

180
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:44,120
but we're a little short on details.

181
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,654
Ok.

182
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:47,155
Get her out of here,
take her some place safe.

183
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:49,490
Sure thing.

184
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:51,123
I want you in my office
first thing tomorrow.

185
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:11,008
Marcellus?

186
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:12,042
Tonkin.

187
00:12:12,043 --> 00:12:13,776
You look surprised to see me.

188
00:12:15,012 --> 00:12:17,747
I didn't expect to see
you pulling this duty.

189
00:12:17,748 --> 00:12:21,717
After you left, things got worse.

190
00:12:21,718 --> 00:12:23,250
We moved everything up.

191
00:12:25,754 --> 00:12:28,889
Rollins, Nolan.

192
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,258
You know Vasquez.

193
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:33,860
Weaver, and Zorin.

194
00:12:33,861 --> 00:12:37,529
What happened with your aim?

195
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,747
What do you mean?

196
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:41,966
Your mission was locate
timers and neutralize them.

197
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:43,701
Things got complicated.

198
00:12:43,702 --> 00:12:45,402
Hmm.

199
00:12:45,403 --> 00:12:47,537
I saw you with her, Brad.

200
00:12:47,538 --> 00:12:49,038
Cameron.

201
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,540
She's on the target list.

202
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,173
What were you doing with her?

203
00:13:09,525 --> 00:13:11,125
Nice place.

204
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:12,126
Who's is it?

205
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:15,362
It's mine, apparently.

206
00:13:15,363 --> 00:13:16,763
Right.

207
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:19,165
The other me, dead me,

208
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,600
grabbed the brass ring with both hands.

209
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:24,536
Paid in cash.

210
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,338
Alec?

211
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,973
We need to talk.

212
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:31,540
Ok.

213
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:40,215
I came to a realization.

214
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:42,584
What's that?

215
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:45,386
I accomplished my mission.

216
00:13:45,387 --> 00:13:47,388
Stopped Liber8,

217
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:50,858
prevented whatever future
they might have built,

218
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:55,295
and I made sure you will
never build the broken future

219
00:13:55,296 --> 00:13:57,297
that I came from.

220
00:13:57,298 --> 00:14:01,000
That was the reason for
sending me back, wasn't it?

221
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:04,003
Apparently.

222
00:14:04,004 --> 00:14:07,206
It's time for me to focus on myself.

223
00:14:07,207 --> 00:14:10,275
What I want.

224
00:14:10,276 --> 00:14:15,379
What exactly are you talking about, Kiera?

225
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,881
Longing.

226
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:20,984
Desire.

227
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,552
It caught me a little by surprise.

228
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:31,759
I want to go home, Alec.

229
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,193
And I need you to send me.

230
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,907
What are you schemers scheming?

231
00:14:47,908 --> 00:14:49,041
Revenge.

232
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:50,508
Payback.

233
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,814
Uh, she doesn't know.

234
00:14:55,815 --> 00:14:57,816
What don't I know?

235
00:14:57,817 --> 00:15:01,653
After you left me at Piron,
Kellogg played his ace card.

236
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:05,423
I got the boot and he's taken control.

237
00:15:05,424 --> 00:15:07,091
I'm trying to get my company back.

238
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:09,960
Alec has a plan to make Kellogg pay.

239
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:11,761
And make it hurt.

240
00:15:11,762 --> 00:15:14,997
It's the hurting part that concerns me.

241
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,199
How's that coming?

242
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,301
We've hit a few road blocks.

243
00:15:19,302 --> 00:15:22,003
It's nothing I can't handle.

244
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,972
What about our conversation last night?

245
00:15:24,973 --> 00:15:27,374
That's exactly what I'm doing.

246
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,875
How do you figure?

247
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:31,244
In order to get you-

248
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:32,878
where you need to go,

249
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,714
I need very specialized technology.

250
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:37,182
The one person who currently possesses

251
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:40,585
that very rare technology to
get you back to your future is-

252
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:42,687
Kellogg.

253
00:15:42,688 --> 00:15:44,320
Kellogg.

254
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:55,698
Mr. Kellogg?

255
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:58,299
Curtis Chen is here for you.

256
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:07,074
Thank you, Jacqueline.

257
00:16:08,644 --> 00:16:11,012
You're doing well.

258
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,280
It's not by accident.

259
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:16,449
What can I do for you, Curtis?

260
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,517
It's what I can do for you, Kellogg.

261
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:20,185
Is this about my future?

262
00:16:20,186 --> 00:16:21,586
It always is.

263
00:16:21,587 --> 00:16:23,320
Ok, look.

264
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:25,056
Before you spellbind me
with some hokey temporal

265
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:27,024
religious nonsense,

266
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:30,761
let me cut to the chase.

267
00:16:30,762 --> 00:16:33,897
Right now I don't really see
the advantage of aligning myself

268
00:16:33,898 --> 00:16:37,200
with you and your friend.

269
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:40,403
I'm not saying it's not a
possibility... eventually,

270
00:16:40,404 --> 00:16:44,539
I just need to get the lay
of the land first, you know?

271
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,908
Before I make any important decisions.

272
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:49,710
How will you know?

273
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:50,677
Excuse me?

274
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:54,614
If they're important, the decisions.

275
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:56,449
See, that's where I come in.

276
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,651
I can let you know in advance
which decisions are key

277
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:02,021
to protecting your future
and which decisions are not.

278
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,756
Think of the traveler as a road map.

279
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:04,490
Hmm.

280
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:07,392
A map to this grim future

281
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:11,695
where I'm some warlord leading an army.

282
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:13,363
Not the future.

283
00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:15,298
Right now.

284
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:19,268
Your foot soldiers are here in this time.

285
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:21,637
I can help you use them,

286
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:23,438
push their actions.

287
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,374
Push the timeline in the right direction.

288
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,043
The right way.

289
00:17:29,044 --> 00:17:30,444
I'm still gonna think about it.

290
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:32,512
It's your prerogative, of course.

291
00:17:32,513 --> 00:17:33,980
But one way or another,

292
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:37,249
your destiny will catch up with you

293
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,584
and bring you back to me.

294
00:17:39,585 --> 00:17:41,586
To us.

295
00:17:41,587 --> 00:17:44,386
Then I have something to look forward to.

296
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,556
Now if you'll excuse me,

297
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:51,626
I've got some business to attend to.

298
00:17:51,627 --> 00:17:53,760
Of course.

299
00:18:04,472 --> 00:18:05,939
Interesting night.

300
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,507
Uh, yeah.

301
00:18:07,508 --> 00:18:08,841
You could say that.

302
00:18:08,842 --> 00:18:11,743
Between the power outage
and street warfare,

303
00:18:11,744 --> 00:18:13,911
I'm guessing more Liber8 activity.

304
00:18:13,912 --> 00:18:15,879
I'm worried it's a new faction.

305
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,146
Based on what?

306
00:18:17,147 --> 00:18:19,081
Solid intel.

307
00:18:19,082 --> 00:18:21,783
Provided by Kiera Cameron?

308
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:25,352
There's CCTV security footage
of her with members of Liber8.

309
00:18:25,353 --> 00:18:26,586
Working with them.

310
00:18:26,587 --> 00:18:27,787
Uh huh.

311
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:29,321
Kiera's managed to infiltrate Liber8.

312
00:18:29,322 --> 00:18:30,822
She's gathering intel that should lead to

313
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:32,990
some high-profile arrests.

314
00:18:32,991 --> 00:18:34,624
That's quite the promise.

315
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,226
More of a hopeful prediction.

316
00:18:36,227 --> 00:18:37,360
I want results.

317
00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:38,828
Not predictions.

318
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:39,728
Copy that.

319
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:42,464
Oh, did you hear about Dillon?

320
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:43,298
What?

321
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:44,332
Doctors cleared him.

322
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,466
He'll be out any day.

323
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:48,035
I can go back to being a detective.

324
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:51,171
I wouldn't throw away
that sport coat just yet.

325
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,872
Word on the street is
he's done with the force.

326
00:18:58,811 --> 00:19:00,344
Jesus Christ.

327
00:19:00,345 --> 00:19:02,512
I never took you for a religious man.

328
00:19:02,513 --> 00:19:05,681
Do you realize the
position that you put me in?

329
00:19:05,682 --> 00:19:08,050
I promise this is the last time

330
00:19:08,051 --> 00:19:10,919
you'll ever have to cover for me.

331
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,653
What are you talking about?

332
00:19:13,922 --> 00:19:15,555
Nothing.

333
00:19:15,556 --> 00:19:17,523
I just want to protect
you and the department

334
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,558
in any way that I can.

335
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,294
I've caused enough damage.

336
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:24,696
Literally and figuratively.

337
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,731
Are you ok?

338
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,766
Yes.

339
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,068
Ok.

340
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,170
So why don't you tell me
what happened last night?

341
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:38,074
Brad wanted to see if we had
prevented Kellogg's dark future.

342
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:41,043
Unfortunately, proof
that we failed showed up

343
00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:44,346
in the form of six
heavily armoured soldiers.

344
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:46,281
And where are they now?

345
00:19:46,282 --> 00:19:48,649
I don't know.

346
00:19:49,652 --> 00:19:51,085
And Brad?

347
00:19:51,086 --> 00:19:53,687
I haven't seen him since last night.

348
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:56,790
I'm hoping that he might
be working them from inside.

349
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,423
Might be?

350
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:01,525
I'm worried.

351
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,964
Alright, we gotta figure
out where these soldiers are

352
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:08,598
and what they're planning.

353
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,766
Target Kellogg.

354
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:12,634
They're connected to him
and whatever he's cooking up

355
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:14,736
in that twisted mind of his.

356
00:20:14,737 --> 00:20:18,405
Kellogg, as in my new overlord?

357
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:19,439
Same guy.

358
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,541
It's not gonna be as easy as it sounds.

359
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:23,476
Kellogg has consolidated
a lot of power and money,

360
00:20:23,477 --> 00:20:24,643
and his influence in this department

361
00:20:24,644 --> 00:20:26,511
shouldn't be underestimated.

362
00:20:26,512 --> 00:20:28,479
Piron still holds the
purse strings around here.

363
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,948
I'm sure you can find a way around that.

364
00:20:30,949 --> 00:20:32,149
Well, I'm still a cop, Kiera.

365
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,650
I've got to follow the rules.

366
00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:34,917
But you could get me something concrete

367
00:20:34,918 --> 00:20:36,785
that I can arrest Kellogg on

368
00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:38,686
and we could share the load.

369
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:40,287
Partner.

370
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:41,388
Ok.

371
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:44,791
I will work on nailing his ass,

372
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:48,494
but it might be fun to
shake the tree first.

373
00:20:48,495 --> 00:20:50,661
And what did you have in mind?

374
00:21:13,352 --> 00:21:15,886
So which one are you?

375
00:21:15,887 --> 00:21:17,954
The good one.

376
00:21:17,955 --> 00:21:21,556
I think you'd both say that.

377
00:21:22,058 --> 00:21:23,690
I'm the only one.

378
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:29,496
Then how good are you?

379
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,464
How much do you know?

380
00:21:31,465 --> 00:21:34,333
Sonya told me a little bit.

381
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,501
Brought some other things together.

382
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:38,869
Your future, mine.

383
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:45,842
Who are those guys?

384
00:21:45,843 --> 00:21:47,710
Political activist friends.

385
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:49,011
They look serious.

386
00:21:49,012 --> 00:21:51,113
They are serious.

387
00:21:51,114 --> 00:21:52,747
About making change.

388
00:21:52,748 --> 00:21:54,415
Outsmart your enemy.

389
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,049
Don't make yourself a target.

390
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,186
Embed, disrupt from the inside.

391
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:01,787
This is serendipitous.

392
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,653
That's what I came to talk to you about.

393
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:09,426
I'm listening.

394
00:22:09,427 --> 00:22:12,429
Do you still have your
employee access card to Piron.

395
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,297
They haven't fired me yet.

396
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:15,398
Yet.

397
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:18,100
That's good.

398
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:21,103
Maybe that change that
you're talking about,

399
00:22:21,104 --> 00:22:23,404
maybe we can make it together.

400
00:22:30,012 --> 00:22:31,478
Laying low?

401
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:36,950
The protector might be
our friend for the moment,

402
00:22:36,951 --> 00:22:37,951
but she still works for a system

403
00:22:37,952 --> 00:22:40,520
that wants to bring us down, Lucas.

404
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:43,454
We have to start thinking
about survival and disappearing.

405
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:47,491
You have an update?

406
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:51,428
Yeah, but uh... you're not gonna like it.

407
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:54,097
It seems like all that
effort we put into switching

408
00:22:54,098 --> 00:22:58,167
Alec Sadlers at the Halo
launch event was for nothing.

409
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,701
Kellogg's pulled a fast one

410
00:22:59,702 --> 00:23:03,271
and arranged to have the
kid removed from his company.

411
00:23:03,272 --> 00:23:05,806
He's holding all the cards now.

412
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:08,408
Kellogg controlling Piron.

413
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:12,344
That can't be good for us.

414
00:23:12,345 --> 00:23:13,311
I'll tell Travis.

415
00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:14,612
<i>There's more.</i>

416
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:15,746
There's some kind of temporal event

417
00:23:15,747 --> 00:23:18,081
connected to Kellogg's future.

418
00:23:18,082 --> 00:23:20,049
What's the protector doing about it?

419
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,750
It's unclear.

420
00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:23,952
Why is that?

421
00:23:23,953 --> 00:23:26,554
Kiera is protecting Brad.

422
00:23:26,555 --> 00:23:29,957
They're his people.

423
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,691
Then we can't trust her.

424
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,533
Are you sure you thought this through?

425
00:23:40,534 --> 00:23:41,900
Completely.

426
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:54,912
So finally I say to the guy

427
00:23:54,913 --> 00:23:57,781
"if I can't land a helicopter on it,

428
00:23:57,782 --> 00:23:59,449
"what's the point of buying it?"

429
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,167
Excuse me, ma'am, this is a private party.

430
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:19,134
Invited guests only.

431
00:24:19,135 --> 00:24:21,535
Aaaegh!

432
00:24:24,973 --> 00:24:26,639
That never gets old.

433
00:24:31,578 --> 00:24:32,611
Um, excuse me.

434
00:24:32,612 --> 00:24:34,544
This won't take a minute.

435
00:24:37,448 --> 00:24:39,081
Carlos!

436
00:24:39,082 --> 00:24:40,565
What a surprise,

437
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:42,050
I don't remember your
name on the guest list.

438
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:44,919
Yours, however, is
always on the guest list.

439
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,520
I'm flattered.

440
00:24:46,521 --> 00:24:48,054
I'm here on business, Kellogg.

441
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:49,421
Oh.

442
00:24:49,422 --> 00:24:50,790
Why don't you tell us
what happened with Alec.

443
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:51,924
Which one are you referring to?

444
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:53,292
Don't be a dick.

445
00:24:53,293 --> 00:24:54,993
What are you up to?

446
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,861
Business.

447
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,964
Just like Carlos.

448
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,699
Look, from where I was standing,

449
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,734
the other Alec was a problem.

450
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,869
He was a shithead, to be frank.

451
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,503
You knew it, I knew it.

452
00:25:07,504 --> 00:25:09,171
I just took care of the situation

453
00:25:09,172 --> 00:25:11,773
in my own creative way.

454
00:25:11,774 --> 00:25:13,924
Fine.

455
00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:16,077
Then give the Piron keys back
to the Alec who isn't a problem.

456
00:25:16,078 --> 00:25:20,014
I'd love to, but the board
doesn't know what we know

457
00:25:20,015 --> 00:25:21,415
and it might be a hard sell to them

458
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:24,684
with the whole time travel
doubles thing, you know.

459
00:25:24,685 --> 00:25:26,919
Paradoxically speaking.

460
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,353
Why don't you tell us about these soldiers

461
00:25:28,354 --> 00:25:30,121
from Brad's future?

462
00:25:30,122 --> 00:25:33,224
I'm sorry, your future.

463
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:34,625
Sorry, come again?

464
00:25:34,626 --> 00:25:36,893
In English, please?

465
00:25:36,894 --> 00:25:39,128
Power suits, heavy weapons,

466
00:25:39,129 --> 00:25:43,198
warlord Kellogg future scenario?

467
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:45,533
Brad spelled it out for us.

468
00:25:45,534 --> 00:25:48,102
Maybe he's the one you
should be talking to.

469
00:25:48,103 --> 00:25:49,937
Your boyfriend.

470
00:25:49,938 --> 00:25:53,172
Perhaps you should start
your investigation there.

471
00:25:54,675 --> 00:25:56,574
Let's go, Kiera.

472
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:07,284
Oh, yeah!

473
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,319
In your face, Kellogg.

474
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:18,860
<i>...Shut it down.</i>

475
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:22,396
It's an outside DNS attack,
our entire network shut down.

476
00:26:22,397 --> 00:26:24,096
Well, get it back up.

477
00:26:26,533 --> 00:26:28,267
Everything alright, Matthew?

478
00:26:28,268 --> 00:26:30,535
You know it's not, you're
obviously behind it.

479
00:26:30,536 --> 00:26:34,437
We have nothing to do with
whatever is going on right now.

480
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:36,138
Is somebody mad at you, Kellogg?

481
00:26:36,139 --> 00:26:38,174
Whoever just hacked into this company

482
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:41,076
is breaking the law, Carlos.

483
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:43,478
Why don't you do your job?

484
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:44,512
You know what?

485
00:26:44,513 --> 00:26:45,579
You're right. I'm sorry.

486
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,480
I'll get to the bottom of this.

487
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,748
In fact, I know the perfect
guy that can help us track down

488
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:53,251
the perpetrators of this heinous act.

489
00:26:53,252 --> 00:26:55,252
And he's a whiz with computers.

490
00:27:06,297 --> 00:27:07,063
What just happened?

491
00:27:07,064 --> 00:27:08,464
I have no idea.

492
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:11,233
Kellogg is up to something and
I have a feeling those soldiers

493
00:27:11,234 --> 00:27:13,268
are just the tip of the ice berg.

494
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:15,503
Yeah, no doubt about that.

495
00:27:15,504 --> 00:27:17,738
Look, if Brad is embedded with these guys

496
00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:20,440
and I'm not judging,

497
00:27:20,441 --> 00:27:23,109
I'm just saying, if you have questions

498
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,210
maybe you should press him for answers.

499
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,553
It's gotta be Kellogg.

500
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:37,788
Put him on speaker.

501
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:44,761
Alec Sadler.

502
00:27:44,762 --> 00:27:46,062
Is Julian there?

503
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:48,264
He is, and you're on speaker phone.

504
00:27:48,265 --> 00:27:49,932
You're fired, Julian.

505
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:52,100
You can't fire me, I already quit.

506
00:27:52,101 --> 00:27:53,468
<i>However you like.</i>

507
00:27:53,469 --> 00:27:56,771
Alec, I know you're behind this hack.

508
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:58,472
<i>Fix it.</i>

509
00:27:58,473 --> 00:28:00,273
Right now.

510
00:28:00,274 --> 00:28:02,308
Or I take this to Defcon 1.

511
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:04,576
You already did that
when you stole my company.

512
00:28:04,577 --> 00:28:06,978
Ok.

513
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:09,746
Are you ready to play big
league hard ball with me, kid?

514
00:28:15,953 --> 00:28:17,552
Bring it.

515
00:28:23,227 --> 00:28:24,893
And CMR is connected.

516
00:28:29,265 --> 00:28:30,764
Just like old times.

517
00:28:32,968 --> 00:28:34,768
You miss the barn?

518
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:36,801
Every day.

519
00:28:39,138 --> 00:28:41,372
Alec, before we get to work,

520
00:28:41,373 --> 00:28:44,508
I need to know what you did to Kellogg.

521
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:46,042
Nothing too harsh.

522
00:28:46,043 --> 00:28:49,545
Alec, what did you do?

523
00:28:49,546 --> 00:28:51,246
I sort of locked him out of his own system

524
00:28:51,247 --> 00:28:53,181
and then downloaded and erased all the data

525
00:28:53,182 --> 00:28:56,083
and control software for Piron's equipment.

526
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:58,351
You're asking for trouble.

527
00:28:58,352 --> 00:29:01,287
Actually, I'm trying to send you home.

528
00:29:01,288 --> 00:29:02,588
What do you mean?

529
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:04,823
All of Piron's anti-matter
time travel research

530
00:29:04,824 --> 00:29:07,292
is in the data that I stole.

531
00:29:07,293 --> 00:29:08,826
I thought we could use the
time to figure out a way

532
00:29:08,827 --> 00:29:14,797
to exploit the company's tech
and eventually send you home.

533
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:16,765
Thank you.

534
00:29:16,766 --> 00:29:18,032
That's inspired.

535
00:29:18,033 --> 00:29:19,600
Kellogg's going to be so
focused getting his business

536
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:21,001
back up and running he won't
even have time to realize

537
00:29:21,002 --> 00:29:22,502
what we're really up to.

538
00:29:22,503 --> 00:29:25,104
Good.

539
00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:27,673
While you're working on that,

540
00:29:27,674 --> 00:29:31,009
I'd also like you to help me
find Brad and the soldiers.

541
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,076
I thought you were staying out of it.

542
00:29:32,077 --> 00:29:34,778
It's just for my own peace of mind.

543
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:37,814
If he's in tight with them, I'll back off.

544
00:29:37,815 --> 00:29:38,714
But if he's in trouble...

545
00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:40,348
I understand.

546
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:41,382
Can you do it?

547
00:29:41,383 --> 00:29:43,350
Maybe.

548
00:29:43,351 --> 00:29:45,385
Their gear is probably
operating on some advanced tech.

549
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:47,887
Odd wavelength stuff.

550
00:29:47,888 --> 00:29:49,721
I could do a sweep of the spectrum,

551
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:51,557
see if there's any areas
with unique energy signatures.

552
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:52,691
It won't give you an exact address,

553
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:55,026
but I can narrow it down
to a few city blocks.

554
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:56,560
You could go down there
using your super suit

555
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,694
as a kind of antenna.

556
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,195
I could give you a specific building.

557
00:29:59,196 --> 00:30:01,430
Alright, good enough.

558
00:30:01,431 --> 00:30:03,431
Let's get started.

559
00:30:28,357 --> 00:30:30,024
You're breaking down the power suits,

560
00:30:30,025 --> 00:30:32,126
cannibalizing the core components.

561
00:30:32,127 --> 00:30:35,028
Something like that.

562
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:36,661
What exactly are you building?

563
00:30:39,432 --> 00:30:40,598
This mission is a
need-to-know basis,

564
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:43,267
and you don't need to know.

565
00:30:43,268 --> 00:30:44,935
Nolan?

566
00:30:44,936 --> 00:30:46,519
Give it time.

567
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,104
Marcellus has a lot on his plate and you-

568
00:30:48,105 --> 00:30:49,572
What about me?

569
00:30:49,573 --> 00:30:51,472
You can't see what we can.

570
00:30:56,912 --> 00:30:59,280
Alright, take a left.

571
00:30:59,281 --> 00:31:01,682
Try the end of the block.

572
00:31:01,683 --> 00:31:03,316
How long is this gonna take?

573
00:31:03,317 --> 00:31:05,518
Depends on how fast you go.

574
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,852
I take it back.

575
00:31:06,853 --> 00:31:08,887
I don't miss this.

576
00:31:08,888 --> 00:31:10,554
Your CMR says you're lying.

577
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:13,089
Great.

578
00:31:17,061 --> 00:31:18,428
Shit.

579
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:19,629
Are you following me?

580
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,763
No.

581
00:31:20,764 --> 00:31:24,199
It's a total coincidence.

582
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,367
What are you doing, Kiera?

583
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:27,867
Boyfriend issues?

584
00:31:28,903 --> 00:31:29,969
Something like that.

585
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:33,805
Kellogg's soldiers are
a problem for all of us.

586
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:35,740
You don't get to call the shots.

587
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:37,341
Give me a head start.

588
00:31:37,342 --> 00:31:39,276
I'll clear Brad from the
area, you can roll in,

589
00:31:39,277 --> 00:31:42,178
back me up and do your thing.

590
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:43,445
Woah, the signal just spiked.

591
00:31:43,446 --> 00:31:44,612
You're getting close.

592
00:31:44,613 --> 00:31:46,280
Alec says we're close.

593
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:47,764
Are you gonna help me out

594
00:31:47,765 --> 00:31:49,249
or am I gonna shut this
whole thing down right now?

595
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,866
<i>Got it.</i>

596
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,485
<i>It's the building to your left,  Kiera.</i>

597
00:31:52,486 --> 00:31:54,954
This is it.

598
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:58,123
Hey, head start, remember?

599
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,791
I changed my mind.

600
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,159
Listen to me:

601
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,427
I have seen these men in action.

602
00:32:03,428 --> 00:32:05,695
You need to have the upper hand,

603
00:32:05,696 --> 00:32:07,361
and right now you don't.

604
00:32:09,365 --> 00:32:11,466
I can play nice.

605
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:13,267
You got ten minutes.

606
00:32:13,268 --> 00:32:14,934
Perfect.

607
00:32:16,304 --> 00:32:18,271
Are you seriously gonna
let Garza try anything?

608
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:19,071
No.

609
00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:20,739
Get Carlos on speed dial.

610
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:25,443
I want him ready to roll, no matter what.

611
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,776
Gotcha.

612
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:55,938
Why take the chance?

613
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:57,172
It's not that simple.

614
00:32:57,173 --> 00:32:59,174
We served together.

615
00:32:59,175 --> 00:33:01,409
You don't win wars with
sentimentality, Marcellus.

616
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,477
No, you don't.

617
00:33:03,478 --> 00:33:06,112
You win them with recon and support.

618
00:33:06,113 --> 00:33:08,380
Tonkin arranged this place,
our supplies, and our comm.

619
00:33:08,381 --> 00:33:10,013
He's delivered.

620
00:33:16,354 --> 00:33:17,587
It's my call.

621
00:33:17,588 --> 00:33:19,854
We'll see how it plays out.

622
00:33:24,192 --> 00:33:27,127
<i>That is definitely  not from now.</i>

623
00:33:27,128 --> 00:33:30,597
<i>I'm recording all this, Kiera.</i>

624
00:33:30,598 --> 00:33:32,031
You ever see anything
like that in your time?

625
00:33:32,032 --> 00:33:34,700
No, that's a new one.

626
00:33:34,701 --> 00:33:37,636
It's like time travel team six.

627
00:33:37,637 --> 00:33:39,804
We have 11 days max
before the core degrades.

628
00:33:39,805 --> 00:33:40,771
If we're gonna have a fight

629
00:33:40,772 --> 00:33:42,704
we're gonna need more medical supplies.

630
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:45,990
<i>Crew is on edge.</i>

631
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:47,375
<i>It's their problem, not yours?</i>

632
00:33:47,376 --> 00:33:49,744
Marcellus, I don't know half of these guys.

633
00:33:49,745 --> 00:33:52,012
<i>You know we can't do this  without you.</i>

634
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:54,381
Looks like he's convinced
them he's one of them.

635
00:33:54,382 --> 00:33:56,749
It'll be nice having someone
on the inside feeding us info.

636
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:00,552
Woah, woah, what is that?

637
00:34:00,553 --> 00:34:01,786
It's cool.

638
00:34:01,787 --> 00:34:04,220
Can you grab me that, it looks like a pen?

639
00:34:12,163 --> 00:34:13,428
Watch her, Kiera.

640
00:34:22,004 --> 00:34:24,005
What's she doing?

641
00:34:24,006 --> 00:34:24,671
Get her out of there.

642
00:34:24,672 --> 00:34:25,339
Get her out of there.

643
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,106
Kiera, Brad is safe.

644
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:27,306
You need to leave.

645
00:35:13,746 --> 00:35:14,277
Got her!

646
00:35:20,149 --> 00:35:21,282
Nice shot.

647
00:35:21,283 --> 00:35:22,316
Bite me.

648
00:35:22,317 --> 00:35:25,319
Watch our backs, there
could be more of them.

649
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,487
Alec, get me out of here.

650
00:35:27,488 --> 00:35:28,587
Now!

651
00:35:34,961 --> 00:35:36,695
Alec, Alec, I'm burned.

652
00:35:36,696 --> 00:35:37,996
I need a way out, now!

653
00:35:37,997 --> 00:35:39,830
Ok, hang on, hang on,
just give me a second!

654
00:35:54,677 --> 00:35:56,643
Now you're out.

655
00:36:15,862 --> 00:36:17,329
I know who you are.

656
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:18,797
That makes two of us.

657
00:36:18,798 --> 00:36:20,398
What are you doing here?

658
00:36:20,399 --> 00:36:21,532
I can ask you the same thing.

659
00:36:21,533 --> 00:36:25,435
You're not in a position
to be asking any questions.

660
00:36:25,436 --> 00:36:27,069
I'm a police officer,

661
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,336
and that man is a suspect

662
00:36:28,337 --> 00:36:30,905
in an investigation that I'm conducting.

663
00:36:30,906 --> 00:36:32,873
Now, I don't know what
you think you're doing here

664
00:36:32,874 --> 00:36:35,408
but I do know that you're
involved with Matthew Kellogg,

665
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:38,244
and so do the police.

666
00:36:38,245 --> 00:36:39,378
I'm calling Carlos.

667
00:36:39,379 --> 00:36:41,413
Don't!

668
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:43,715
What do you mean, "don't"?

669
00:36:43,716 --> 00:36:45,550
Don't trust him.

670
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:48,019
He might consider Kellogg an ally

671
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,620
but he's only interested in one thing.

672
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:51,387
Kellogg.

673
00:36:51,388 --> 00:36:53,156
This is a waste of our time.

674
00:36:53,157 --> 00:36:54,290
Toss her.

675
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:58,026
Marcellus, she could be useful.

676
00:36:58,027 --> 00:37:01,029
Useful?

677
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,462
What'd he tell you?

678
00:37:03,731 --> 00:37:05,598
Nothing.

679
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,433
He tried to kill me, and he failed.

680
00:37:12,004 --> 00:37:13,136
Apparently not.

681
00:37:33,888 --> 00:37:34,621
Let's go after them!

682
00:37:34,622 --> 00:37:36,122
Stand down!

683
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:37,389
We pack up and we move.

684
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,556
Agreed.

685
00:37:38,557 --> 00:37:40,790
This place will be crawling
with cops in no time.

686
00:37:54,204 --> 00:37:56,070
That was close.

687
00:37:56,872 --> 00:37:58,337
Too close!

688
00:38:00,741 --> 00:38:02,207
Have you seen Emily?

689
00:38:03,543 --> 00:38:04,675
Not for a while.

690
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:09,935
Get out!

691
00:39:09,936 --> 00:39:11,302
Now!

692
00:39:28,754 --> 00:39:30,721
Alright, keep me posted.

693
00:39:30,722 --> 00:39:33,590
Yeah.

694
00:39:33,591 --> 00:39:35,592
Alright.

695
00:39:35,593 --> 00:39:37,627
So SWAT cleared the building,

696
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:39,729
there's no sign of our new friends.

697
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,497
Surprise, surprise.

698
00:39:43,433 --> 00:39:45,267
What is it?

699
00:39:45,268 --> 00:39:48,336
I just feel like we've
been down this road before.

700
00:39:48,337 --> 00:39:52,073
It's Liber8 all over again.

701
00:39:52,074 --> 00:39:54,909
Well, this time we know
they're working for Kellogg

702
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,111
and we've got a man on the inside.

703
00:39:57,112 --> 00:39:59,512
If that's the case,

704
00:39:59,513 --> 00:40:01,914
why don't we have anybody in custody yet?

705
00:40:01,915 --> 00:40:04,750
Maybe Brad will reach out.

706
00:40:04,751 --> 00:40:07,551
We can't count on "maybe".

707
00:40:11,657 --> 00:40:15,459
You know, ever since you
got knocked out there's been,

708
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,295
I don't know, something different.

709
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:19,262
Sorry.

710
00:40:19,263 --> 00:40:22,632
I've been preoccupied.

711
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:24,900
Thoughts of 2077.

712
00:40:24,901 --> 00:40:26,635
Home.

713
00:40:26,636 --> 00:40:29,504
Sam.

714
00:40:29,505 --> 00:40:32,106
Of course.

715
00:40:32,107 --> 00:40:37,210
I need to believe that
path still exists for me.

716
00:40:37,211 --> 00:40:39,811
That I'll be able to see him again.

717
00:40:45,184 --> 00:40:47,652
Well, I support you going home.

718
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:51,788
I'm not happy about it, but I support you.

719
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:55,891
To going home.

720
00:41:08,004 --> 00:41:10,537
To going home.

721
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:24,150
You're late.

722
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:26,519
I had to be careful.

723
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,487
You said this was about
Kellogg and his new friends.

724
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:29,354
That's the only reason I'm here.

725
00:41:29,355 --> 00:41:30,455
So make it quick.

726
00:41:30,456 --> 00:41:31,956
I don't think any of us
can afford to let Kellogg

727
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:33,524
become more powerful.

728
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:35,859
More insulated, build and control an army

729
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,194
that shapes history his way.

730
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:39,528
What are you saying?

731
00:41:39,529 --> 00:41:41,963
I'm saying what's good for you and Liber8

732
00:41:41,964 --> 00:41:45,732
is most likely what's bad for Kellogg.

733
00:41:45,733 --> 00:41:47,967
You want us to take out Kellogg?

734
00:41:47,968 --> 00:41:49,301
To do your dirty work?

735
00:41:49,302 --> 00:41:51,219
No.

736
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,138
No, I think you've got plenty
of good reasons to kill Kellogg.
