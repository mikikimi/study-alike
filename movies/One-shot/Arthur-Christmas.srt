00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,250
<i>Dear Santa,
Are you real?</i>

2
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,390
<i>If you live at the North Pole,</i>

3
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,030
<i>how come I can't see your house
when I look on Google Earth?</i>

4
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,290
<i>Are you Saint Nicholas?</i>

5
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,840
<i>'Cause you'd be
incredibly old.</i>

6
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,680
<i>How do you have time
to read all the letters</i>

7
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,820
<i>from all the children in the world?</i>

8
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,360
<i>And how many cookies and
mince pies have you eaten</i>

9
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,360
<i>in all of history?</i>

10
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,670
<i>How do you get
all of the presents in the sack?</i>

11
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,450
<i>Does your sack have to get bigger</i>

12
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,230
<i>every year, 'cause of
exponential population growth?</i>

13
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,530
<i>And how do you
get down the chimneys?</i>

14
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,360
<i>I put my head in ours,
and it's really small,</i>

15
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,900
<i>even if you could
squeeze down in 1 minute.</i>

16
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,160
<i>And there's 9 houses in my village,
so that's nearly 10 minutes,</i>

17
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,880
<i>and there are
millions of loads in the world.</i>

18
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,900
<i>It must be so hard
being Santa these days.</i>

19
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,110
<i>I mean, what if,
after all of that,</i>

20
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,110
<i>I'm staying at Grandma's?</i>

21
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,970
<i>Santa, how can you get
'round the whole world</i>

22
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,180
<i>in just one night?</i>

23
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,200
<i>My friend said, that
you'd have to go so fast,</i>

24
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,530
<i>it would make you,
and the sleigh,</i>

25
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,190
<i>and the reindeer,
all burn up!</i>

26
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,320
<i>I think you are real,</i>

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,320
<i>but how do you do it?</i>

28
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,510
<i>For Christmas,</i>

29
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,500
<i>I would love a pink
twinkle-bike with stabilizers.</i>

30
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,920
<i>But, please, don't
bring it</i>

31
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,630
<i>if it makes you
and the reindeer burn.</i>

32
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,950
<i>Love,
Gwen Hines.</i>

<i>Your request for a pink</i>

<i>And, yes,</i>

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,300
<i>we do believe in Santa.</i>

42
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,570
<i>He is real.</i>

43
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,610
<i>He's the greatest man ever,</i>

44
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,340
<i>and he can get around
the world to every child</i>

<i>without a single reindeer
being roasted alive, or hurt.</i>

Ahem?

67
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,560
Oh!

68
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,640
Sorry. Ha ha.

Germany? Huh.

85
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,180
So many countries these days.

86
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,230
It's a big night, sir.

87
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,380
My, uh, 70th mission. Yes.

mince pies.

00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,730
So, you looking forward to it?
Retirement?

What happened to peace
and goodwill to all men, Sarge?

99
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,350
It don't say nothing
about elves, soldier.

What are you doing in here, Arthur?

111
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,610

112
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,090
- Oh, no! Maria!
- Whoops. Bye-bye, Maria.

113

No. Thanks.

Left out of the Oval Office,

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,860
Let's focus on the now.
Eh, Peter?

00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,640
Święty Mikołaj!

146
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,860
- Anyway...
- I guess he's harmless.

147
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,710
Oh, terribly sorry.
Is that your leg?

148
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,970
I'm really sorry, Steve.

149
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,590
It's my Christmas
slippers on the ice.

150
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,960
They're from China.

151
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,020
- Found it.
- What?

152
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,650
The letter. You know?
The one I said,

153
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,020
from Maria Costa.

154
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,990
She asked for a pocket puppy,

155
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,790
but she really wants the blue one,

156
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,600
'cause it looks like her
auntie's dog Biffo that ran away.

157
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,820
I remember, 'cause she
sent a picture of Biffo.

158
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,790
- See?
- Uh, child 3G7X...

159
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,160
- A...A...Arthur...
- This was Greece, sir!

160
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,580
Five countries ago, sir!

161
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,950
I just want it to be
perfect for every kid.

162
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,570
Hey! There's Dad!

163
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,100
Santa!
Maria Costa, Dad!

164
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,160
Did she get the blue one?

165
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,890
Little bro, it's great
to have you around.

166
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,220
You...You bring a...
a genuine aura...

167
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,860
...of seasonal positivity.

168
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,940
- Thank you.
- But could you...

169
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,850
...not be in Mission Control...

170
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,350
at all?

171
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,550
For the rest of the night.

172
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,500
- ...Yeah.
<i>- You're never gonna walk again.</i>

173
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,350
Ah, of course.

174
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,360
Right.

175
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,930
Sorry if I...uh...

176
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,930
Brilliant!

177
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,240
They should put him
somewhere out of harm's way.

178
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,890
What? Like the South Pole?

179
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,840
Waker!
We have a waker!

180
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,330
And Santa's in there!

181
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,470
<i>Code red. Repeat:</i>

182
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,210
<i>Code red.</i>

183
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,370
Santa?

184
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,370
Are you here?

185
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,000
[Toy "moo"s]

186
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
-  Steve...
- Hold on, father.

187
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,690
Intel. Get me intel!

188
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,360
Santa's head seems to be
resting on some sort of

189
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,630
- "Try Me" button, sir.

190
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,370
It's the "Quack Quack
Moo Activity Farm", sir.

191
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,840
It features 12
separate animal sounds,

192
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,090
and sings
"Old MacDonald Had a Farm".

193
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,760
The moment your father lifts his head,

194
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,980
there'll be 10 seconds
of constant "moo"ing.

195
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,730
<i>- Risk of "moo"ing:  98%</i>
- Captain Moreno.

196
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,730
You're going to have
to take the batteries out.

197
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,890
But he'll have to get past
the wrapping, the box,

198
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,340
and 14 twist-ties
anchoring it to the cardboard.

199
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,640
- It's too noisy!
- And you'll wake the boy!

200
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,720
He'll see Santa!

201
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,290
And, at 1816,

202
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,850
when Santa was seen,

203
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,360
they tracked him home.
He had to go into hiding.

204
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,760
No Christmas for six years!

205
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,970
The elves!
All alone!

206
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,640
<i>- The elves? Alone?
- What are we going to do?</i>

207
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,560
Calm down!
It's not 1816 now.

208
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,130
Moreno, your HOHO
is equipped with

209
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,040
state of the art EMF
sensor technology

210
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,790
hacked directly from the
military's missile program.

211
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,600
I want you to locate the batteries

212
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,450
and perform a level 3
gift-wrap incision.

213
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,670
Go in through the robin.

214
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,010
<i>Incising robin.</i>

215
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,540
Big girl's blouse.
Lot of fuss.

216
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,410
I did my 70 missions

217
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,130
without any of this malarkey!

218
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,220
Didn't we, lad?

219
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,880
<i>Twist-ties clear.</i>

220
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,120
Can I watch with you, Grand-Santa?

221
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,650
Shut the door!
Hell's ***,

222
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,650
- It's the North Pole!
- Is the kid still asleep?

223
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,970
He mustn't see Santa!

224
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,620
Dad would rather die
than spoil it for him.

225
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,620
What if you do
wake the old nipper?

226
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,470
A whack on the head
with a sock full of sand

227
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,850
and a dab of whiskey on the lips;

228
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,320
they don't remember
in the morning.

229
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,860
<i>- Screwdriver elf.</i>
- Yes!

230
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,030
What happened to going
down the chimney?

231
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,030
Never did me any--

232
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,030
Get off me!

233
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,430
Down, boy!
Basket!

234
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,800
Here you are,
Grand-Santa.

235
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,480
I made you a
nice mince pie.

236
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,940
I can't eat that.
It gets in me teeth.

237
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,040
Now, I've just got to
visit the elf hospital,

238
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,770
look over a treaty with Greenland,
and make the gravy.

239
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,300
Then we'll finally have the
whole family home for Christmas.

240
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,710
They're nearly done.

241
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,060
-
- Oh, no!

242
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,830
-
- It's the detachable milkmaid!

243
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,530
<i>She's got her own power source!</i>

244
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,970
They've got 5 seconds
'til she starts singing!

245
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,570
<i>Four!</i>

246
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,360
<i>Three!</i>

247
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,370
<i>Two!</i>

248
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,990
<i>One!</i>

249
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,030
Use your HOHO!

250
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,030
Exit Code 12.
Code 12!

251
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,500
Revise drop-time to
42.13 seconds.

252
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,050
Let's pick this up, people!

253
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,770
<i>Drop-time revised.</i>

254
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,770
<i>Picking this up.</i>

255
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,550
<i>3!...2!...1!...</i>

256
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,800
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

257
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,160
Oh, what a night that was!

258
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,340
<i>That detachable milkmaid!</i>

259
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,800
Just the beginning.
Right, sir?

260
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,790
I...got you a present, sir.

261
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,730
Not "S" for Steve, sir.

262
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,330
"S" for Santa!

263
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,530
Oh...I don't know about that, Peter.

264
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,990
Okay! Let's bring them home!

265
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,020
CCTV in every room!
I had to go under the floor!

266
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,940
Stand back!
Olly Injury coming through!

267
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,040
Hey! Fancy a trip
on the S-1, Arthur?

268
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,770
It only goes 150,000
miles per hour.

269
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,810
No, thanks. I see a bit of the
world from my office, you know.

270
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,630
Some of the stamps I get are amazing!

271
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,140
Dad! Dad!

272
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,920
Dad!
Oops. I'm sorry. So sorry.

273
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,660
- Dad! Dad!
- Santa's waving!

274
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,570
- He's waving at me!
- He's waving at me!

275
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,740
- Arthur.
- Happy Christmas!

276
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,740
You, too.

277
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,380
You were fantastic!

278
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,920
Look:  Christmas slippers!

279
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,180
Huh. Well done. Yes.

280
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,500
- Father?
- Ah! There he is!

281
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,960
Steve!

282
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,470
Mission:  Accomplished!

283
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,630
Tonight, we delivered
2 billion presents,

284
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,590
on this, my 70th mission!

285
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,980
Standby!

286
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,860
Oh, thank you.

287
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,890
You know, I sometimes think
I couldn't do it without you,

288
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,370
and my splendid Margaret,

289
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,620
who stood by me
all these years,

290
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,660
very ably doing all that, uh,

291
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,500
stuff that women do when
their husbands are at work.  Marvelous.

292
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,760
And, uh, Arthur. Yes.

293
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Doing vital work in maintenance.

294
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,460
- Really vital.
- I, um,

295
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,080
I work in letters, Dad.

296
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,750
Letters. Of course.
I'm so sorry.

297
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,590
You moved me after
I tripped over that plug

298
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,260
and melted down the elf barracks.

299
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,710
<i>I lost everything in that flood.</i>

300
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,250
Yes. Now...

301
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,020
Many years ago,

302
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,020
my father told me,

303
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,620
that being Santa

304
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,250
is the best job in the world.

305
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,250
He was right.

306
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,450
I loved it.

307
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:12,050
I can't wait for year seventy one!

308
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,130
Merry Christmas everyone!

309
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,110
What do you get
if you eat

310
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,480
Christmas decorations?

311
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,790
Tinsel-itis!

312
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,740
Isn't this the best
bit of Christmas?

313
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,170
It certainly is, Arthur.

314
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,170
The whole family together.

315
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,710
- How about a toast, Malcolm?
- Oh!

316
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,340
Uh, well ... here's to me ...

317
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,340
doing an even better job next year!

318
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,690
I mean, you're
already perfect, Dad.

319
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,430
Ha! That turkey did more than him.

320
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,900
You wouldn't understand, Father.

321
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,610
Eh, Steve?

322
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,000
Forget Techno Tommy.

323
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,410
He's texting on his
calculator after another job.

324
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,820
It's a <u>H</u>and-held <u>O</u>perational & <u>H</u>oming <u>O</u>rganizer:

325
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,700
the HOHO 3000.

326
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,170
- I'm enacting mission closure.
- Ooo. Whoopie doo.

327
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,270
Aren't you the Fancy Nancy?

328
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,850
Don't matter what
you come up with, son.

329
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,140
You may be the next in line,

330
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,580
but you'll never get to be
Santa unless you knock him off.

331
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,120
I've got you all a present.

332
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,430
After all the hard work,

333
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,500
I wanted everyone
to have some Christmas fun.

334
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,390
What is that?

335
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,760
- I'm Santa!
- No. I'm Santa.

336
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,780
This is ridiculous. You just took
the piece out of my hand!

337
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,440
Well, I am actually Santa,

338
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,400
so I rather think I should have it.

339
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,880
Well, yes. You're the
non-executive figurehead.

340
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,300
Exactly. The figurehead.

341
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,610
It means a fatty with a
beard and fits the suit.

342
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,320
The other pieces are good, too.

343
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,920
Or, I can make
extra Santa's for everyone.

344
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,630
Why don't you
be the candle, Steve?

345
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,580
All those bright ideas, eh?

346
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,050
Fine.  I'm the candle.

347
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,700
Arthur's the turkey.  And you,
Father, are, of course,

348
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,850
Santa.

349
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,480
Grand-Santa, you can be
this charming relic.

350
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,210
Relic? Relic?

351
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,860
I did the whole of
Christmas in one of these, Arthur!

352
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,500
Oh, yes. I didn't need a

353
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,870
trillion elves in blinking hats.

354
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,900
We don't just fly about throwing
lead-painted toys down chimneys any more.

355
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,250
- That space sends you back to Lapland.
- Why?

356
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,340
Malcolm, where did you get those?

357
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,020
Just moving things along.

358
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,630
- Do I win?
- Cheats! The pair of you!

359
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,860
- Mum, are you okay?
- Polar bear, dear.

360
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,450
Attacked me on the ice.

361
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,280
Good job I did
that online survival course,

362
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,490
Christmas has gone
right down the Rodney hole.

363
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,620
You're a postman with a spaceship!

364
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,720
My S-1 festivized the world

365
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,060
at 1,860 times the speed of sound!

366
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,060
Christmas, 1941.

367
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,900
World War II.

368
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,910
I did the whole thing with
six reindeer and a drunken elf!

369
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,570
I was shot at, Arthur.
Took twelve direct hits.

370
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,070
- Lost three reindeer.
- What happened to the elf?

371
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,960
Fell out of the sleigh over
Lake Geneva.  Never saw him again.

372
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,480
Goodness.  Now,

373
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,210
Christmas crackers.

374
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,510
Sing "Silent Night" backwards.

375
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,710
Who would know that?

376
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:01,650
♪ tneliS thgin! yloH thgin!
llA si mlac, lla si thgirb. ♪♪

377
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,310
I went on alone.

378
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,070
I could still do it now, Arthur.

379
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,740
- Just gimme a go!
- In a heap of sticks.

380
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,150
Heap of--
I'll show you,

381
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,820
Rumpy the robot!

382
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,640
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, my. That won't make--

383
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,640
- I would've won, anyway.
- What?

384
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,780
Oh, yeah! Run away,
now that you're losing!

385
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,710
Steve!

386
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,890
Steve! Don't be upset.

387
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,860
Look:  You keep this.

388
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,000
Then you can be Santa next time.

389
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
That'll be you there, Steve.

390
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,630
Next year, I bet.

391
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,890
You'll be great.

392
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,880
How many times, Arthur?

393
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,880
It's the North Pole.

394
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,270
Shut the doors!

395
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,900
I secured the gift, sir.
Gift secured.

396
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,480
It just can't be.
The system is foolproof.

397
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,580
- It has to be an error, sir.
- Error!?

398
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,060
I spotted the ribbon
glinting in the shadows, sir.

399
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,200
I am actually trained in wrapping.

400
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,830
But I say to myself, "Bryony,"

401
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,580
the wrapping looks okay.
Thank goodness!

402
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,580
- But that present should not be lying in the--
- Yes. Yes. Thank you, soldier.

403
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,320
Someone got the wrong present?
That's awful!

404
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,150
- Whose is it?
- No one gets the wrong present.

405
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:23,150
47785BXK...

406
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,560
Gift undelivered?!

407
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,560
They got ... nothing.

408
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,630
-
- A child's been missed.

409
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,850
Not necessarily.

410
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,850
A child's been missed!

411
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,730
Do you want to wake up
the whole North Pole?

412
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,320
Good idea.
A CHILD'S BEEN MISSED!!!!

413
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,820
Arthur!

414
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,150
Everything all right?

415
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,860
There's been ...
a glitch.

416
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,530
- We've missed a child!
- Really?

417
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,630
Dear, oh dear.
That's awful.

418
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,430
How did you let it happen, Steven?

419
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,240
How did I--

420
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,120
- I thought it was your mission.
- Oh, no, no.

421
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,040
- This is your department.
- What are we going to do?

422
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,450
We must...um...
We must...

423
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,710
What must we do, Steven?

424
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,380
There's...nothing to do.

425
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,670
The mission was a success.

426
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,140
We can't leave
a child out of Christmas.

427
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,180
Sunrise at destination is 7:39 A.M.

428
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,050
- There's no way to get there in time.
- No way.

429
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,050
- Except, of course, the S-1.
- The S-1.

430
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,300
- Righto.
- No!

431
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,240
The S-1 has just traveled
7 million miles.

432
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,250
- We could damage it!
- Oh, dear.

433
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,910
- And, risk the lives of the elves.
- Oh, dear.

434
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,250
I'll go, sir.

435
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,600
Bryony Shelfley, Wrapping
Division. Grade Three, sir!

436
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,940
- Who asked you?
- I wasn't called up for field duty this year,

437
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,150
Served up my mission
in gift-wrap support.

438
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:36,930
I wrapped
264,000 presents in 3 days, sir.

439
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,760
If you want that bike delivered
in a perfect state of enwrapment,

440
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,650
- then I'm your elf.
- No one is going!

441
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,320
- It's impossible!
- But, this child!

442
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:52,610
It's a margin of error of
0.00000001514834%, sir.

443
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,380
I mean, "Hello??"
Where's the champagne?

444
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,900
My department has
delivered the most

445
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,140
outstanding Christmas ever.

446
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,450
Well done, us.

447
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,500
But, there's a child
without a present.

448
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,900
Arthur, Christmas is not
a time for emotion.

449
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,320
We will get 47785BXK a present

450
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,030
within...the window of Christmas.

451
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,240
We'll messenger the item.
It'll be there in 5 days.

452
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,400
But, that'll ruin the magic.

453
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:26,470
If there was any way at all
to make the drop tonight;

454
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,700
it can't be done.

455
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,500
Your brother knows
about these things.

456
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,350
I won't sleep easy after this, Arthur.

457
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,210
But there it is.
It can't be done.

458
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,600
Merry Christmas.

459
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,640
Arthur,

460
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,640
you're compromising
the wrapping!

461
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,460
That is not a toy!

462
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,610
Well, it is, but that's not the--
ARTHUR!

463
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,160
C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, C'mon.

464
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,330
Child 47785BXK...

465
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,940
Where are you?

466
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,160
Dear Santa,
and my friend doesn't believe in you.

467
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,410
For Christmas, I'd like
a pink twinkle-bike.

468
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,560
Gwen Hines.

469
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,560
23 Mimosa Avenue

470
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,410
Trelew, Cornwall, England.

471
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,910
<i>Lights out.</i>

472
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,350
This figurehead thing.

473
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,380
I'm not just a
fatty with a suit, am I?

474
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,860
Of course not, dear.

475
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,640
No.  I'm Santa.

476
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,760
Children...

477
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,010
rely on me.

478
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,620
- Here.
- Thank you.

479
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,480
It's just cheques for the boys
and cash for Father.

480
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,060
Oh, Malcolm.

481
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,500
The 2 billion other gifts, dear.

482
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,900
Christmas has become
such a mad rush!

483
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,890
Until you...retire....

484
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,990
Retire?

485
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,040
Sit next to Father,
watching Steve on TV.

486
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,860
<i>You are sent a level 1 access HOHO.
Please state your identity.</i>

487
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,870
<i>State your identity.</i>

488
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,620
Who would I be?

489
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,120
You'd be my Malcolm, dear.

490
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,570
And there's...Arthur.

491
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,350
Dear Arthur.

492
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,220
What a puzzle.

493
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,170
- This one's from me, dear.
- Oh.

494
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,260
Happy Christmas, Margaret.

495
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,520
Oh, thank you.

496
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,080
I'm still very much
after the two of you, now.

497
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,340
Night, dear.

498
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,290
Good night,
Malcolm.

499
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,690
It just can't be.
It can't.

500
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:07,070
It just can't be. It can't.
It just CAN'T--

501
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,250
What's all this
caboodle, young man?

502
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,100
Grand-Santa!
It's this little girl.

503
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,630
- She's been missed.
- Ha!

504
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:15,440
So much for your brother's
fancy-pants technology.

505
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,150
No! Steve and Dad
wracked their brains,

506
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,860
- but they said it's impossible.
- Is it, now?

507
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,070
Missed a child.
Dear, oh, dear.

508
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,490
Sends shivers down me shins.

509
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,210
In 2 hours,
she's gonna wake up,

510
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:29,770
head downstairs,
search under the tree, and

511
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:34,360
the look on her face...

512
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,650
when there's nothing there.

513
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,380
She won't understand.

514
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,710
She'll think she's the
one kid in the whole world

515
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:44,250
that Santa doesn't care about.

516
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,800
She'll feel so...

517
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,480
left out.

518
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,020
On Christmas night,
he comes.

519
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,570
Gwen can't not have
a present from Santa.

520
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,260
Do you know, Arthur,

521
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,000
there is a way.

522
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,200
It's impossible.

523
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,780
They used to say
it was impossible

524
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,200
to teach women to read.

525
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,470
Follow me.

526
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,030
It's--

527
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,210
It's the actual sleigh!

528
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,930
Hello, Evie.

529
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,190
I though it was
scrapped years ago.

530
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,870
So did everyone else.

531
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,890
Icelandic birch.

532
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,540
Arctic balsa.

533
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,480
Built in 1845.

534
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,620
Able to reach
50,000 miles per hour

535
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,860
at a height of 40,000 feet!

536
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,370
- With a--
- Over here, you sprig of tinsel!

537
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:11,000
Potash of Carboniloroxy Amilocitrate...

538
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,470
Magic dust!

539
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,880
Mined from the aurora borealis.

540
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,240
She doesn't still...

541
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,350
go?

542
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,110
Not just a hobby, Arthur.

543
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:30,860
Great-great grandchildren
of the original 8.

544
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,250
Dasher!

545
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:46,620
Dancer!
Prancer!

546
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,700
Uh, what are the others called?
I could never ruddy remember.

547
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,100
B-Bambi?
-John!

548
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,890
You there,
with the white ear.

549
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,700
And you.
Not you, you bag of fleas.

550
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,980
- I'm not really good with big animals!
- Piffle!

551
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,900
Don't get bit-mind.
They can smell fear.

552
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,640
Let's hitch 'em up!

553
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,440
Grand-Santa!

554
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,030
Ah, excuse me.

555
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,860
You can go to Gwen,

556
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,860
on the old sleigh,
with the reindeer,

557
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,860
and the magic dust,
and everything!

558
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,680
It's a miracle!

559
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,110
You're coming too, lad.

560
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:26,070
Me? On that?
Up there?

561
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,070
Pulled by them?
Ah!

562
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,850
N-no way.

563
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:34,150
I'm 136. I can't do it
on me own. I need an elf.

564
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,150
I can't fly a sleigh!

565
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,780
I can't even ride
a bike without stabilizers.

566
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,990
I know! Let's
wake Steve. He'll--

567
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,090
No!

568
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,090
He's a worrier, Arthur.

569
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,330
What if he stops us?

570
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,330
Gwen's forgotten.

571
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,810
You really care.

572
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,200
Well, of course I do!

573
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,890
I was Santa, too.

574
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,340
Think of your dad.

575
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,190
Lying awake,
chewing his

576
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:01,010
beard off with
worry over this girl.

577
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,540
Don't you want
to help, for once?

578
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,020
Make him proud?

579
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,910
I can't.

580
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,660
I just...
I...

581
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,440
No! I can't.

582
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,440
Ready?

583
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,920
You promised not to go too fast!

584
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,620
I get travel sick,

585
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,490
and I'm allergic to snow!

586
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,450
Ho ho!
So you're a son of Santa?

587
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,910
Wait! My slippers!

588
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,450
They're not **!

589
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,550
Dash! Dash!

590
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:00,810
DAAAASSSHHH!!!

591
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,670
See? Who's Santa now?

592
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,630
Aah! Put me down!

593
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:21,210
- What's the matter, boy?
- I'm having a heart attack!

594
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,740
They've never flown before.
Just gotta break them in.

595
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,790
Now:

596
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,320
Come away!

597
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,060
Dash away!

598
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,560
Look, Arthur:

599
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,860
All those stars!

600
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,480
We're one of them, now.

601
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,290
A shooting star!

602
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:03,790
Stuck that there for
your dad when he was a boy.

603
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:06,060
Dad? He sat here?

604
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,300
So did I.

605
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,140
Every young heir to the Pole
gets took out by his father.

606
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:15,600
Right back to Saint Nick.

607
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,520
We Clauses used to be
the only men in the world

608
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,110
who could fly, Arthur.
See all this?

609
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,530
It was a gift.

610
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,890
Great big ball wrapped in
oceans and mountains.

611
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,740
I remember the look on your
father's face when he saw it.

612
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,720
Fish!

613
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,210
- With horns!
- Ha, ha!

614
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:16,760
Want to help me
make a snowman?

615
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,530
Ah! Where's the seatbelt?

616
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,220
Can Dad do that?

617
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,550
Did he make
a snowman for Steve?

618
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,690
Robot Roy? Ha!
Ice and cocoa.

619
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:43,470
Next Santa, and he's
never even sat in a sleigh.

620
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,510
- Is that...?
- The map of the Clauses.

621
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,370
Used every
Christmas night in history.

622
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:55,100
Whatever your brother says, Arthur,

623
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,350
it's the same old world.

624
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,660
- What is it?
- No idea! I've never seen it before!

625
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,250
- It's a city!
- New one erected.

626
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,780
They're always putting these things up.

627
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,740
I remember the first time
I ran into Chicago.

628
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,870
Chicago wasn't on the map?

629
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,350
Now then,
where are we?

630
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,480
Aha! Here we are. See?

631
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,610
Oho! No, that's Peking.

632
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,920
- Um...Ahead, there's a--
- Whoa!

633
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,000
They can see us!

634
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,030
Well, pull the camouflage lever!

635
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:37,280
Now, then. We'd better draw in
a few of these sky-scratchers. Just...

636
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,070
Well, that's a steam train, you ninny!

637
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,240
So, what do they call this place?

638
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,540
To-ron-to.

639
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,460
- Toronto's in Canada!
- The Santa's always come through Canada.

640
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,460
Nobody lives here.

641
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,580
It's nice and quiet.

642
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,480
'Til your brother came
along, with all his,

643
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,970
"You can't cut through
Saigon. There's a war." rubbish.

644
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,920
I don't need him to tell me
what's ahead. I've got eyes.

645
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,410
Grand-Santa!!

646
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,010
Ah! It's an elf!

647
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,380
Bryony Shelfley. Ow!

648
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,720
This is more stronger
than your gift wrap, sir,

649
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,900
- but I can fix it.
- A stowaway.

650
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,390
I can wrap anything, sir,

651
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,620
with three bits
of sticky tape. Three.

652
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,860
Good.
Wrap yourself a parachute.

653
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,910
Grand-Santa!

654
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,280
Toronto.

655
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,880
- Present and correct.
- Not quite, sir.

656
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,880
You've lost one of the reindeer!

657
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:58,160
Quantitative easing...
What the...? Hello?

658
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,470
- What elf?
<i>- Bryony Shelfley, sir.</i>

659
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,330
<i>The crazy wrapping elf,
you know?</i>

660
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:05,400
<i>Security tracked her
to sector 9-G, and...</i>

661
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,440
<i>- ...we think Arthur was here.</i>
- Arthur?

662
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,700
<i>Who else leaves
the door open, huh, sir?</i>

663
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,980
The old sleigh barn?

664
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,220
That was sealed up decades ago!

665
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,740
After that terrible night,

666
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,010
Grand-Santa sneaked out and...

667
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,580
Thank goodness he's
too old these days

668
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,670
to get into trouble.

669
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,630
Bash it with a brick, Arthur!

670
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,810
Go on!

671
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,080
Grab its antlers and tug.

672
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,620
I may just be
a wrapping operative, sir,

673
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,870
but this contravenes...

674
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:36,680
<i>seventeen</i>

675
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,160
specific mission regulations!

676
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,670
I'm in charge here,
not Billy the bureaucrat.

677
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,030
Tug!

678
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,580
<i>Eighteen.</i>

679
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,250
Wrap your head.

680
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,270
Come on, lad!

681
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,660
You're as much use
as a cheese chopstick!

682
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,810
Got it!

683
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,650
Oh, my big Aunt Betty...

684
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,950
It'll have to do.
Pass it down!

685
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,470
What?

686
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,990
Permission to breathe, sir.

687
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,940
I have about 9 seconds
left before I black out.

688
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,380
One breath.

689
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,040
- Sir?
- I said, "One."

690
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,400
Hurry up, Arthur.

691
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,480
Don't we need a whole one?

692
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,190
You know, to balance the sleigh?

693
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,720
Oh, it won't balance
the sleigh. No. No.

694
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,130
If anything,
it'll slow us down.

695
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,500
So, why are we taking it?

696
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,220
It's for Gwen.

697
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,040
Eight beautiful reindeer.

698
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,340
That's what she's dreaming of.

699
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,690
The jingly bells,
the sleigh on the roof.

700
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,860
- Yeah, but...
- That's what the kids want,

701
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,000
not some spaceship!

702
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,420
We're giving her the star treatment.

703
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,050
What now?

704
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,050
We have a waker, sir.

705
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,050
With a gun!

706
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,840
That's it, lad.
You distract it!

707
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,070
- Grand-Santa!
- Who's there?

708
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,680
We come in peace.

709
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,200
Our craft has to travel
around the world

710
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,200
in less than an hour!

711
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,310
We need the sign
for our slei--

712
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,800
craft.

713
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,250
Sorry I can't pay you.

714
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,800
Where I come from,
we don't have moneyyyy--

715
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,500
Christmas, 1923:

716
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,250
Had a heart attack at the reins.

717
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,460
Left ventricle
popped out me mouth.

718
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,460
Pushed it back down
and carried on.

719
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,790
Big, isn't it?
The Atlantic.

720
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,700
You think we should
stop and ask someone?

721
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,290
Pishy whipper!
We're nearly there!

722
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,670
See? I take the
North Star there

723
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,040
as a fixed point,

724
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,160
then I plot my bearings from--

725
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,820
That's a plane, sir.

726
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,520
Insubordination!
I'll have you harpooned, elf.

727
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,750
I thought it would be
chillier near England.

728
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,680
Uh...globular warming.

729
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,570
Ha! Land ahoy!

730
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,860
There it is!
Told you.

731
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,680
Now, now.
There you go.

732
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,830
England.

733
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,520
Maybe we've come
to the right a bit.

734
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,400
We're a reindeer short.

735
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,620
France.
<i>Bonjour.</i>

736
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,520
<i>Ou est le boulangerie?</i>

737
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,240
They have elephants in France?

738
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,480
The odd stray.
They breed in the drains.

739
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,860
This way.

740
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:42,350
<i>Buenos Días. Hola.</i>

741
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,790
Paris zoo.

742
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,410
Then this is where
they keep the lions!

743
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,730
They won't eat me.
I'm Santa!

744
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,770
Lie down!
Right.

745
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,950
- Call the keeper!
- How old is this?

746
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:03,480
Atlantis?
Here be cannibals?

747
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,480
You gotta watch out for cannibals.

748
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,510
This isn't France, is it?

749
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:10,900
Technically, it's North Africa.
Ah!

750
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,920
Serengeti National Park,
Tanzania.

751
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,540
Rubbish. How can
you possibly be sure?

752
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,800
The GPS in the HOHO, sir.

753
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,500
Take her!
Take the elf!

754
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,940
GPS?
Why didn't you say?

755
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,830
I'm a wrapping elf.
I don't navigate.

756
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,540
I wrap! I use it
to draw pictures of bows.

757
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,700
She's right. You've
brought us to Africa!

758
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,510
I've seen it on a stamp.

759
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:33,160
I'm too young
to die, Arthur!

760
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,830
Do something!
Arthur!!!!!!

761
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:44,990
The old sleigh?
What is happening here?

762
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,480
It was supposed to be chopped
up for firewood decades ago!

763
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,990
- Who on Earth would be that devious?
- Old people, sir.

764
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,570
Shall I get you
your stress ball?

765
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,380
We have a finer
comms array than the Pentagon,

766
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,930
and you say we
can't contact him

767
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:59,100
except by some crazy, ancient--

768
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,940
<i>Toodle-loo!</i>

769
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:04,610
<i>- Here comes the cavalry!</i>
- Ernie Clicker, sir.

770
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:09,820
Whole of communications
for 46 missions.

771
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,200
Me and your granddad
saw some time.

772
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,690
- I remember, once--
- Wow. Must catch up soon. Now...

773
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:23,550
Ooh, you're in a hurry.
I can tell.

774
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,440
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Can't we hurry this?

775
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:34,510
Ooh, you can't rush
the Stigdamater.

776
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:36,510
Got to play her gentle.

777
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:40,360
So, what do you
wish to say?

778
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,550
I wouldn't worry.

779
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:44,750
It's not like they're
facing man-eating lions.

780
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,860
♪ Silent night

781
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:53,820

- Oh! Something's coming through!
- What does it say?

790
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:52,600
ROAR...GRRR....

791
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:58,450
you mangy moron!

792
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,590
No!
That's Gwen's gift!

793
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:06,050
Only children get
to tear the wrapping!

794
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,340
- Bryony?!
- Automatic tape gun!

795
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,920
Bad doggy!
Bad doggy!

796
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,760
Laser-guided scissors!

797
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:19,390
Standard-issue gift-wrap!

798
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:20,540
There's no time for a bow!

799
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,990
There's always time for a bow!

800
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,430
Not that knob!

801
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:29,840
- Oh! Good night!
- Oh, no!

802
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,390
- Uhhh...
- Something else!

803
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,040
No! Leave it alone!

804
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:37,970
My camera!

805
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,460
Wait!
Look!

806
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,380
- Whoa!
- What's so funny?

807
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,950
Look what
they've done to my Evie!

808
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:35,100
And the map!

809
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,580
But, it's okay!
We've got this! Look:

810
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:40,400
Mimosa Avenue, Trelew.

811
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,060
<i>Proceed to the
highlighted route.</i>

812
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,460
What's the point?
Look at us.

813
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,510
And my camera totally bad-jacked.

814
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:49,500
- How do I get my picture now?
- What picture?

815
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,640
The sleigh on the roof,

816
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,050
the eight beautiful reindeer,
and Santa--me--

817
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:56,410
going down the chimney!

818
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:58,410
That's what I
wanted them to see.

819
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:00,850
They missed the kid,
but I got there.

820
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:03,040
My way.

821
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,900
That's why you came.

822
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:08,130
Not for Gwen.

823
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:13,200
<i>1,368 miles,
then, slight left.</i>

824
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:16,020
For the love of Lulu,

825
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,020
bossed about
by Tim TomTom.

826
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:23,050
Try them again.
Keep trying!

827
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:25,700
All this about 1 child...
in 600 million!

828
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,760
We can turn their **.

829
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,400
Don't worry, sir.
Children are stupid.

830
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,120
Either he won't know
he got missed,

831
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,830
or he'll think he's been bad!

832
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:35,000
It's a win-win!

833
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,770
You missed one?
A nipper?

834
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,800
What's all this here for,
if you've missed one?

835
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,290
Would you please
type faster?

836
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:51,470
<i>Systems critical.
Lead in Christmas.</i>

837
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:00,450
Peter?

838
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:02,160
Let go of my hand, please.

839
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,760
Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.

840
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,140
And get me IT.

841
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,590
<i>Descend 1,000 feet.</i>

842
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:16,890
<i>You are at your destination.</i>

843
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:19,860
Whoo-hoo! We did it!

844
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:22,470
Woopty-doo.

845
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:25,020
<i>In 100 yards,
turn left.</i>

846
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,320
<i>Straight ahead.
Turn right. Left again.</i>

847
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,890
<i>You are at your client's dwelling.</i>

848
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:30,090
Steady!

849
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:37,580
We made it.
I survived!

850
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,240
I'll walk home,
I'll get a boat,

851
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:47,100
but I am never getting back
in that crazy flying death-trap ever again!

852
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:50,070
Go on.

853
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,650
Get it over.

854
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:53,860
I want my bed.

855
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,170
You're not coming?

856
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:00,920
You have to deliver the present!

857
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,090
You put your
special coat on.

858
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:04,810
You're our Santa!

859
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,930
I said, me and Evie
could get here and we did.

860
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:10,510
The rest is just elf work.

861
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:14,380
Go on , Festive Freddy,
sling your hook.

862
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,340
It doesn't matter
how we got here.

863
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:21,450
The sleigh on the roof,

864
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:24,890
the jingle bells;
the eight reindeer.

865
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:28,190
Gwen would never
have seen that.

866
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:49,080
I wish Dad could see this.

867
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,470
It would take
such a load off his mind.

868
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:52,690
So,

869
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:55,470
what are your orders?

870
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:56,860
You're a Claus.

871
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,580
You give the orders.

872
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:02,930
I'm just happy being an elf, really.

873
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:05,950
You know,
just part of it all.

874
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,730
You want the orderly
to go through the cat flap?

875
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:11,090
Oh, yes.
That's a grand idea.

876
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:15,170
Do you want
the girl to let you in?

877
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:16,940
Brilliant!
Thank you, Bryony.

878
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:20,810
And do you want...
Wait!

879
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:23,380
Uh, the alarm?
Yes! Definitely!

880
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,520
Is this your first time?

881
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,480
Bryony?

882
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:39,070
He loves these slippers
even more than you do!

883
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:48,390
Merry Christmas.

884
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:51,850
When you put
the address into the HOHO,

885
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:54,000
- what did you see?
- A list of Trelews.

886
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,740
I just clicked on the first one.

887
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,330
Which was not Trelew, England!

888
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:01,240
We're in the wrong Trelew!

889
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,210
They've been watching us.

890
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,190
They've seen Evie!

891
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:14,430
It's just like last time!

892
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:16,370
<i>Governments tonight
are waking to news of a UFO</i>

893
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:18,540
<i>traveling around the globe
at incredible speed.</i>

894
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,920
<i>The clear sighting was at
this tractor dealership in Idaho.</i>

895
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,210
<i>...and eyeballs on its feet,
and a pointy little head.</i>

896
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,820
<i>- It asked me for a sign.</i>
- We're on the news!

897
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:30,770
<i>And from the trail
left in Toronto,</i>

898
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:32,880
<i>these beings do not
appear to be friendly.</i>

899
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,650
We are online, sir.

900
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,020
<i>This is KPP-Charlotte.</i>

901
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,820
<i>** police found
a little furry thing</i>

902
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,040
<i>which tried to mate
with a dog.</i>

903
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,260
<i>Paul, I have calls reporting a
steam train flying around downtown.</i>

904
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:46,630
<i>- What do you see on satellite?
- It's gone black over Mexico.</i>

905
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:48,900
<i>This thing is going faster
than anything we know of.</i>

906
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:51,750
<i>The herd is now
in Mozambique's airspace,</i>

907
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,640
<i>threatening the fragile peace</i>

908
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,940
<i>between the two nations.</i>

909
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,830
Two billion items delivered,

910
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:59,650
and we didn't leave
a footprint in the snow. And now?

911
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:03,030
Sir, we have lost
50% of our data.

912
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,680
No! No! We have 18 pulse data
reservoirs of a trillion terabytes!

913
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,050
Sorry.
Auto-save was off.

914
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,480
Shall I sock it, sir?

915
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:11,360
Quite hard?

916
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,080
Sir, there's a polar bear on level 6.

917
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:17,440
Sir, why is Arthur out there?

918
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:19,270
He missed one.

919
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:20,800
A nipper.

920
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,430
I mean:  47785BXK.

921
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,650
Sir, we've got something.

922
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,040
Bryony Shelfley.

923
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,400
It's her HOHO.

924
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,220
We can still get there.

925
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,220
We just have
to go faster. Higher.

926
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,960
You changed your tune.

927
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,570
I'm not going anywhere!

928
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:44,970
I'm not here!

929
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:47,920
- I taped myself in, Grand-Santa!
- Leave me alone!

930
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:51,150
- It's that terrible night, all over again!
- What night?

931
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:53,550
Last time I
took Evie for a spin,

932
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,310
I didn't know
it was the Cuban Missile crisis!

933
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:58,610
I nearly started World War III.

934
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:02,770
Someone has to drive!

935
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:08,790
Oh, no! Fencer!
Mincer! Come back!

936
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:12,370
- Bryony!
- Hi-ya!

937
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,930
Grand-Santa, get here!

938
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:20,400
Oy, that's me new hip!

939
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,120
Please!
I'll read you Gwen's letter.

940
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:25,510
Stone-deaf. I'm 136.

941
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,930
- What's that?
- It's Steve!

942
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:30,070
- Steve!
- Tell him I'm not here!

943
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:32,410
Grand-Santa says he's not here.

944
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:35,470
<i>Hi. I'm looking for a missing relic.</i>

945
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:37,820
<i>- Steve, three words.</i>
- Is the first one help?

946
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:40,460
<i>- Yes! You can help us, Steve!
- It was him!</i>

947
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,840
<i>Trusty the Madman!
He forced me to come!</i>

948
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,690
<i>Elf, back me up
if you want a career.</i>

949
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:46,930
<i>- I forced you?
- You see? Look--</i>

950
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:49,240
What do you want, Grand-Santa?
Let me guess.

951
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,530
Hmm. A picture of you,
in the sleigh,

952
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:54,990
delivering the gift,
to show me how it's really done?

953
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:57,560
<i>- No.</i>
- Do you know the picture they'll have tomorrow?

954
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,560
You led away in handcuffs.

955
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,900
The Santa who was seen.
By everybody on Earth.

956
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,900
<i>The Santa who ruined Christmas.</i>

957
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,940
<i>Ruined it!</i>

958
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:07,690
<i>We'll fix this, Steve.</i>

959
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,420
<i>We'll be back home
in the whup of a reindeer's buttocks.</i>

960
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,600
<i>And Evie can go back in mothballs.</i>

961
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,530
<i>You can forget she ever existed.</i>

962
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,530
<i>You can't just go home!</i>

963
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:18,530
<i>- What about Gwen?</i>
- Gwen.

964
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:20,950
For that,
you'd threaten my whole operation?

965
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:22,870
<i>Steve, you said
if there was any way</i>

966
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,330
<i>to get there, you would.
Well, this is it!</i>

967
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:27,680
<i>Look:
The old sleigh's perfect!</i>

968
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,530
<i>Ah, right. Well, anyway,
it goes really fast,</i>

969
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:32,010
<i>even with things missing,</i>

970
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:34,130
<i>and we've got
quite a few reindeer left,</i>

971
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:36,980
<i>and, if I'm sick again,
I can be sick in a bag!</i>

972
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,580
<i>I'll wrap him one.</i>

973
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,800
- We can help them, sir.
- "No one missed", sir.

974
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:43,810
"All correct presents,
present and correct," sir!

975
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:47,050
<i>If you help us, Steve,
we can do it.</i>

976
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,660
Grand-Santa and Arthur
would be the heroes of the night, sir!

977
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:01,440
Come home, now!

978
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,610
If we all just
gave in to Christmas spirit,

979
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:05,020
there'd be chaos!

980
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:08,050
<i>- We're on our way, Steve.
- No!</i>

981
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:10,010
<i>Santa would want to get to Gwen.</i>

982
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,250
<i>Ask him.  Please.</i>

983
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:14,250
Arthur...

984
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:16,770
This is Dad
we're talking about.

985
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:19,930
There was a time
when he cared about every last gift tag,

986
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:22,820
but now,
he just wants to be loved.

987
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,770
Get some rest.

988
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:26,280
<i>No.</i>

989
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,560
<i>He's lying awake,</i>

990
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,110
<i>worrying his beard off about Gwen.</i>

991
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:34,390
<i>Off to the land of Nod.</i>

992
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:37,220
<i>Please, do not disturb
until December 26.</i>

993
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:39,530
<i>- Is that it, dear?
- Yes, Malcom! Press 3.</i>

994
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:43,390
<i>No!</i>

995
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:46,200
<i>Santa's the most
caring man in the world.</i>

996
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,780
<i>So, why are you here,
not him?</i>

997
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,710
Don't leave me, Arthur.

998
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:16,960
Poor old man
and his reindeer,

999
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,300
on our own at Christmas.

1000
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:24,080
<i>At least have the decency
to finish us off with a rock!</i>

1001
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,290
Poor Evie.

1002
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,250
Sun will be up soon.

1003
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,250
It's Christmas!

1004
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:10,720
Christmas is for kids.

1005
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,040
You grow out of it.

1006
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:15,030
What,
in the last six minutes?

1007
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:18,780
I know what you
all say about me, you know.

1008
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:22,120
"He belongs in the South Pole."

1009
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,490
"Poor Arthur."

1010
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:26,920
"What a puzzle."

1011
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:29,770
Well, you were right.

1012
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:29,780
All that fuss over one kid.
Well, you were right.

1013
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:32,160
All that fuss over one kid.

1014
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:36,020
I must be ridiculous!

1015
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,340
This is nice.

1016
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:42,390
Good to get
away from it all, you know.

1017
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:45,050
All the Christmas fuss.

1018
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:56,680
I'm sorry I've messed things up, lad.

1019
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:01,870
You see,
the night I last took Evie out,

1020
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:05,210
when there was all that....fuss,

1021
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:07,340
your father came to me.

1022
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:09,340
I'll never forget it;

1023
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:11,660
couldn't look me in the eye.

1024
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,910
"Dad," he says,

1025
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,940
"Steve thinks it best
you don't fly again."

1026
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:22,490
"We're scrapping the sleigh."

1027
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,180
Me only son,

1028
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:29,710
who used to sit where you sit,
looking up at me.

1029
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:34,940
I just wanted them to remember

1030
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:37,290
who I used to be.

1031
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:41,520
I was a bit like you, lad.

1032
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,000
Keen as cranberry.

1033
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:46,590
So was your dad.

1034
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:49,230
You get old.
That's all.

1035
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:52,250
Everything...changes.

1036
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:54,130
Does it?

1037
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:56,910
How can I ever write

1038
01:00:56,910 --> 01:01:00,730
another letter
saying that Santa cares?

1039
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:10,320
Good night, Dad.

1040
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:12,690
Sleep well.

1041
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,940
Sir, we know
you shouldn't believe rumors,

1042
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:25,080
but we do.

1043
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,180
Is it true you missed a child?

1044
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,330
Me? No, no.

1045
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:31,570
Well, in a way, yes.

1046
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:34,830
It was just one.

1047
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:36,780
In fact,
not even that.

1048
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:39,280
Naught point,
lots more naughts,

1049
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,360
then a number,

1050
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,130
and some sort
of percent at the end.

1051
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:45,130
Not really an error.
Just a one.

1052
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:47,310
One child doesn't matter?

1053
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:49,580
- Which one?
- Well, I...

1054
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:53,030
Well, I did nice ones in **,
does those ones matter?

1055
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,650
What about my ones in Germany?

1056
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:58,480
- One of them was twins!
- They don't matter. **

1057
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,340
Why don't you ask Steve?
He can explain.

1058
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:05,070
- Fiendishly clever.
- But, aren't you in charge, sir?

1059
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,930
Of course.
I'm Santa.

1060
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:12,900
Sir, if the one that
got missed doesn't matter,

1061
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,910
why have Arthur and
Grand-Santa gone to take it?

1062
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:18,340
- What? Oh...
- Malcolm,

1063
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:20,720
What's this about Arthur?

1064
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:26,460
<i>It's the religious children
who don't matter.</i>

1065
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:28,760
Santa says they don't matter 100%.

1066
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:31,950
<i>Is it true? Children aren't real?
They're just anti-matter?</i>

1067
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:34,130
Ssh! No! No! Look,

1068
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:37,380
I festivized every single
country in the world!

1069
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:40,660
You see? This one. This one.
This one. All of them!

1070
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:43,980
I mean, who cares about
one single tiny child?

1071
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:49,090
Uh...I do.

1072
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:51,090
Oh, Arthur.

1073
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:54,000
My poor boy!

1074
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,570
Why on Earth would he...

1075
01:02:56,570 --> 01:03:00,460
Well, you're his brother, Steve.
How could you let him?

1076
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:04,360
And, um, about
this child you missed,

1077
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:08,050
I'm really not sure
you made the right decision.

1078
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:12,520
Is that bird poo on your shoulder?

01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:16,080

Reindeer are

dappled cretins

1132
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:01,540
with twigs on their heads.

1133
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:04,670
They'll just keep going

01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:08,070
They'll be

01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:10,220

1137
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:12,580

01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,940
So, where is this UFO?

1141
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:23,760
It's circling the Earth, ma'am.

1142
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,120
19 minutes ago,
it went into orbit.

1143
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,180
You?
Up there?

1144
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:31,340
Catch that

1145
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:32,810
Magic dust!

1146
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:35,690
You crack it over your head.
You'll have to focus.

1147
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:38,660
The sleigh will be coming at you
at 45,000 miles an hour.

1148
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:41,670
- 45,000?
- You'll be torn in half!

1149
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:43,680
Depends on the angle
the sleigh hits.

1150
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,090
You might just get beheaded.

1151
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:48,050
I've got a phobia of
being beheaded, and heights!

1152
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:50,300
And speed,
and reindeer,

1153
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,370
and... the buttons.

1154
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:55,600
- Buttons?
- Yeah. I'm pretty much scared of everything.

1155
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:58,170
Gwen thinks you're coming.

1156
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:00,450
You can't do this.
Yes, you can!

1157
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:02,650
No, you can't.
Yes, you can. COME ON, ARTHUR!

1158
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:03,620
Don't worry, son.

1159
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:05,020
Only a raving lunatic--

1160
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:08,990
I have to worry!
It's the only thing I'm good at!

1161
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:11,470
- Worry me.
- The sleigh will be back any minute!

1162
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:14,230
Come on!
Worry me! Quickly!

1163
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,220
Imagine Gwen,
all alone.

1164
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:18,470
- nothing under the tree...

1165
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,800
Here we go!

1166
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,810
Aaahh! I don't
like this! Stop!

1167
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:25,680
- Stop! Get me down!
- Tears, as she finds she's been left out!

1168
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,070
Screaming "Santa didn't come!"

1169
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:30,540
Oh, Gwen...
Aaaaahhhhoho!

1170
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:32,660
It's just too high!

1171
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:35,580
Gwen, in the street,
surrounded by kids on new bikes,

1172
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:40,200
- No!
- She runs away.

1173
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,760
Alcoholic by the age of 9.

1174
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:43,600
Dead before she
gave birth--

1175
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,460
She may never
build a snowman again!

1176
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,860
What if there are buttons
on the sleigh I don't know about?

1177
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,860
Here they come!

1178
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,960
How do you
think he's, uh...

1179
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,040
Fine. Fine.

1180
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,400
Probably just, uh...

1181
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,590
So, how come you
didn't scrap the sleigh, sir?

1182
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:37,000
I threatened the elves.

1183
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,470
Said I'd feed 'em
to the polar bears.

1184
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,050
Elf, how do you fancy

1185
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:56,250
being the one to
tell his parents about all this?

1186
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:32,160
Yaaay! Arthur,
you did it!

1187
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,700
I did it with worry!

1188
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,090
I'm sure you're dying with fear!

1189
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:38,230
<i>Proceed to the
highlighted route.</i>

1190
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:40,520
<i>Proceed to the--</i>

Yes.

1199
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:04,710
And find Arthur a father.

1200
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:05,900
Well done, dear.

1201
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,530
Trelew's on a course
for 187.7 degrees

1202
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,890
from the geographic pole,

1203
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,550
but as it's the old sleigh,

1204
01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:15,380
we should allow a drift margin
of 1,000 miles outside the Greenwich meridian.

1205
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:18,100
I put a sweater for Arthur,
your father's pills,

1206
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,740
and some nice, sweet tea.

1207

Send everyone crazy!

1215
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,290
He'll destroy Christmas!

Really, Malcolm, there's
no harm in using a manual. Men...

1221
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:05,640
Margaret, I order you to disembark.
It's not safe.

1222
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:08,870
Piffle. I did a bite of
light-flying course on the Internet.

1223
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:11,590
It can't be that different.

1224
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:13,510
Oh. Steve.

1225
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:15,290
You dented it!

1226
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,000
You take it out
without asking!

1227
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,340
Malcolm! You
told me he knew!

1228
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:21,510
You know how Steve
feels about his S-1.

1229
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:23,030
My S-1!

1230
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:24,280
"S" for Santa!

1231
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:26,170
I'm flying to this child!

1232
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:30,090
She's all that matters!
Not me, your son!

1233
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:34,250
Not the 2 billion things
I did right tonight! No.

1234
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:37,190
This is about that
pool table, isn't it?

1235
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:40,000
I told you,
you should have written to me.

1236
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,300
I was eight!

1237
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,700
- You're my dad!
- For goodness' sake!

1238
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:45,830
Arthur and Grand-Santa
are out there

1239
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:48,090
probably not wearing
nearly enough layers,

1240
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:50,810
and you two are
bickering over a big, red toy!

1241
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:52,190
I... I'm not bickering.

1242
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:54,620
If Steven could
just stand back-- OOF!

1243
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,620
<i>Air bag.</i>

1244
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,530
You drive, Steven.

1245
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:05,900
Thank you.

1246
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:12,790
So, since gift delivery to
child 47785BXK is all that seems to matter,

1247
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:14,280
I'll do it myself.

1248
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,060
Then we'll pick up
Arthur and Grand-Santa

1249
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:18,200
from whatever ditch
they've ended up in.

1250
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,280
<i>Maximum thrust.</i>

1251
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:29,510
<i>Um... when Santa said he'd be right back...
what do you think he'd, um--</i>

1252
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:31,510
He's not coming back!

1253
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:33,030
The Santas are leaving!

1254
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:34,420
The children don't matter?

1255
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:36,870
- Christmas doesn't matter!
- Nothing, man!

1256
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:39,880
It's like 1816!

1257
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,230
- Abandon the North Pole!
- Everybody panic!

1258
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:44,770
<i>Are you sure
you want to delete Christmas?</i>

1259
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,970
<i>Meltdown:  10 minutes.</i>

1260
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:54,960
I know where
we can find a map, lad.

1261
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:58,790
It's a bit risky, this.

1262
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:02,680
Breaking the rules,
even in the old days!

1263
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,110
There:

1264
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:28,060
Biggest map in the world!

1265
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:34,320
Dash!

1266
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:37,410
<i>Friends,
on this night of peace,</i>

1267
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:41,160
we stand confronted
by an unknown danger:

1268
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,410
aliens.

1269
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:44,110
Aliens from space.

1270
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:49,290
What talk about?
Maybe the aliens come in peace?

1271
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:53,350
They burst an inflatable Santa Claus
in Toronto, on Christmas night!

1272
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:56,290
Let us attempt contact,

1273
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:59,130
but be ready
to save our planet!

1274
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:03,250
Hold tight, lad!

1275
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:05,290
This is where
it gets really rough.

1276
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:20,920
Not now,
you sack of antlers!

1277
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:30,360
- Yay!
- Woo-hoo!

1278
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,490
Coming down through
the atmosphere, ma'am.

1279
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:35,490
- We'll see it any minute.
- 46...

1280
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:38,730
45...44...43...

1281
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:40,510
They'll be waiting for us, sir.

1282
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:41,880
We were on the news!

1283
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:45,800
All their technology,
against my Evie!

1284
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:50,000
Well, come on!
Let's do it with worry!

1285
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:52,930
Santa mustn't be seen,
eh, lad?

1286
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:55,280
Let's give them
something to shoot at!

1287
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,420
We have visual.
Here it comes!

1288
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,810
Take us to your leader!
Ha, ha!

1289
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:06,180
England!

1290
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:07,780
No sign of anyone.

1291
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:09,440
- The sun's coming up!
- Come on, lad!

1292
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,190
You can do it!

1293
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:14,320
Mankind greets you.
Do you copy?

1294
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,980
Season's greetings
from mankind.

1295
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:17,410
Good morning.
Do you copy?

1296
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:19,820
The hull is some kind of
woody substance, ma'am.

1297
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:21,590
Like... wood.

1298
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:23,250
Coated in lead paint!

1299
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:27,270
- Yes, it seems to be alive.
- And furry!

1300
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:31,230
Come on, lad.

She doesn't fit
this world, Arthur.

1323
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,280
She's a relic.

1324
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,050
Evie?

1325
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:29,660
I always knew she'd
be needed one more time.

You were right, Arthur.

It doesn't matter how
Santa's gift gets there.

Maybe the next Santa
never sat in my Evie,

1347
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:27,370
but Arthur did,

1348
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:31,870

Well done, dear.

1356
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:19,350
Poor Arthur.
He tried so hard.

1357
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:23,490
- He's flunked again.
- Of course he hasn't, dear.

1358
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:27,300
We're here. The little
girl will get her present.

1359
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,850

rather splendidly.

Apologies for the minor delay.

1363
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:42,500
I'm sure that even a child

1364
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,760
can understand that in an
operation as complex as Christmas,

1365
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:49,580
there's always an
insignificant margin of error.

1366
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:51,010
Which is you.

01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:53,550

9.99 more than your requested gift.

just signing a legal waiver.
