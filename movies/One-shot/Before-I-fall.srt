1
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:05,822
<i>Maybe for you
there's a tomorrow.</i>

2
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:23,246
<i>Maybe for you
there's 1,000 or 3,000</i>

3
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:26,672
<i>or 10.</i>

4
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:41,846
<i>So much time
you can bathe in it.</i>

5
00:01:48,318 --> 00:01:50,148
<i>So much time you can waste it.</i>

6
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:58,655
<i>But for some of us,</i>

7
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:02,082
<i>there's only today.</i>

8
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:04,165
<i>And what you do today matters.</i>

9
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:09,457
<i>In the moment,
and maybe into infinity.</i>

10
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,980
<i>But I didn't know any of that
until right before I fell.</i>

11
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:28,784
<i>The thing is,
you don't get to know.</i>

12
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:31,819
<i>You don't wake up with a bad
feeling in your stomach</i>

13
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:33,403
<i>or see shadows move.</i>

14
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:39,115
<i>If you're like me, you wake
up 24 minutes and 47 seconds</i>

15
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:42,082
<i>before your best friend is
supposed to be picking you up.</i>

16
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:44,665
<i>If you're like me,</i>

17
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,539
<i>your last day starts like this.</i>

18
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:38,508
Well, I'll let you know by noon.

19
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:41,512
Well, I can't organize
a playdate before...

20
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:43,268
You want something to eat?
No. I'm good.

21
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,100
Sammy, you like
the bird I made you?

22
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:48,647
Morning.

23
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:52,648
Sammy!
What?

24
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,145
You forgot your gloves!

25
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,282
Izzy, how many times
do I have to tell you?

26
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:57,454
Don't touch my stuff.

27
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:00,278
Go back inside.
It's cold.

28
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,832
Hey, sexy. Get in!

29
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:10,918
Okay.

30
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:21,392
I love the sky
on mornings like this.

31
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:23,013
Hey.

32
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,314
Greasy forehead, window, off.

33
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:30,098
I'm gonna try
not to be depressed

34
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:31,728
because I'm single on Cupid Day.

35
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,030
That's Valentine's Day to you!

36
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,087
Do you have insomnia
or something, Linds?

37
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,151
Excuse me?

38
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,557
It's just cute that you get up
before us and get breakfast.

39
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:42,738
Ooh. Did she just call me cute, Kingston?

40
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,542
I believe she did, Edgecomb.
Mmm-mmm.

41
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:48,041
Al, Linds doesn't do "cute." No.

42
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:51,132
It's not in her lexicon.
Lexicon? Nice word choice.

43
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,010
Whoo!

44
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:58,553
Come on.

45
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:07,391
Seriously?

46
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,850
Okay, this was maybe funny the
first bazillion times you did it.

47
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:13,063
It's still funny.
It still is.

48
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:14,862
Still funny!
Love it. Every time.

49
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:19,646
Yeah, baby!

50
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:25,372
No texting and driving.

51
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:29,001
Don't worry. I'd never let
my best friend die a virgin.

52
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:30,497
Ooh!

53
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,101
You didn't think
we'd forget, did you?

54
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,585
It's the big day, opening night.

55
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:38,174
Rob texted me. He said,
"I made my bed for you."

56
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:40,682
That is so sweet.
Yes.

57
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:43,682
No glove, no love.
You hear me?

58
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:46,637
Take it!
Take it! Take it!

59
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,075
Take it!
Take it! Take it! Take it!

60
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:49,309
Shh! Okay, okay...

61
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:51,478
Watch the road. Oh, my God.
Lindsay!

62
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:53,122
All right. I'm sorry.
We're fine. We're fine.

63
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:54,186
You're crazy!

64
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:55,522
We're freakin' fine.

65
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,066
<i>Go ahead and say we're through</i>

66
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:59,777
<i>I don't care,
I'll just get another you</i>

67
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:01,821
<i>I'll get another dude
that look like you</i>

68
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:04,026
<i>I don't need you
and you don't need me</i>

69
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:05,405
<i>Give me back my house key</i>

70
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:08,372
<i>You can leave it
with my new boyfriend</i>

71
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:11,163
<i>You can leave it on the back
back, back porch</i>

72
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,250
<i>I don't care, when you
leave it leave a message</i>

73
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:14,632
<i>A message, a message, a message</i>

74
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:16,249
<i>You used to never
get the message</i>

75
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:17,545
<i>Yeah, I talk shit</i>

76
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:18,668
<i>Yeah, she's talkin' shit</i>

77
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:19,955
<i>Go ahead and say we're through</i>

78
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,340
<i>I don't care
I'll just get another you</i>

79
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:24,255
<i>I'll get another dude
that look like you</i>

80
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,513
<i>I don't need you
and you don't need me</i>

81
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:27,966
<i>Give me back my house key</i>

82
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:29,346
<i>My house key My house key</i>

83
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:37,398
<i>This could be easy</i>

84
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,238
<i>This could be easy</i>

85
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:49,119
<i>This could be easy</i>

86
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:54,831
<i>This could be easy</i>

87
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:06,012
How many roses did you
get last year, Linds?

88
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:07,637
Twenty-two.

89
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,510
I'm going for 25
this year, though,

90
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:12,057
and more than one of them
better be from Patrick.

91
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:15,061
Did I tell you
I sat next to Rob,

92
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:18,064
and I had to make him fill
out the request form?

93
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,482
It was depressing.

94
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:23,526
I'd be happy with 15. I'm
not ashamed to admit it.

95
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:27,161
Last year, Matt literally
sent me a dozen red roses.

96
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,870
Matt, oh, come on.

97
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:31,911
You just spent
a whole week crying

98
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,214
in the same pair of
sweatpants and it got dark.

99
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:35,682
We're not going back there.

100
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:39,246
No, I've told you a thousand
times, I'll say it again,

101
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:42,918
you do not need
that loser. Honestly.

102
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:45,377
Mmm-mmm. Nope. You got
your real baes here.

103
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,296
Mmm-hmm. We love you. Come here.

104
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,260
Till death do us part.
Even then.

105
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,179
Oh, get in here.

106
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,426
Mmm.

107
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:55,757
All right, bitches, let's move!

108
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:02,572
Sisyphus, not an STD.

109
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:05,862
What's he like?

110
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:10,704
What does it mean when something
is described as being Sisyphean?

111
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,079
Does it mean pointless?

112
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,664
Brave?

113
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:19,634
Late?

114
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,249
Uh, sorry, it was an
emergency and a tribulation.

115
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:26,508
It was a minor
LaserJet explosion.

116
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:27,971
Hope the printer survived.

117
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:31,139
All right, back to Sisyphus.

118
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,104
What's his character like?

119
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:35,521
Does he learn from
pushing that boulder...

120
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:37,851
Hey.

121
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:38,935
Val-a-gram delivery.

122
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,530
Happy Cupid Day.
Go ahead.

123
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:00,713
Relax, it's just roses.

124
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,167
Aw, no roses for Anna.

125
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:05,053
Is that from your boy?

126
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:06,379
It's from Rob. Yeah.

127
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:09,131
All right, all right. Keep it down.
Keep it down, people.

128
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,434
It's so beautiful.

129
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:22,438
I'm in heteronormative hell.

130
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:31,952
Okay, okay, let's hope third
time's the charm. Okay?

131
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,990
Sisyphus.

132
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,536
Yo, Sam.
Hey.

133
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,328
Yo, Sam.
Hey.

134
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:49,514
Man.

135
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:52,799
Sam, hey.
Hi.

136
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:55,048
Did you like it?
Like what?

137
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:57,563
Hey, so, um, big party tonight.

138
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,350
Mom is going out of town. Whoa.

139
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,983
A huge rager, you know.
Why don't you come, yeah?

140
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:03,205
I don't know what my plans are,

141
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:04,456
like, what everyone else
ends up doing...

142
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,749
So I'll see you tonight.
I don't think so.

143
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,403
Yeah? You know the address.
No. Kent...

144
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:09,276
Smooth.

145
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,090
Did you guys hear about Anna?
You mean bull dyke.

146
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:31,761
Please say she tripped
over her nose.

147
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,336
Not yet, but her
girlfriend saw this Snap

148
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:35,907
that we posted
with her and that girl.

149
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,970
She straight up dumped her.

150
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,222
See?
What?

151
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:41,977
This is why I deserve
some public recognition,

152
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,559
for making shit
like that happen.

153
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,564
Maybe someone should
give me a ribbon.

154
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:48,318
Like the ones that you used
to have hanging on your wall,

155
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,279
Sammy, remember,
from horseback riding?

156
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:52,033
I was, like,
ten years old, Lindsay.

157
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:53,951
God, Sam, you were
such a nerd back then.

158
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,410
Okay, but isn't it weird
how that stuff happens?

159
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,850
How things connect
in strange ways?

160
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,303
Like if Lindsay
didn't post that Snap...

161
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:00,327
She deserved it.

162
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:01,933
I'm just saying,
it's kinda crazy now.

163
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:04,748
I saw this video about chaos
in the universe... Listen!

164
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:07,212
How a bird flapping its
wings in South America

165
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:08,923
can create a major
rainstorm in New York.

166
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:12,006
Like how one person can watch a
pretentious video about chaos

167
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,839
while three other people
actually die of boredom.

168
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,485
It wasn't a YouTube tutorial, so
you guys wouldn't get it anyway.

169
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:18,553
Owie!

170
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,849
Samantha Kingston.

171
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:21,474
- Hi.
- Hey, Rob.

172
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:25,346
Did you get my rose?
I did.

173
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,273
Who are these ones from?

174
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,665
Your competition.
I want to see.

175
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:29,689
Your competition.

176
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:31,460
Oh, Sam has no competition, Rob.
You know it.

177
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:34,204
Okay. Well, neither do I, so I guess
we're perfect for each other.

178
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,993
So you're going to that
thing at Kent's tonight?

179
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:41,219
I heard he's getting a couple kegs.
I don't know.

180
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,293
Yes!

181
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,710
I'll text you later.
One more.

182
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:46,619
No, I'm eating!
Get out!

183
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Go.
Bye.

184
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:49,853
You all are too cute.
It's gross.

185
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,297
Mmm.
Oh, you guys!

186
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:54,296
Tonight our widdle Sammy
passes into womanhood.

187
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:55,932
I am so proud.

188
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:57,178
Shh! Stop it.

189
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:58,968
I hope you shaved.

190
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,353
Oh, my God.

191
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,772
Don't forget to pee
before and after.

192
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,687
Guys, guys, sociopath,
12 o'clock.

193
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:13,402
Oh, God. Does she
know what a brush is?

194
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,029
No.

195
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:17,664
Norma Bates!

196
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,980
Hey, did she get
her Val-a-gram?

197
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:22,552
In chem, I was sitting
right behind her.

198
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:23,616
What'd she say?

199
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:24,792
Does she say anything ever?

200
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,910
Well, what'd she do?

201
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,360
She tossed it right after class.

202
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:28,975
She really should
appreciate it more.

203
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,719
It's probably the only rose
she'll ever get.

204
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:33,586
Maybe it had something
to do with the card.

205
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:36,511
"Maybe next year,
but probably not."

206
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,190
That's it, guys!

207
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:58,778
Go, girl.

208
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,030
I love it!

209
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,510
It kinda looks like you
put it on your cheeks.

210
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:05,704
It's the same color.
Yeah. That's the point.

211
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:08,121
Mmm.

212
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,865
Love it.
It's so effing good.

213
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:12,542
Can I post this one?

214
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:14,961
No.

215
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,335
Don't laugh at me.
Okay.

216
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:22,719
Linds?

217
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:31,058
Were you nervous
your first time?

218
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:36,734
I was too drunk to be anything.

219
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:39,814
Don't freak out if it hurts.

220
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:41,704
Especially at first.

221
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,120
And don't tense up, because
that only makes it worse.

222
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:47,953
Great. That sounds
really romantic.

223
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:50,140
Don't worry. It's not like
Rob is some random guy.

224
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:52,004
You actually like him.
Right. Yes.

225
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,670
Everyone wants to
hook up with him.

226
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,093
Yeah.

227
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,010
Tonight, everything changes.

228
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,471
That face.

229
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:05,258
Baes!

230
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,104
What are you doing? What
do you think you're doing?

231
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,451
Fart's house
is actually kinda nice.

232
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:27,802
If I had known,
I would have stopped

233
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,946
calling him Danny DeVito
all year.

234
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:31,711
Sam and you.

235
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,278
Hey, I'm gonna go find Patrick.
Will you be okay?

236
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,189
What? I'm gonna go find Patrick.

237
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:03,638
Will you be okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

238
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,066
Mwah!

239
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,502
Hey, Sam!

240
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,171
You made it.

241
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:24,261
Sam! Sam!
Hi!

242
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:29,642
Oh, I am sorry.
Let me get that for you.

243
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:33,726
How drunk are you?

244
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,251
I'm not drunk.
Don't worry about it.

245
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:36,903
Know what?

246
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:41,027
You're the hottest girl in here.
The hottest.

247
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:46,815
Okay, look, I'm only gonna be
here like an hour, an hour tops.

248
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,199
You know? You text
me and we'll go.

249
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:51,365
We're just gonna go.
Just me and you. Okay.

250
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,883
Oh, my... Okay. Sorry. Oh.

251
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,540
What happened?
Nothing.

252
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:01,747
I'll see ya later, okay?

253
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,560
Elody's really
embarrassing herself.

254
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:19,557
Elody's a slut.

255
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,685
Lindsay's a bitch
and a drama queen.

256
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,690
I'm rich and have ADD.

257
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:25,693
Baes!

258
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:27,912
Bae!

259
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:31,658
Come on.
Oh, get in here, baby!

260
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:38,079
Patrick, will you go get me something
a little bit stronger than this beer?

261
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,455
What's the magic word?

262
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,747
Blowjob.

263
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,457
BRB.
Thank you.

264
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,554
Where have you been? I've been
looking everywhere for you.

265
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:47,682
Have you?
Yes!

266
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:48,878
Like in Patrick's mouth?

267
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,011
Oops.

268
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:55,431
What? Oh, she's so shitfaced!

269
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,811
No, you're shitfaced, shitface.

270
00:16:58,394 --> 00:17:00,944
I can't believe high
school's almost over.

271
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,188
Aw.

272
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:03,982
Well, actually, we did
it right, you know?

273
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:07,324
Kissed the hottest boys,
went to the sickest parties.

274
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,450
Do you think we'll
remember any of this?

275
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:17,075
I mean, like two years,
three years from now?

276
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,124
I won't even
remember this tomorrow.

277
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:33,302
Oh, my God.

278
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:34,805
What's she doing here?

279
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:49,897
Up.
Okay.

280
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:09,673
Hello, sweetie.
Is that your first drink?

281
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:12,926
You really should take it easy.

282
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,144
You're a bitch!

283
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:25,478
Excuse me?

284
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:27,685
Whoa.

285
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:30,074
You heard me.

286
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:35,279
You're a goddamn fetid bitch
just like your mother.

287
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,488
It's no wonder
Daddy left. Huh?

288
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:40,873
- You're a bitch, too.
- What?

289
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:41,964
You're a drunk.

290
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:44,367
And you...

291
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:48,521
You're just pathetic.
You know what?

292
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,165
We'd rather be bitches
than a psycho.

293
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,295
Yeah, psycho.

294
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:54,011
Have you noticed
that nobody likes you?

295
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:55,798
- Yeah, psycho.
- Psycho.

296
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:57,756
Has anyone at this party...

297
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:59,449
- Has anyone talked to you?
- I don't think so.

298
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:00,933
You weren't even invited.

299
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:02,516
That's 'cause you're a freak.

300
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:03,808
Go back to the ward.

301
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,194
Go home.

302
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:09,065
Go home.

303
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,910
Get off me! Get off me!

304
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,658
Who are you?

305
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:21,452
You're the bitch!

306
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:26,457
Psycho!

307
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:28,376
Psycho!

308
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,341
Get this bitch on a leash!

309
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:32,421
Psycho!

310
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:33,506
You wanna go?

311
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:35,973
Freak, get out of here!

312
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:42,888
Go!

313
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:53,612
Go back to the ward,
you psycho bitch!

314
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,030
Are you okay?

315
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,624
What the hell
was that about, huh?

316
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,539
I don't know. She just
called us bitches...

317
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:11,688
What did she do?
In front of everybody.

318
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,189
So you attack her?
Okay. This is not my fault!

319
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,399
You gang up
and pour beer all over her?

320
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:15,423
You know what...

321
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:19,046
Who are you? Come on...
Do not touch me.

322
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,907
You know, your boyfriend's
throwing up in my sink.

323
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,211
So, you wanna take care of that?

324
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:36,736
Come on. Come on!

325
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:51,379
That was insane.

326
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,553
I'm sorry about Rob, bae.

327
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,089
Music!

328
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:01,967
Pacific Northwest, my ass.
I hate this weather.

329
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:05,144
Do you guys wanna get some food?
I really need carbs.

330
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,017
You sound like my grandmother.

331
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,935
Meh.
Here.

332
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,269
Oh, I like this song.

333
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:55,731
She called us bitches.

334
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,820
I guess we are.

335
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,283
What time is it?

336
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,833
Did you see
that look in her eyes?

337
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,120
- I mean, she just snapped.
- Yeah.

338
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:10,786
She freaked me out.

339
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:39,321
Sam, you're 20 minutes late!
Let's shake it, sister!

340
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:12,885
Sammy, you like the bird
I made you?

341
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:14,771
Mommy says you have to get up.

342
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:16,058
It's Saturday.

343
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,355
Mommy, Sammy won't get up!

344
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,403
Don't make me come up there.

345
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:45,681
Yeah?

346
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,179
Sexy lady!

347
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:50,434
What are you doing?

348
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:53,234
I'm so sorry. I had a nightmare,
so it's a slow start.

349
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:55,349
Um...

350
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:57,852
What happened last night?

351
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:03,694
Oh. Sorry. I was FaceTiming
with Patrick till, like, 3:00.

352
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:06,532
Speaking of which,

353
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,869
are you nervous for tonight?

354
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
What?

355
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,704
You, Rob, his flannel sheets?

356
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:18,082
I'm gonna shower.

357
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,631
Nope, no time. Come on.

358
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:20,751
It's Cupid Day.

359
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,137
Whoo!

360
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:44,651
Seriously?

361
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:47,213
Okay, this was maybe funny the
first bazillion times you did it.

362
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:48,487
It's still funny.

363
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:51,615
Yeah, baby!

364
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,330
Nice tits!

365
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,332
Ooh. I have your present.

366
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:04,419
No glove, no love.
You hear me?

367
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:06,046
It goes on him.

368
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:21,607
Sisyphus, not an STD.

369
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:24,191
All right. Keep it down.
Keep it down, people.

370
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,028
It's so beautiful.

371
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:32,574
I'm in heteronormative hell.

372
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:34,487
Thank you, girls. Thank you.

373
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,746
Okay, okay, let's hope
third time's the charm.

374
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:38,502
Yo, Sam.

375
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,014
Oh, man.

376
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:49,879
Sam, you forgot this one.

377
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,546
No, I didn't forget it.

378
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:52,675
What do you mean?

379
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:53,863
The more roses
you get on Cupid Day,

380
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:54,947
the more popular you are, right?

381
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,141
Thanks for the tip, Kent.
Noted.

382
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:59,201
Well, I didn't say
the rose was from me.

383
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:06,652
But it is from you, right?

384
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:09,692
Well...

385
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,485
Anyway, my mom is out of town...

386
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:16,244
Out of town and
you're having a party?

387
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:19,078
Yeah. Do you
wanna come? Or...

388
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:20,162
I have to go.

389
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:22,707
Well, see you tonight? Or...

390
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:45,479
Are you nervous?

391
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,691
No, no, no, no, no.

392
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:52,258
You don't want to waste the first
night you go full womanhood.

393
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,870
Okay, you sure they look good?

394
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,302
I just really don't want to look
like I'm trying too hard, you know?

395
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:00,076
You're fine.

396
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:04,956
Such a weird day.

397
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,750
Like how?

398
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:08,585
Just weird.

399
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,510
I feel like I'm still dreaming
from yesterday, like...

400
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:16,010
Or maybe yesterday was the dream.
I don't know... Whoa.

401
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:18,604
You're awake now!
No, no, no, no!

402
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,807
Sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Don't. Don't do that.

403
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:38,122
Oh, my God, there's so many
hot guys here tonight!

404
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:57,143
I'm gonna go find Patrick, okay?

405
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:58,218
What?

406
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:00,511
I'll be right back!

407
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:05,314
Sam! Hey, you made it!

408
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:13,897
Sam. Sam.

409
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:19,068
Oh, I am sorry.
Let me get that for you.

410
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:20,577
Rob, I need to talk to you.
What?

411
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:21,738
About what? What's up?

412
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:23,286
I'm feeling pranked.

413
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:25,264
Tonight was supposed to be
our special night...

414
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:27,458
No, no, no, no, no. Rob?
What?

415
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:31,040
I don't feel good.
I'm freaking out.

416
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,208
It's always something.
Can we go talk some...

417
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:36,667
It's always something.
Where?

418
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:41,008
Okay, Sam. Okay. I'm gonna
fill my cup up first.

419
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:43,136
Five minutes. Can
you wait that long?

420
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,298
This room is off limits.

421
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:03,296
I was just looking
for the bathroom.

422
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:04,508
Sorry.

423
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:08,308
I feel like I'm having Déjà
vu with you being in my room.

424
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:12,015
Oh, my God, I've been having
Déjà vu all day long.

425
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:17,364
Are you okay?

426
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:22,952
Yeah. Excuse me.

427
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:25,782
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

428
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:27,617
Yeah?
In Patrick's mouth, maybe.

429
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:34,420
You seem a little guilty.
Were you with Rob, you hussy?

430
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:36,171
Skank.
Harlot.

431
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:37,632
Hey, are you guys
talking about me?

432
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:39,148
You know what?
I think I'm gonna go home.

433
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:40,592
No, no, no!
What?

434
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,318
You don't have to drive me.
It's okay. I'll find a ride.

435
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:44,302
No, we just got here.
I'm confused.

436
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:47,005
I thought you were supposed
to get it on with Rob tonight.

437
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:48,136
Yeah.

438
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:51,939
Yeah, I changed my mind.

439
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:53,898
Well, at least I'm not
gonna be the only virgin.

440
00:30:57,023 --> 00:31:00,073
Oh, my God.

441
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,486
What's she doing here?

442
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:07,783
Watch this.

443
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:16,134
Is that your first drink?

444
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:22,672
You're a bitch!

445
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:24,796
Just like your mother.

446
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:27,603
No wonder Daddy left. Huh?

447
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:30,392
- You're a bitch, too.
- What?

448
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:31,523
You're a drunk.

449
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,849
And you...

450
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:36,019
You're just pathetic.

451
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,234
Juliet...

452
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:39,291
You know what? We'd rather
be bitches than a psycho.

453
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:40,315
Yeah, psycho.

454
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,070
Have you noticed
that nobody likes you?

455
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:44,152
- Yeah, psycho.
- Psycho.

456
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:46,284
Has anyone at this party...

457
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:47,883
- Has anyone talked to you?
- I don't think so.

458
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:50,327
- Go back to the ward.
- Go home.

459
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,409
Go home.

460
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:58,628
Get off me!

461
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:06,131
Go to hell!

462
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,389
Freak, get out of here!

463
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:10,595
Get the fuck out!

464
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:14,137
Get this bitch on a leash!

465
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:16,305
Psycho! Psycho.
You wanna go?

466
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:23,443
Go back to the ward,
you psycho bitch!

467
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:33,345
What do you think
people will say about you

468
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:34,619
when you die?

469
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:36,334
Like I care.
I'm serious.

470
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:37,464
That we're hot.

471
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,080
This shit is morbid, Sam.

472
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:40,667
Hey, watch the road.
Hey.

473
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:42,187
We need music.
You watch the road.

474
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:44,171
Guys, I'll find a song.

475
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:45,665
I want to help you pick a song.

476
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:47,007
Okay, mom.

477
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:48,131
Guys, wait.
Don't elbow me.

478
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:49,587
Just pick something.

479
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:52,757
You're trouble.
You always have to pee.

480
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:54,427
'Cause she drinks too much.

481
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:56,675
That, and she has the
bladder of a baby squirrel.

482
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:08,735
The truck.

483
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:10,374
Truck?

484
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:12,448
Watch out for the truck.
What truck?

485
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:28,678
How did you...

486
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:40,099
<i>It wasn't a dream.
It really happened. Again.</i>

487
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:11,132
Sammy, you like the bird
I made you?

488
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:12,717
It's origami.

489
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:14,892
Mommy says you have to get up.

490
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:16,061
Tell Mom I'm sick.

491
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:20,484
You don't feel hot.
Stop it.

492
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:31,204
Let go!

493
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:35,489
Mommy, Sammy won't get up!

494
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:41,035
<i>It wasn't until then</i>

495
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:43,252
<i>that I allowed myself
to think the worst.</i>

496
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:44,332
Sam?

497
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:46,611
What's this about you
feeling sick?

498
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,009
I just don't feel good.

499
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,126
On Cupid Day?

500
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:00,346
Did something happen?

501
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:04,598
I don't know.

502
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:08,521
Did you and Rob have a fight?

503
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:11,238
No. Mom, go away.

504
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,661
Please don't use that tone.
I'm just trying to help.

505
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:16,339
I just need to sleep
a little bit longer.

506
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,332
Please?

507
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:24,124
Okay. Well, I'll let Lindsay
know that you're going in late.

508
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:26,037
But I have to be
at work by 10:00.

509
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:05,044
Thank you for driving me.

510
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:06,752
Sure.

511
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,838
Sammy...
Hmm.

512
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,800
You'll feel better once you
see some of your roses.

513
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:21,715
I don't know. Maybe.

514
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:27,524
Well, you're lucky
to be so popular.

515
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:31,233
When I was a senior,
I hadn't even kissed a boy.

516
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:33,729
Everyone said my eyes
were too close together

517
00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:35,438
and that I looked like a fish.

518
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:39,277
Yeah.

519
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:49,834
I have to get to work, honey.

520
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:52,672
I think you're beautiful.

521
00:36:57,967 --> 00:36:59,797
Go.
Bye.

522
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:19,656
<i>Maybe everything was connected.</i>

523
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:25,704
<i>Maybe a flock of birds
could cause a rainstorm</i>

524
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:28,538
<i>and everything done
could be undone.</i>

525
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,880
<i>Maybe things could change.</i>

526
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:40,434
<i>And maybe I could change them.</i>

527
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:49,685
It's Rob.
We're having issues.

528
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,057
But it's the day.

529
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:55,020
The note in his
Val-a-gram said "Love ya."

530
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:57,992
"L-U-V ya. Luv ya."

531
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:00,005
What is that? We've been
going out since last year.

532
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:04,029
Yeah. Well, you know, maybe he's just
waiting to say it, like, tonight.

533
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:05,385
I'm not gonna have sex with him

534
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,289
just so that he says
"I love you."

535
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,370
I'm not gonna do that.

536
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:11,622
We go out every weekend. Mmm.

537
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:13,207
I don't know.
I wanna stay in.

538
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:14,594
Like we used to.

539
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,300
Okay, but the only reason
we stayed in

540
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:18,969
was because we weren't invited
to any senior parties.

541
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:24,643
I just, bottom line, don't want to
have to deal with that today. Okay?

542
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:30,225
Okay.

543
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:31,476
All right.

544
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:33,231
What are you doing?

545
00:38:34,772 --> 00:38:36,072
- What is she...
- Don't worry.

546
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:38,651
Are you texting...

547
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:39,784
Oh, my God.

548
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,950
That devilish grin, though.

549
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:46,077
Oh, my God.

550
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:47,909
What? What?

551
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:49,930
Why did he give me that...
What did you say?

552
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:53,044
Relax, I just told him
that you got your period.

553
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:55,978
That's a good one. Yes.
That's perfect.

554
00:38:57,753 --> 00:38:59,633
- You're welcome!
- That's a good one.

555
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:02,335
Lock up the knives and babies!

556
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:03,527
Does it smell like pee in here?

557
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:04,611
Yeah, I can smell her from here.

558
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:06,505
Remind me again.
Why do we hate Juliet?

559
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,310
Are you serious?

560
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:13,102
We don't hate her. It's just she's super
creepy with all those weird drawings.

561
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:15,687
Remember Mellow Yellow
in the fifth grade?

562
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:16,771
Oh, my God.

563
00:39:16,814 --> 00:39:19,114
When Lindsay found out that
she peed in her sleeping bag

564
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,571
on the Girl Scout trip.

565
00:39:22,153 --> 00:39:24,033
Why do you care all of a sudden?

566
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:25,993
You know she should be
institutionalized.

567
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:29,446
I was just wondering.
That's all.

568
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:34,850
So, we're going over
to your house, right?

569
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:36,004
Obviously.

570
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:38,633
Can I borrow something?

571
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:40,961
Always. I got you.

572
00:39:57,563 --> 00:40:00,653
Hey. Uh, these came for you
in Daimler's class.

573
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:02,605
I know I'm not wearing
the appropriate attire,

574
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:04,953
but I promise
they're legitimate.

575
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:08,236
Cool.

576
00:40:08,324 --> 00:40:10,624
Also, uh, this rose
came for you.

577
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:18,665
It's kind of like
a painting of a rose.

578
00:40:18,793 --> 00:40:20,793
You know, it stands out
in front of all the others.

579
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:25,343
Thank you.

580
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:28,434
Hey, I never said
that it was from me.

581
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:32,852
But, whoever it was from, they put
a lot of thought into it. So...

582
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:39,516
By the way, my mom is
out of town this weekend,

583
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:41,437
so I'm gonna throw
a big party tonight.

584
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:42,534
Yeah.

585
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,290
Did you remember the address?
Or do you...

586
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:45,318
Hey, Sam.

587
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:49,868
It was third grade, so you
probably don't remember.

588
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:53,787
But do you, uh... You
think you'll come? Or...

589
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,999
No, I can't. Sorry.

590
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:58,205
Oh, come on.

591
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:01,792
Well, I'm... I could have
crutches on call for you,

592
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,677
in case you want to climb
up the tree... Kent.

593
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:05,796
And play flying squirrel.
That was one time.

594
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:08,631
Look, I'm just saying. I'm prepared.
I'm prepared.

595
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:11,047
Okay, glad to hear it.
So, that's a maybe, or...

596
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:14,806
I don't think so.

597
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,600
Well, I'll take
that "No" as a "Maybe."

598
00:41:16,684 --> 00:41:19,154
So, maybe I'll see you tonight.

599
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:35,083
Oh, God.

600
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:37,748
Juliet Sykes
just arrived at the party.

601
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:38,830
Gross.

602
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:41,424
Yeah. The worst.
I'm so glad we didn't go.

603
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:46,088
Mmm. Snapchat alert. Rob is totally
puking in the kitchen sink.

604
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:47,172
Oh, I want to see that.

605
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:49,046
I wanna see that.

606
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:50,722
Of course he is.

607
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:53,046
I don't wanna see it.
It's gross. Ew.

608
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:55,638
You kiss that?

609
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:58,493
I can't believe you made
this ice cream, Ally.

610
00:41:58,517 --> 00:41:59,703
It's literally better
than a restaurant's.

611
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:01,227
No, it's true.
I mean, you should

612
00:42:01,312 --> 00:42:02,772
go to cooking school.
Screw college.

613
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:04,685
Thanks, guys.
It has no dairy.

614
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:06,823
Oh, you're so full of shit.

615
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:08,192
Thirty-eight.

616
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:10,357
- Okay.
- You can shut up now.

617
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:11,696
What?

618
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:15,203
Matt's at the party.

619
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:16,604
Ally, you say "Matt"
one more time

620
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,980
and I will kill you
in your sleep.

621
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:19,288
I will kill you in your sleep.

622
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:20,961
I will kill you in your sleep.

623
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:26,088
12:39.

624
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:53,026
I wonder what filter
Terri uses on her photos.

625
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:54,493
Major Fomo.

626
00:42:54,573 --> 00:42:55,743
Such a loser.

627
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,621
Ugh, Steve's flirting
with a freshman.

628
00:42:57,826 --> 00:42:58,946
I love you guys.

629
00:43:00,913 --> 00:43:02,753
Aw, Sam...

630
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,291
We love you, too.

631
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,590
Aw, we love you, Sam.
Weirdo.

632
00:43:13,259 --> 00:43:14,719
Don't go emo on us.

633
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,989
Shit. Where's my phone?

634
00:43:42,288 --> 00:43:43,708
Juliet Sykes is dead.

635
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:01,555
She killed herself.

636
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:07,562
But nothing happened
to her at the party.

637
00:44:08,522 --> 00:44:11,152
How totally insane.

638
00:44:20,242 --> 00:44:21,962
Could our rose have
something to do with it?

639
00:44:22,411 --> 00:44:23,541
Don't be stupid.

640
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:29,418
God, imagine how
her family feels.

641
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:31,501
Look, you can't be mean
to someone forever

642
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:33,347
and then just feel badly
when they die, okay?

643
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,840
We all knew she was crazy.

644
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:39,391
God, Lindsay, she was your
best friend in fifth grade.

645
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:43,429
Yeah, I remember you used
to sleep over at her house.

646
00:44:43,557 --> 00:44:46,847
Yeah, well, that was before
she became a sociopath, Ally.

647
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:48,265
I'm going back to sleep.

648
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,620
I'm going to sleep in my room.

649
00:45:05,412 --> 00:45:06,962
I'm going with her.

650
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:16,840
You were friends with Juliet?

651
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:22,392
No one even talked
to you in fifth grade,

652
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:24,471
and I don't hold that
against you.

653
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:30,229
You never said anything.

654
00:45:32,648 --> 00:45:33,917
We made fun of her
for all these years...

655
00:45:33,941 --> 00:45:35,151
It's not our fault.

656
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:52,285
Go to sleep.

657
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:55,226
<i>- I did everything right.
- And nothing changed.</i>

658
00:47:05,824 --> 00:47:08,584
<i>I woke up this mornin'</i>

659
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:12,160
<i>Didn't recognize
the boy in the mirror</i>

660
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:16,037
<i>Then I laughed and I said
Oh silly me, that's just me</i>

661
00:47:16,335 --> 00:47:20,915
<i>Then I proceeded to brush
some stranger's teeth</i>

662
00:47:21,048 --> 00:47:24,298
<i>But they were my teeth
and I was weightless</i>

663
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:27,514
<i>Just quivering like some leaf
come in the window of a restroom</i>

664
00:47:27,596 --> 00:47:31,556
<i>I couldn't tell you what the
hell it was supposed to mean</i>

665
00:47:31,642 --> 00:47:34,312
<i>'Cause it was a Monday,
no, a Tuesday</i>

666
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:36,944
<i>No, a Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday</i>

667
00:47:37,022 --> 00:47:40,282
<i>Then I woke up this mornin'</i>

668
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,177
<i>The day starts
and ends the same,</i>

669
00:48:05,259 --> 00:48:07,389
<i>regardless of anything
I do or say.</i>

670
00:48:09,555 --> 00:48:11,215
<i>If that's how it works,</i>

671
00:48:11,306 --> 00:48:14,386
<i>I'm gonna do and say
whatever I want.</i>

672
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,346
Oh, no, you're not wearing
that to school.

673
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:34,410
My Cupid Day outfit.

674
00:48:34,496 --> 00:48:36,599
Yeah, well, you don't want to
give people the wrong idea.

675
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:37,753
What idea is that exactly?

676
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:40,093
No, this is not happening. Go
back up and change, please.

677
00:48:40,544 --> 00:48:43,214
This is my life. I'll do whatever
the hell I want with it.

678
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:46,234
Dan, can you just jump in here, please?
Look, Sam...

679
00:48:46,258 --> 00:48:48,588
That's so disrespectful to
talk to your mom... Hey, Sam!

680
00:48:48,677 --> 00:48:50,507
Here... I told you not
to touch my stuff!

681
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:52,467
That's it!
You are grounded!

682
00:48:52,806 --> 00:48:56,136
Grounded?
I'm already grounded.

683
00:48:59,688 --> 00:49:00,688
Samantha!

684
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:05,364
<i>Maybe I was dead and in hell.</i>

685
00:49:05,444 --> 00:49:08,454
<i>Maybe I was alive and in hell.</i>

686
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,870
<i>But it didn't matter.</i>

687
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:12,579
<i>Nothing mattered anymore.</i>

688
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:18,289
What are you wearing?

689
00:49:19,124 --> 00:49:20,334
Funny.

690
00:49:22,294 --> 00:49:23,344
Excuse me.

691
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,550
Jeez, wake up on the wrong
side of the bed or something?

692
00:49:27,674 --> 00:49:28,884
For a few days now, yep.

693
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:31,217
Nice tits!

694
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:34,221
What happened to Sam?

695
00:49:34,473 --> 00:49:37,483
Uh, someone forgot to take her
happy pills this morning.

696
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:38,559
I took mine.

697
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:41,095
Well, I know something
that'll cheer you right up.

698
00:49:41,188 --> 00:49:43,648
I swear to God, ELODY, if you
hand me a condom right now...

699
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:48,485
But it's your present.
For your special night.

700
00:49:49,363 --> 00:49:50,363
Take it.

701
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:53,736
Unless you want to be
a walking STD farm.

702
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:56,238
You would know.

703
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:02,537
At least I'm not still a virgin.

704
00:50:03,377 --> 00:50:04,957
What the hell is wrong with you?

705
00:50:06,088 --> 00:50:07,458
What did you just say to me?

706
00:50:07,756 --> 00:50:09,796
What is it? Do you feel like
you need to prove to us

707
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:11,513
that you don't give a shit?

708
00:50:11,593 --> 00:50:13,433
Is that what it is?

709
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:15,531
'Cause guess what? You don't
need to prove anything.

710
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:19,015
We all know that you don't give a
damn about anybody but yourself.

711
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:20,941
We're all pretty
fucking clear on that!

712
00:50:21,144 --> 00:50:22,944
What the hell is
your problem today, Sam?

713
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:25,271
You guys, don't fight.
Just drop it.

714
00:50:25,357 --> 00:50:26,567
What, you don't agree?

715
00:50:26,775 --> 00:50:27,775
Leave her out of it.

716
00:50:27,901 --> 00:50:31,451
Why? You're the one who talks shit
about both of them all the time.

717
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:34,451
"Look at ELODY
climbing all over Steve.

718
00:50:34,533 --> 00:50:36,373
"He doesn't even like her.
Look at Ally.

719
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:38,701
"Oh, my God!
She's such a know-it-all.

720
00:50:38,787 --> 00:50:40,497
"She just loves
the sound of her own voice.

721
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,058
"Hope ELODY doesn't
puke in my car again

722
00:50:42,082 --> 00:50:43,442
"and make it smell
like alcoholic."

723
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,790
Stop it, Sam.

724
00:50:48,922 --> 00:50:49,922
Out.

725
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:52,429
Get out!

726
00:50:53,593 --> 00:50:54,763
Now!

727
00:50:59,975 --> 00:51:02,685
I'd love to hear what you say
about me behind my back.

728
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:27,134
Sisyphus, not an STD.

729
00:51:30,964 --> 00:51:31,974
Don't say it.

730
00:51:35,343 --> 00:51:37,103
I'm in heteronormative hell.

731
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:41,932
Okay, thank you.
Thank you, girls. Thank you.

732
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:45,267
Okay, okay, let's hope third
time's the charm. Okay?

733
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:47,231
Sisyphus.

734
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:50,530
Sam! What?

735
00:51:51,193 --> 00:51:52,283
You can take 'em.

736
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,200
Oh, Sam, you're breaking
hearts left and right.

737
00:52:00,327 --> 00:52:02,197
Am I breaking yours,
Mr. Daimler?

738
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:05,539
What?

739
00:52:07,459 --> 00:52:10,379
Your heart, am I breaking it?

740
00:52:19,471 --> 00:52:22,061
No. You're not.

741
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:24,642
My patience, however,
is at its breaking point.

742
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,560
Take a seat. Please.

743
00:52:28,188 --> 00:52:29,608
If you insist.

744
00:52:35,362 --> 00:52:38,242
Okay. Sisyphus.

745
00:52:39,825 --> 00:52:40,865
Sisyphus.

746
00:52:42,244 --> 00:52:44,504
Why is our friend Sisyphus
still relevant today?

747
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:46,869
Why is the story
still relevant today?

748
00:53:07,936 --> 00:53:09,346
Don't even think about it.

749
00:53:10,105 --> 00:53:13,015
Turn around.
That way.

750
00:53:13,108 --> 00:53:14,108
Bye.

751
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:12,829
<i>Get this bitch out of here!</i>

752
00:54:13,752 --> 00:54:14,752
Psycho!

753
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:24,351
What the hell?
Shit.

754
00:54:24,471 --> 00:54:26,181
What are you doing in here?

755
00:54:29,768 --> 00:54:31,938
This is my bathroom.

756
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,029
Nice shoes.

757
00:54:40,654 --> 00:54:41,704
Hard to walk in, huh?

758
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:43,990
I can walk in them
just fine, thank you.

759
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:46,235
Aw, you need a pair of these.

760
00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:48,789
Comfiest shoes I ever owned.

761
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:49,870
Really?

762
00:54:50,163 --> 00:54:52,043
All right, your loss.
Whatever.

763
00:54:52,165 --> 00:54:54,535
You wanna trade?

764
00:54:54,626 --> 00:54:56,206
Like, switch shoes?

765
00:54:57,545 --> 00:55:00,045
Come on, Kingston. See if I
can get in those without...

766
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:01,171
Just get out.

767
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:02,877
Hurting myself.
Come on, let's try it.

768
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:04,891
Why not?
What?

769
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:06,181
Yeah, let's do it.

770
00:55:07,514 --> 00:55:08,684
Come on!

771
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:11,888
Why do you guys hate me so much?

772
00:55:16,189 --> 00:55:19,149
I know you know what's written
in this bathroom somewhere.

773
00:55:22,904 --> 00:55:24,414
It's AC...

774
00:55:26,408 --> 00:55:29,488
Equals...
BD, right?

775
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:32,867
Anna Cartulo equals bull dyke.

776
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,420
Or maybe it's
"biggest douchebag."

777
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:42,170
But I reckon that honor definitely
belongs to Lindsay Edgecomb.

778
00:55:48,096 --> 00:55:49,386
So, is that it?

779
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:53,805
'Cause I'm gay?

780
00:55:55,729 --> 00:55:56,939
I don't know.

781
00:55:59,232 --> 00:56:00,584
Isn't that how
it always works out?

782
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:03,448
There's somebody laughing, there's
somebody being laughed at.

783
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:07,280
Right.

784
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:10,294
Look, whatever.

785
00:56:10,368 --> 00:56:15,788
Really. I mean, this whole high
school thing's just a blip.

786
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,630
I'm not gonna remember
any of you.

787
00:56:23,965 --> 00:56:25,215
I win.

788
00:56:31,097 --> 00:56:35,137
Do you ever feel like you're living
the same day over and over again

789
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:39,436
with only, like, a few
things being different?

790
00:56:43,902 --> 00:56:47,492
Oh, shit, Samantha. You just
described my whole life!

791
00:56:56,706 --> 00:56:58,496
Hey, what's up?

792
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:28,987
Hey, Sam.

793
00:57:29,072 --> 00:57:31,322
Did you have to ask
permission to talk to me?

794
00:57:33,076 --> 00:57:35,946
Lindsay's just really upset
about what you said.

795
00:57:36,037 --> 00:57:37,327
You should apologize.

796
00:57:37,831 --> 00:57:40,421
Well, everything that
I said was true, so...

797
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,130
It doesn't matter if it's true.

798
00:57:43,128 --> 00:57:46,048
She's Lindsay. She's ours.
We're each other's, you know?

799
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,840
Just apologize.

800
00:57:47,924 --> 00:57:49,974
You're not listening to me.
I'm not sorry.

801
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:51,341
Please, Sam?

802
00:57:52,512 --> 00:57:55,102
Why do you care so much, ELODY?

803
00:57:57,058 --> 00:58:00,598
Because...
You guys are all I have.

804
00:58:17,829 --> 00:58:20,079
Are you still trying
to turn her against me?

805
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,920
You're the horrible driver.

806
00:58:28,006 --> 00:58:30,546
You're the one always criticizing
people and hurting people.

807
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:32,528
You're the one who lied about
being friends with her

808
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:34,262
and then tortured her
for all these years.

809
00:58:34,387 --> 00:58:36,177
I just followed along and yet...

810
00:58:40,476 --> 00:58:42,146
I'm the one paying for it.

811
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:46,475
Sam, what are you talking about?

812
00:58:46,608 --> 00:58:48,688
Whoa. What?

813
00:58:49,194 --> 00:58:52,074
Oh, my God.

814
00:58:59,037 --> 00:59:01,867
Sam, I haven't seen you in, like, forever.
Where have you...

815
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,730
Get this bitch on a leash!

816
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:30,815
I love you. Is that what
you wanted to hear?

817
00:59:30,902 --> 00:59:33,782
Go back to the ward,
you psycho bitch!

818
01:00:01,182 --> 01:00:02,892
Sam?

819
01:00:20,702 --> 01:00:22,252
Hey, are you okay?

820
01:00:25,081 --> 01:00:29,131
Obviously, you're crying. But
is there something I can do?

821
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:31,130
I'll get you a tissue.
Yeah, yeah.

822
01:00:34,632 --> 01:00:35,762
Thanks.
Yeah.

823
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:46,725
Sorry I'm in your room.
I know there's a sign.

824
01:00:46,811 --> 01:00:49,311
No. Don't worry about it.

825
01:00:49,939 --> 01:00:51,569
The sign's just really
for other people,

826
01:00:51,649 --> 01:00:52,979
so they don't get in my stuff.

827
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:57,359
It's the first big party
I've ever had, so...

828
01:00:58,489 --> 01:01:00,069
Why'd you have one now?

829
01:01:03,536 --> 01:01:05,706
I figured if I had a party,
you'd come.

830
01:01:15,882 --> 01:01:17,012
I like your room.

831
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:20,301
Yeah? It's my dad's
old den.

832
01:01:21,846 --> 01:01:23,676
It must get a lot of light.

833
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:24,765
Yeah.

834
01:01:25,308 --> 01:01:28,688
It's like waking up
in the middle of the sun.

835
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,610
I get to see the old tree.

836
01:01:33,441 --> 01:01:36,611
I like it.
It's constant.

837
01:01:39,197 --> 01:01:40,617
Is that the one
we used to sit in?

838
01:01:42,283 --> 01:01:44,293
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

839
01:01:45,828 --> 01:01:48,538
Do you remember climbing up it?

840
01:01:48,956 --> 01:01:51,286
And then you jumped down
and sprained your ankle?

841
01:01:52,043 --> 01:01:53,423
I was stupid.

842
01:01:55,171 --> 01:01:56,671
It was very ambitious.

843
01:01:59,801 --> 01:02:00,891
I should go.
Hey, hey, hey.

844
01:02:00,968 --> 01:02:04,178
Hey. Just stay for
a second. Okay?

845
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:11,350
I can drive you home or...

846
01:02:11,479 --> 01:02:12,979
I don't want to go home.

847
01:02:16,401 --> 01:02:18,491
Okay, well, you can, uh...

848
01:02:18,569 --> 01:02:20,699
You could crash here
if you want.

849
01:02:22,156 --> 01:02:24,156
Not, like, with me.

850
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:27,749
Somewhere else.
I'll be somewhere else.

851
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:31,830
Bed completely to yourself.

852
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:33,919
The Kent McFuller master suite.

853
01:02:39,382 --> 01:02:40,382
Yeah?

854
01:02:41,676 --> 01:02:42,676
Okay.

855
01:02:44,178 --> 01:02:46,508
Hey, it's okay.

856
01:02:54,272 --> 01:02:55,312
Here.

857
01:03:06,033 --> 01:03:07,543
I'm sorry about earlier.

858
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:10,251
Don't worry about that.

859
01:03:10,371 --> 01:03:12,461
No, I'm sorry

860
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,500
I've always been so mean to you.

861
01:03:20,381 --> 01:03:22,471
Don't look.
Don't read it. Please?

862
01:03:22,717 --> 01:03:24,047
Why? It's...
It's something bad.

863
01:03:27,013 --> 01:03:28,063
Okay.

864
01:03:33,686 --> 01:03:35,146
Your skin's so hot.

865
01:03:35,563 --> 01:03:39,403
It's always like that.

866
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:56,250
I wish we could be here forever.

867
01:04:15,436 --> 01:04:16,766
Okay, let's try again.

868
01:04:22,276 --> 01:04:23,436
We're taking a day off.

869
01:04:24,487 --> 01:04:26,947
I think you're just
gonna drool around.

870
01:04:27,782 --> 01:04:28,782
What is it?

871
01:04:28,908 --> 01:04:31,448
And then you're just gonna go
through there and then like that.

872
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:34,789
<i>If I was going to relive the
same day over and over,</i>

873
01:04:36,332 --> 01:04:38,462
<i>I wanted it to be a worthy day.</i>

874
01:04:46,926 --> 01:04:48,256
<i>But not just for me.</i>

875
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:08,632
Do the kids at school
ever make fun of you

876
01:05:08,656 --> 01:05:09,816
for the way that you talk?

877
01:05:12,994 --> 01:05:14,164
Sometimes.

878
01:05:16,872 --> 01:05:18,372
<i>You can do something about that.</i>

879
01:05:20,543 --> 01:05:22,463
<i>You know, you can learn
to talk differently.</i>

880
01:05:23,588 --> 01:05:26,628
But this is my voice. How will
kids even know it's me talking?

881
01:05:29,218 --> 01:05:30,468
When I was in the fifth grade,

882
01:05:30,553 --> 01:05:35,353
this girl used to
sing this song.

883
01:05:36,684 --> 01:05:39,524
<i>She smells like manure
and she lived in the sewer</i>

884
01:05:39,645 --> 01:05:41,515
<i>Samantha Kingston</i>

885
01:05:41,856 --> 01:05:43,146
Who did that?

886
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,150
Lindsay.

887
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:53,080
<i>How come you're so mean to Mom?</i>

888
01:05:57,872 --> 01:05:59,122
I'm not mean to Mom.

889
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:02,081
You drew a line on the
floor with nail polish

890
01:06:02,168 --> 01:06:03,838
and said she couldn't cross it.

891
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:07,008
Mom and I had a fight,

892
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:08,549
and I was mad at her
in the moment,

893
01:06:08,633 --> 01:06:10,013
but I didn't...

894
01:06:12,178 --> 01:06:14,718
I didn't think that
she'd actually stay away.

895
01:06:21,354 --> 01:06:22,364
<i>Look at that.</i>

896
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:24,082
That's just the outside,
how pretty it was.

897
01:06:24,106 --> 01:06:25,396
Oh, my gosh.
Look at you guys.

898
01:06:25,524 --> 01:06:27,944
- Can you send those to me?
- Aw!

899
01:06:28,069 --> 01:06:29,859
So cute!
Those are beautiful.

900
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:32,029
Remember when you used to
come here all the time?

901
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:33,663
I do. Of course.

902
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:37,369
Then your daughter
got too cool, so...

903
01:06:37,745 --> 01:06:39,575
I'm just kidding. Can
we go watch the pizza?

904
01:06:39,747 --> 01:06:42,077
Okay. Wait, tiger.

905
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:49,008
I'm glad we did this.

906
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:52,890
Yeah. It was really sweet
what you did today.

907
01:06:58,265 --> 01:06:59,805
Do you think I'm a good person?

908
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:05,560
Of course I think
you're a good person.

909
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:08,610
But it doesn't
really matter what I think.

910
01:07:08,734 --> 01:07:10,534
I mean, what's important
is what you think.

911
01:07:10,611 --> 01:07:13,031
No, I'm serious.
I want to know...

912
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:16,621
Why do you think
that I'm a good person?

913
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:25,877
Do you remember when
you were a little girl?

914
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:29,210
You used to take turns riding
all of the horses in the stable

915
01:07:29,296 --> 01:07:31,416
so that none of them
would feel left out?

916
01:07:32,216 --> 01:07:33,466
Do you remember that?

917
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:35,474
I do.
Mmm-hmm.

918
01:07:37,555 --> 01:07:40,635
But I was a little girl.
It's different.

919
01:07:41,934 --> 01:07:44,814
But you have a big heart, Sam.
That doesn't go away.

920
01:07:47,606 --> 01:07:48,816
One good thing.

921
01:07:48,899 --> 01:07:53,819
You just focus
on that one good thing,

922
01:07:53,904 --> 01:07:55,914
and you see where it leads you.

923
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:12,090
<i>How is it possible
to change so much</i>

924
01:08:12,173 --> 01:08:14,843
<i>and not be able to
change anything at all?</i>

925
01:08:22,767 --> 01:08:24,637
<i>I knew I had to do something.</i>

926
01:08:27,313 --> 01:08:28,483
<i>Something good.</i>

927
01:09:22,576 --> 01:09:23,576
You made it.

928
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:25,410
Oh. Sorry.

929
01:09:26,205 --> 01:09:27,745
The room's off limits.

930
01:09:28,082 --> 01:09:31,132
No. Forget the sign.
It's no big deal.

931
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:32,850
That's really just there
for other people,

932
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,840
so they don't mess
with my stuff.

933
01:09:36,006 --> 01:09:37,006
I'm glad you came.

934
01:09:37,091 --> 01:09:40,431
Yeah. I had to. I like what
you've done with the place.

935
01:09:40,511 --> 01:09:44,851
Yeah, this used to be
my dad's old den.

936
01:09:45,015 --> 01:09:48,135
Now it's the Kent McFuller
master suite.

937
01:09:49,687 --> 01:09:51,807
Yeah, not so good
in the morning, though.

938
01:09:54,066 --> 01:09:56,776
It's like waking up in...
In the middle of the sun.

939
01:10:01,699 --> 01:10:02,829
Yeah.

940
01:10:09,582 --> 01:10:11,792
I hope you don't think
that it's weird

941
01:10:11,876 --> 01:10:14,086
that I'm here
with you right now.

942
01:10:15,588 --> 01:10:17,128
Sam, um...

943
01:10:18,799 --> 01:10:22,509
I once wore Crocs
for 365 days straight,

944
01:10:22,595 --> 01:10:25,595
so I don't think
anything's weird.

945
01:10:26,473 --> 01:10:27,701
I forgot about your Crocs phase.

946
01:10:27,725 --> 01:10:28,845
Yeah.

947
01:10:36,775 --> 01:10:39,145
Why are you always
so nice to me?

948
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:51,583
Well, do you remember in third
grade right after my dad died?

949
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:57,633
We were in the cafeteria
and I was crying,

950
01:10:58,714 --> 01:11:03,934
and Phil Howe came up to
me, called me a baby,

951
01:11:04,011 --> 01:11:07,641
and then smacked my tray
right out of my hand,

952
01:11:07,723 --> 01:11:10,683
and food went flying everywhere.

953
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:13,413
I remember what
we were eating, too.

954
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:16,437
It was, um, mashed potatoes
and turkey burgers.

955
01:11:16,523 --> 01:11:20,363
And you came over,

956
01:11:20,444 --> 01:11:23,704
you scooped up the mashed
potatoes right off the ground

957
01:11:23,781 --> 01:11:26,951
and you went up to
Phil and you smashed

958
01:11:27,034 --> 01:11:28,834
the mashed potatoes
right in his face.

959
01:11:30,579 --> 01:11:34,039
And you then said, "You're
worse than a hot lunch,"

960
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:38,051
which, at the time,
was a really good insult.

961
01:11:38,712 --> 01:11:42,552
I mean, I didn't laugh
more that day than...

962
01:11:42,633 --> 01:11:43,883
I mean...

963
01:11:47,346 --> 01:11:53,306
It was the first time I laughed
since my dad died and I...

964
01:11:58,649 --> 01:12:00,479
Do you remember
what I said to you?

965
01:12:07,324 --> 01:12:08,874
"You're my hero."

966
01:12:09,827 --> 01:12:10,997
Yeah.

967
01:12:13,497 --> 01:12:16,577
And that day I vowed
to be your hero, too.

968
01:12:19,044 --> 01:12:20,594
No matter how long it took.

969
01:12:32,766 --> 01:12:34,096
Look, I'm sorry.

970
01:12:34,184 --> 01:12:37,864
No, don't do...
Don't be sorry. It's okay.

971
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:41,397
Good.

972
01:12:43,068 --> 01:12:44,698
'Cause I'm not really sorry.

973
01:13:08,552 --> 01:13:09,852
Shit.
Wait.

974
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:18,944
Sam! Hey!

975
01:13:19,438 --> 01:13:21,068
Sam, wait, I...

976
01:13:22,524 --> 01:13:24,234
Oh, my God,
Sam, did you see that?

977
01:13:25,486 --> 01:13:26,486
Hey, Sam.

978
01:13:27,321 --> 01:13:28,991
Did you see where Juliet went?

979
01:13:31,241 --> 01:13:32,331
Juliet, stop!

980
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,090
Juliet!

981
01:13:42,169 --> 01:13:44,249
Juliet! Wait!

982
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,180
Juliet!

983
01:13:59,937 --> 01:14:01,357
Juliet!

984
01:14:03,857 --> 01:14:05,187
Juliet!

985
01:14:15,536 --> 01:14:16,866
Juliet, wait!

986
01:14:40,519 --> 01:14:41,559
Juliet!

987
01:14:47,526 --> 01:14:48,526
Juliet!

988
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,410
Juliet!

989
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:05,787
Juliet!
What are you doing?

990
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:07,564
I know what happened back there.
Get away from me.

991
01:15:07,588 --> 01:15:08,731
And I feel really bad about it,

992
01:15:08,755 --> 01:15:09,899
and I know this may sound crazy,

993
01:15:09,923 --> 01:15:12,263
but I have a feeling I may
be able to understand you

994
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:13,842
better than you think
that I could.

995
01:15:13,927 --> 01:15:15,257
You hate me.

996
01:15:19,766 --> 01:15:21,436
I don't hate you.

997
01:15:22,269 --> 01:15:24,519
I know we haven't always
been the nicest to you,

998
01:15:24,605 --> 01:15:28,025
but the thing is that Lindsay
didn't mean anything by it.

999
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:29,419
We didn't know
what we were doing.

1000
01:15:29,443 --> 01:15:31,533
I used to be friends
with Lindsay.

1001
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:35,870
It was right before
her parents got divorced.

1002
01:15:35,949 --> 01:15:37,260
I used to sleep over
at her house.

1003
01:15:37,284 --> 01:15:39,454
Her parents would be
fighting so bad.

1004
01:15:41,288 --> 01:15:42,788
She was so upset.

1005
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:48,592
She was so upset, she
started wetting the bed.

1006
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:53,550
You remember the name you
all gave me in fifth grade?

1007
01:15:53,634 --> 01:15:55,474
The name Lindsay gave me?

1008
01:15:57,638 --> 01:15:58,928
"Mellow Yellow."

1009
01:16:00,015 --> 01:16:01,135
Remember that?

1010
01:16:02,017 --> 01:16:03,187
You remember the camping trip

1011
01:16:03,268 --> 01:16:05,148
when I supposedly peed
in my sleeping bag?

1012
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:06,480
It was Lindsay.

1013
01:16:07,481 --> 01:16:09,861
Lindsay's the one who peed.

1014
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:13,013
When everyone asked
what happened,

1015
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:14,570
she just pointed
her finger at me

1016
01:16:14,655 --> 01:16:16,485
and screamed,
"She did it."

1017
01:16:18,659 --> 01:16:19,659
Juliet...

1018
01:16:22,996 --> 01:16:24,286
Please let me help you.

1019
01:16:28,961 --> 01:16:31,051
It doesn't matter now.

1020
01:16:48,605 --> 01:16:49,855
Hey.

1021
01:16:51,316 --> 01:16:53,316
It's like your Val-a-gram
always said...

1022
01:16:55,862 --> 01:17:00,202
"Maybe next year, but...

1023
01:17:02,077 --> 01:17:03,537
"Probably not."

1024
01:17:05,247 --> 01:17:06,247
Juliet.

1025
01:17:51,084 --> 01:17:53,804
<i>For the first time,
when I wake up,</i>

1026
01:17:55,088 --> 01:18:01,638
<i>I'm not scared
or confused or angry.</i>

1027
01:18:07,225 --> 01:18:11,975
<i>Because, for the first time, I truly
understand what needs to happen.</i>

1028
01:18:23,492 --> 01:18:26,452
<i>I truly understand
how to live this day.</i>

1029
01:18:39,424 --> 01:18:40,804
Oh, thank you.
Yeah.

1030
01:18:40,884 --> 01:18:42,054
Want something to eat?

1031
01:18:43,804 --> 01:18:46,564
I'm good, thanks.
Lindsay's got it covered.

1032
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,180
Mom?
Oh.

1033
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:49,600
I love you.

1034
01:18:50,644 --> 01:18:51,654
I love you, too.

1035
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:56,320
What, no love for your old man?

1036
01:18:56,441 --> 01:18:58,111
I love you, too, old man.

1037
01:18:58,193 --> 01:19:00,283
Thank you.
Thank you.

1038
01:19:07,828 --> 01:19:09,578
Sammy, you forgot your gloves!

1039
01:19:10,247 --> 01:19:12,327
What would I do without you?

1040
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:17,670
Hey.

1041
01:19:19,965 --> 01:19:23,635
You are perfect
the way that you are, Fizzy.

1042
01:19:26,012 --> 01:19:27,432
Always remember that.

1043
01:19:38,817 --> 01:19:40,317
I can't breathe!

1044
01:19:56,543 --> 01:19:58,383
It's cold!
Yeah.

1045
01:20:39,252 --> 01:20:40,422
What are you doing?

1046
01:20:41,004 --> 01:20:44,224
Auditioning for a Tampax commercial?
Let's go.

1047
01:20:56,603 --> 01:20:57,853
Yeah, baby!

1048
01:20:59,606 --> 01:21:01,816
Nice tits! Get in!

1049
01:21:03,235 --> 01:21:04,235
Yes.

1050
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:06,400
You know how I like it.

1051
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,250
Hey, ELODY.

1052
01:21:16,289 --> 01:21:17,767
What, do I have
white stuff on my face?

1053
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:19,631
You know why I love you?

1054
01:21:21,127 --> 01:21:24,297
I love you because you're
down for anything. Always.

1055
01:21:25,298 --> 01:21:26,548
You know
I'm a down-ass bitch.

1056
01:21:26,633 --> 01:21:27,683
You are.

1057
01:21:27,759 --> 01:21:29,139
Hey, I'm down, too.

1058
01:21:29,302 --> 01:21:31,052
Ooh. Okay.

1059
01:21:32,722 --> 01:21:36,562
No, I love you, Ally, because
you're curious about the world.

1060
01:21:38,603 --> 01:21:40,733
And you're passionate,
and you are driven.

1061
01:21:40,814 --> 01:21:43,154
Did someone swallow Oprah
this morning?

1062
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:48,489
I love you, Linds.

1063
01:21:50,282 --> 01:21:52,582
I love you because
you're the kind of friend

1064
01:21:52,659 --> 01:21:54,409
that toilet-papers
Jason Foster's house

1065
01:21:54,494 --> 01:21:56,204
for a week straight
all by herself

1066
01:21:56,288 --> 01:21:58,158
just because he said
that I was a bad kisser.

1067
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:02,287
Asshole.

1068
01:22:07,591 --> 01:22:11,601
Oh, uh, I think I know why
Sam's in such a good mood.

1069
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,849
Oh.
It goes on him.

1070
01:22:29,696 --> 01:22:31,156
Thank you so much for that.

1071
01:22:46,171 --> 01:22:48,721
Sisyphus, not an STD.

1072
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,970
Sorry, it was an emergency
and a tribulation.

1073
01:22:51,051 --> 01:22:53,141
A minor LaserJet explosion.

1074
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:54,469
Val-a-gram delivery.

1075
01:22:54,554 --> 01:22:55,564
Happy Cupid Day.

1076
01:22:57,891 --> 01:22:58,981
It's so beautiful.

1077
01:22:59,059 --> 01:23:00,179
I'm in heteronormative hell.

1078
01:23:00,352 --> 01:23:01,352
I like your boots.

1079
01:23:02,062 --> 01:23:03,102
Sisyphus fails every time,

1080
01:23:05,148 --> 01:23:09,188
but he still thinks that he'll be
able to push that boulder uphill.

1081
01:23:10,362 --> 01:23:12,072
He's imprisoned
by his own hubris.

1082
01:23:13,198 --> 01:23:15,658
The only way to escape
is to change.

1083
01:23:16,534 --> 01:23:17,584
Be careful.

1084
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:21,580
Oh, man.

1085
01:23:21,706 --> 01:23:23,746
Sam. Hey.
Hey.

1086
01:23:25,669 --> 01:23:26,919
Um... "You're my hero."

1087
01:23:27,003 --> 01:23:28,593
You got a secret admirer?

1088
01:23:28,713 --> 01:23:32,013
Secret?
That's not so secret.

1089
01:23:32,092 --> 01:23:34,092
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1090
01:23:34,177 --> 01:23:35,217
Well, um...

1091
01:23:36,388 --> 01:23:40,138
Well, hey, listen, I'm having
a party tonight. Mmm-hmm.

1092
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:43,650
And I was wondering if you
maybe wanted to come,

1093
01:23:44,729 --> 01:23:46,859
maybe? Yeah? No?

1094
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:48,440
What's in it for me?

1095
01:23:49,275 --> 01:23:51,275
What's in it for me?

1096
01:23:54,572 --> 01:23:57,372
Yeah. And, um,

1097
01:23:57,450 --> 01:23:59,540
I have something I want to
tell you later. A secret.

1098
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:01,960
Later? Okay.
Yes. Okay.

1099
01:24:02,622 --> 01:24:04,962
Wait, the "you're my hero"
thing, how did you...

1100
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:08,245
Thank you for my beautiful rose.
I love it.

1101
01:24:15,677 --> 01:24:18,007
What'd you say to me?
This is not working out.

1102
01:24:19,139 --> 01:24:21,139
Okay, Sam, you can't
break up with me.

1103
01:24:21,266 --> 01:24:26,056
I think I can
and I think I just did.

1104
01:24:29,149 --> 01:24:30,149
I should've picked ELODY.

1105
01:24:36,322 --> 01:24:37,492
What just happened?

1106
01:24:37,949 --> 01:24:39,279
You guys were supposed to...

1107
01:24:39,367 --> 01:24:41,407
I mean, you said
you wanted to...

1108
01:24:43,413 --> 01:24:45,003
It's Rob Cokran.

1109
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:47,753
He doesn't deserve me.

1110
01:24:48,334 --> 01:24:50,174
Nonetheless, very shocking.

1111
01:24:50,295 --> 01:24:52,585
Sociopath, 12 o'clock.

1112
01:24:52,756 --> 01:24:53,836
Uh-oh.

1113
01:24:53,923 --> 01:24:55,343
Does it smell like pee in here?

1114
01:24:55,508 --> 01:24:56,758
Stop.

1115
01:24:56,843 --> 01:24:58,433
Norma Bates!
What?

1116
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:01,180
Just don't.

1117
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:02,524
But it's Juliet.

1118
01:25:02,849 --> 01:25:05,349
Exactly, it's Juliet.

1119
01:25:05,477 --> 01:25:08,017
She has a name
and she is a person.

1120
01:25:08,354 --> 01:25:09,904
Yesterday, you said
you were afraid

1121
01:25:09,981 --> 01:25:12,031
she would bite you
if she got too close.

1122
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:15,650
That was a long time ago.

1123
01:25:18,156 --> 01:25:19,406
That was yesterday.

1124
01:26:03,326 --> 01:26:04,326
Hey, Linds.

1125
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:06,250
All right, well, let's do this!

1126
01:26:06,371 --> 01:26:07,661
Linds.
What?

1127
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:10,924
How come you never told me
about your parents' divorce?

1128
01:26:12,836 --> 01:26:13,996
Are you serious?

1129
01:26:15,421 --> 01:26:16,421
Yeah.

1130
01:26:18,675 --> 01:26:21,755
Why would I talk about something
that happened a thousand years ago?

1131
01:26:23,179 --> 01:26:24,929
Because it happened to you.

1132
01:26:26,099 --> 01:26:27,269
And you matter to me.

1133
01:26:27,433 --> 01:26:28,577
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1134
01:26:28,601 --> 01:26:29,703
Come here.
Okay? Let's go inside.

1135
01:26:29,727 --> 01:26:30,767
Come here.

1136
01:26:34,524 --> 01:26:37,614
You know you don't have to
act so tough all the time.

1137
01:26:38,403 --> 01:26:39,403
Mmm.

1138
01:26:43,116 --> 01:26:44,946
Don't worry about me, okay?

1139
01:26:46,494 --> 01:26:47,704
I love you no matter what.

1140
01:26:47,787 --> 01:26:49,117
Let's get inside.
Okay.

1141
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:51,750
Move, move, move.

1142
01:27:00,133 --> 01:27:02,263
Hey, um, you made it.

1143
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:03,889
Come with me.

1144
01:27:03,970 --> 01:27:05,600
What? Okay.

1145
01:27:07,098 --> 01:27:08,468
What?

1146
01:27:12,729 --> 01:27:15,979
I believe
you owe me a secret, right?

1147
01:27:16,107 --> 01:27:17,397
I believe I do.

1148
01:27:17,483 --> 01:27:19,153
Okay, so let's hear it.

1149
01:27:23,489 --> 01:27:27,739
The secret is
yours was the best kiss

1150
01:27:27,827 --> 01:27:30,327
that I've ever had
in my entire life.

1151
01:27:33,458 --> 01:27:35,168
Um...

1152
01:27:35,335 --> 01:27:38,835
But we haven't kissed.

1153
01:27:42,342 --> 01:27:44,182
I mean,
not since the third grade.

1154
01:27:46,804 --> 01:27:49,774
Better get started then.
I don't have much time.

1155
01:28:21,506 --> 01:28:22,626
What was that for?

1156
01:28:23,883 --> 01:28:25,723
Because I wanted to.

1157
01:28:30,848 --> 01:28:32,138
I love you.

1158
01:28:48,408 --> 01:28:50,328
Juliet, I need to talk to you.

1159
01:28:50,410 --> 01:28:52,080
Just for a second.
It's okay. Please?

1160
01:28:52,161 --> 01:28:53,889
Actually, I kind of have
somewhere I have to be.

1161
01:28:53,913 --> 01:28:55,473
I know what you have
planned for tonight

1162
01:28:55,748 --> 01:28:58,668
and I want you to know that you
don't have to do this. Okay?

1163
01:28:58,751 --> 01:28:59,841
You don't know anything.

1164
01:28:59,919 --> 01:29:02,049
I know that you have
something to tell me.

1165
01:29:02,422 --> 01:29:04,172
You have something
to tell all of us.

1166
01:29:04,257 --> 01:29:05,427
You're a bitch.

1167
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,100
I have been a bitch.

1168
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:12,533
I have been a bitch. We all
have been bitches, and I...

1169
01:29:12,557 --> 01:29:13,557
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

1170
01:29:13,599 --> 01:29:15,244
Listen to me. I'm trying
to tell you how sorry...

1171
01:29:15,268 --> 01:29:16,268
I am sorry.
You said that.

1172
01:29:16,394 --> 01:29:17,914
I'm sorry,
but I have to come with you.

1173
01:29:18,563 --> 01:29:19,863
Leave me alone!
I can't.

1174
01:29:19,939 --> 01:29:21,109
Sam! Sam!

1175
01:29:21,232 --> 01:29:23,168
Why did you run away from me? I
can't talk to you right now.

1176
01:29:23,192 --> 01:29:25,004
You've been ignoring me for
years, and then you...

1177
01:29:25,028 --> 01:29:27,358
You kiss me and then go back
to acting like I'm invisible?

1178
01:29:27,447 --> 01:29:29,167
I meant everything
that happened back there.

1179
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,676
That's all I can say,
that I meant it,

1180
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:32,094
and I wish it hadn't
taken me so long.

1181
01:29:32,118 --> 01:29:36,618
Sam, are you in trouble?
You can trust me.

1182
01:29:37,582 --> 01:29:39,042
You can trust me back.

1183
01:29:44,422 --> 01:29:45,422
Juliet!

1184
01:29:48,259 --> 01:29:49,259
Juliet!

1185
01:29:57,810 --> 01:29:58,810
Juliet!

1186
01:30:09,822 --> 01:30:10,992
Juliet!

1187
01:30:12,325 --> 01:30:13,445
Juliet, don't!

1188
01:30:14,952 --> 01:30:16,162
Wait! Wait!

1189
01:30:16,746 --> 01:30:18,826
Why? What's going on?
Why are you following me?

1190
01:30:18,915 --> 01:30:20,915
Why can't you leave me alone?

1191
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,000
You don't want to die.

1192
01:30:23,252 --> 01:30:25,132
You want the pain to stop.

1193
01:30:26,506 --> 01:30:28,416
Stop. You stop.

1194
01:30:28,508 --> 01:30:30,758
You don't know me.

1195
01:30:30,843 --> 01:30:32,763
You could never understand.

1196
01:30:32,845 --> 01:30:34,755
You have a choice, Juliet.

1197
01:30:34,847 --> 01:30:36,427
Not everybody gets that.

1198
01:30:36,516 --> 01:30:37,636
Sam!

1199
01:30:39,685 --> 01:30:40,975
Please let me help you.

1200
01:30:41,312 --> 01:30:42,772
Don't you get it?

1201
01:30:44,273 --> 01:30:45,533
You can't help me.

1202
01:30:47,193 --> 01:30:48,783
I can't be fixed.

1203
01:30:48,861 --> 01:30:50,451
You're not the one
who needs fixing.

1204
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:52,030
There is nothing wrong with you.

1205
01:30:52,156 --> 01:30:54,276
Don't let anyone tell you
that there is.

1206
01:30:56,994 --> 01:31:01,874
This is just a blip.
Your life will change, Juliet.

1207
01:31:03,292 --> 01:31:07,712
If you just hold on
for one more minute.

1208
01:31:15,388 --> 01:31:16,428
It's too late.

1209
01:31:17,557 --> 01:31:20,227
No, it's not.
It's never too late.

1210
01:31:25,398 --> 01:31:26,398
Juliet, stop!

1211
01:31:40,872 --> 01:31:42,582
<i>Maybe for you
there's a tomorrow.</i>

1212
01:31:45,251 --> 01:31:49,921
<i>Maybe for you
there's 1,000 or 3,000</i>

1213
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:53,550
<i>or 10.</i>

1214
01:31:56,762 --> 01:32:00,102
<i>But for some of us,
there's only today.</i>

1215
01:32:02,435 --> 01:32:04,595
<i>And what you do today matters.</i>

1216
01:32:05,605 --> 01:32:06,685
<i>In the moment</i>

1217
01:32:09,567 --> 01:32:11,317
<i>and maybe into infinity.</i>

1218
01:32:13,404 --> 01:32:15,034
<i>I see only my greatest hits.</i>

1219
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:27,790
<i>I see the things
I want to remember.</i>

1220
01:32:32,131 --> 01:32:34,181
<i>And be remembered for.</i>

1221
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:44,350
<i>That's when I realized that
certain moments go on forever.</i>

1222
01:32:47,939 --> 01:32:50,479
<i>Even after they're over,
they still go on.</i>

1223
01:32:53,986 --> 01:32:55,316
<i>They are the meaning.</i>

1224
01:32:57,823 --> 01:32:58,823
Sam?

1225
01:33:00,493 --> 01:33:01,793
Sam?

1226
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:06,000
You saved me.

1227
