00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:40,606
<i>Let me
assert my firm belief...</i>

2
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:43,779
<i>that the only thing
we have to fear...</i>

3
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,198
<i>is fear itself.</i>

4
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,948
<i>That's one
small step for man...</i>

5
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,621
<i>This is Walter Cronkite
in our newsroom.</i>

6
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:56,542
<i>President Kennedy
died at 1 p.m.,</i>

7
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,619
<i>some 38 minutes ago.</i>

8
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,372
<i>...who are trying to make</i>

9
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,340
<i>a boogey out of us...</i>

10
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,425
<i>Go at throttle up.</i>

11
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,886
<i>This vehicle has exploded.</i>

12
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,550
<i>They are here in the thousands.</i>

13
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,218
<i>They are here
in the tens of thousands.</i>

14
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,218
<i>Diana,
Princess of Wales, has died.</i>

15
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,390
<i>This just in.</i>

16
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,807
<i>Television viewers
across the country</i>

17
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,230
<i>watch in astonishment...</i>

18
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,724
<i>- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, God.</i>

19
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,521
<i>There was
a huge explosion sound.</i>

20
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,096
Der Spiegel
is begging for more time.

21
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,181
<i>The Times wants to go.</i>

22
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,891
Let me talk to Rosenbach.

23
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,938
Christ,
it's like herding cats.

24
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,110
No, I don't want
to have to scroll down

25
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,358
for the Task Force 373 story.

26
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,781
Holger, I've got Nick.

27
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,153
Ah, great. Five minutes?

28
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,485
- We have to go.
- Five more minutes.

29
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,569
Yes, Bill, I know. But Nick
just spoke to Rosenbach.

30
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,158
<i>They need at least</i>
<i>another few minutes.</i>

31
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,457
No more delays, Alan.
You said twelve o' clock.

32
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,580
<i>I know, but the point
is to publish together.</i>

33
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,706
<i>You know the Germans.</i>

34
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,000
They need to dot all the "I's"
and cross all the "T's."

35
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,040
Go. Now.

36
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,170
It's live.
The Times is live.

37
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,054
Well, there you go.
Patience, humility,

38
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,507
all American virtues.

39
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,512
Yes, Bill, thanks very much
for not giving a shit.

40
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,717
Go.

41
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,699
<i>Of course, our top
story this morning...</i>

42
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,375

<i>and special forces

53
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,063
<i>The most serious allegation
is that some soldiers</i>

54
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,640
<i>committed war crimes.</i>

55
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,058
<i>I know
much has been written...</i>

56
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,314

58
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,278
<i>What is this website,
"WikiLeaks"?</i>

59
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,324
<i>And who is Julian Assange?</i>

60
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,199
<i>Assange has made WikiLeaks
a global force.</i>

61
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,704
<i>And for better or worse...</i>

62
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,202
<i>exposed what he considers</i>

00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,171
<i>and encrypted cell phones

70
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,470
<i>The U.S. government argues</i>

71
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,548
<i>there's nothing noble
about Assange.</i>

72
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,385
<i>A U.S. official describes him

73
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,398
Come on!

74
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,231
It's Daniel.

75
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,072
Shit.

76
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,156
Uh, good morning.

77
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,868
I assume most of you
have read, uh,

78
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,498
this morning's papers. Um...

79
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,251
This is...

80
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,791
<i>The Guardian.</i> Um...

81
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,340
Fourteen... Fourteen pages
about this topic.

82
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,093
<i>Also, concurrently,
Der Spiegel...</i>

83
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,924
The New York Times...

84
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,011
<i>These are revelations which

<i>we thought we understood...</i>

88
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,642
<i>but we may not
have known at all.</i>

89
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,887
Mr. Berg.

90
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,431
Have you seen this?

91
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,135
They're pouring out of
every printer in the office.

92
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,849
I guess someone's pissed

93
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,976
you made New Year's Eve
a work day.

94
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,978
Well, as our resident
computer genius...

95
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,606
could you please find out
who that someone is?

96
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,487
Whoever it was disguised
his IP address.

97
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,994
According to this, the print
jobs are coming from...

98
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,197
your computer.

99
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,245
It's thousands of pages.

100
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,703
You'll have to manually reboot
it if you want it to stop.

101
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,879
Where are you going? I need
you to finish the Opel job.

102
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,340
I costed out GM, too.

103
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,044
In case you need something
to do on New Year's Eve.

104
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,724
Charlie in maintenance said
you left this by the scanner.

105
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,103
Happy New Year.

106
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,854
Daniel Berg. I volunteered
to sell shirts tomorrow.

107
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,482
We must be
on the schedule somewhere.

108
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,110
My associate Jay Lim sent in
our proposals months ago.

109
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,566
I'll be back in a minute.

110
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,526
We didn't get anything
from Wikileakers.

111
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,610
"WikiLeaks."

112
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,741
Wiki-whatever.

113
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,993
This is ridiculous.
Who's in charge here?

114
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,494
- Julian?
- Huh?

115
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,076
It's Daniel. Daniel Berg.

116
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,627
I contacted you over chat.

117
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:15,704
Daniel. Thank God.

118
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:16,788
I've got people waiting, here.

119
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,918
Can you help me
with this prick?

120
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,458
His organization is super cool.

121
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,134
They've been doing
crazy shit in Kenya.

122
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,507
The least you could do
is put us on your program.

123
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,680
The small conference rooms
are all booked.

124
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,803
What about the auditorium?

125
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,385
It's empty until the talk
about hacking video games.

126
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,438
Okay, you can have
that for half an hour.

127
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,106
- Thank you.
- But nobody's gonna show up

128
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,774
unless you print some flyers.

129
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,648
Well, that shouldn't
be a problem.

130
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:40,813
Daniel...

131
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,363
God forbid
we give out free toner

132
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,861
to human rights activists.

133
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,027
Sorry.

134
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,413
I totally spaced out
on that proposal.

135
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,287
Mind you,
I was a bit busy in Nairobi.

136
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,492
Oh, by the way,
that report we leaked...

137
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,955
shifted voting 10%
in the presidential election.

138
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,545
You might want to mention that
when you introduce me.

139
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,377
Sure.

140
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,056
Shredded my power cord
in Mombasa.

141
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,889
I assume the club won't mind
making a small donation.

142
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,637
I'll pay for the cord if
you actually get it to work.

143
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,939
Well, when you're taking on
global corruption...

144
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,436
you need a few super powers.

145
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,987
<i>Et voila!</i>

146
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:35,455
<i>I'm a mathematician
by training.</i>

147
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,588
<i>When I was a grad student
in Melbourne...</i>

148
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,631
<i>I became interested in...</i>

149
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,254
Okay,
send us the camera now!

150
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,257
- ...how...
- Excuse me, a little bit more!

151
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,973
<i>I became
interested in information...</i>

152
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,224
Okay, switching!

153
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,180
<i>...and how it flows
through society.</i>

154
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,225
<i>- And how...</i>

155
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,652
<i>when new information
comes to light,</i>

156
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,196
<i>it can bring about
great change.</i>

157
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,571
Excuse me.

158
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,953
Two people...

159
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,957
and a secret.

160
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,165
The beginning of any conspiracy

161
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,037
and of all corruption.

162
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,122
Otto...

163
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,582
- Otto, what is he doing?
- And as it grows...

164
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,549
...more lies, deceits.

165
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,717
More people...

166
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,471
and more secrets.

167
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,014
But...

168
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,310
if we can find one moral man...

169
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,229
one whistleblower...

170
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,940
Someone willing to expose
all these secrets.

171
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:52,281
That man could topple the most
repressive of regimes.

172
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,247
What the hell?

173
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,416
Otto, my talk is in 10 minutes!

174
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,788
<i>And there's the problem.</i>

175
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,211
He just ruined
my entire presentation!

176
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,708
<i>Retribution.</i>

177
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,919
<i>Whistleblowers are
afraid to come forward</i>

178
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,422
<i>because they fear retribution.</i>

179
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,005
<i>But what if we could
remove that fear?</i>

180
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,143
<i>Twenty years ago,
I bought my first modem</i>

181
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,935
<i>and joined a legion.</i>

182
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,356
<i>Cypherpunks, fighting
for freedom, for privacy...</i>

183
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:25,151
<i>for the right to remain
concealed in clouds of code.</i>

184
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,529
Today's hackers
take it for granted,

185
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,027
but they surf the Internet...

186
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:34,824
because of the programs
we created to hide data...

187
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,702
to... to hide our identities.

188
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,248
Even then,
I knew this technology...

189
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:47,465
could hold the key to a whole
new form of social justice.

190
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:53,422
Hundreds of volunteers work
on the documents we are sent.

191
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,099
But we've honed
our technology...

192
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,847
to a point that
even I don't know

193
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,974
the identity of our sources.

194
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,190
And if the whistleblower's
identity is secret...

195
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,272
then he has nothing to fear.

196
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,238
As Oscar Wilde said...

197
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:14,034
"Give a man a mask, and
he will tell you the truth."

198
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,245
Sorry, it's going to be
a few minutes.

199
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,660
We had some
technical difficulties.

200
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,083
Good talk, huh?

201
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,284
You think so?

202
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,961
People anonymously
sharing secrets...

203
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,414
I mean, isn't that why
we tore down the Wall?

204
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,717
Believe me, no one
is interested in your secrets.

205
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,636
Yours, on the other hand...

206
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,052
It was great. It's a shame
the turnout wasn't better.

207
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,096
One convert at a time.

208
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,678
By the way, I can soup up
the graphics if you want.

209
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,887
What's wrong with
the ones I've got?

210
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:43,972
Nothing.

211
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,149
I'm sure they would have
blown people away in the '80s.

212
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,817
Hey...

213
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,237
do you want to check out
the talk on microcontrollers?

214
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,398
The guy who invented TV-B-Gone
is speaking.

215
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,701
It's a remote. You walk
into a bar and turn off...

216
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,746
all the TVs.

217
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,165
Don't you get bored
spending your time

218
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,993
with all these wankers?

219
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,921
Building antennae
out of Pringles packets...

220
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:11,170
<i>reading Neuromancer
and playing Call of Cthulhu.</i>

221
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,217
What a waste!

222
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,548
Capable generous men,
men of purpose.

223
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,388
That's what the world needs.
All this?

224
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,517
It's not what we fought for.

225
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,268
Shit. Come on.

226
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,521
Hurry up, Daniel.

227
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,617
- Where are we going?
-  To church.

228
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,538
A government
destroyed by tyranny...

229
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,706
rebuilt under a glass dome

230
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,913
so the whole world
could look in.

231
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,083
There's an ideal to aspire to.

232
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,927
Just look at it, Daniel.

233
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,971
Risen from the ashes.

234
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,175
A whole city,
once ruled by fascists,

235
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,851
now overrun by artists,
by anarchists...

236
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,437
and crows and snowstorms...

237
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,814
and transparency.

238
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,860
My father took me to the dome
when they first built it.

239
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,145
I was 13.

240
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,320
He wasn't quite so eloquent.

241
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,945
Yeah, well, when I was 13,

242
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,823
my mum started
dating this guy...

243
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,280
from a nasty Australian cult
called The Family.

244
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,207
They believed in blue auras
and cleansing souls...

245
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,410
and the strict discipline
of children.

246
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,455
<i>Severe beatings...</i>

247
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,166
starvation diets...

248
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,928
regular closings
of psychiatric drugs.

249
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,342
My mum knew
the guy was a wanker...

250
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,052
but by the time
she came to her senses

251
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,808
they had a kid together and...

252
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,642
We spent the next three
years on the run.

253
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,770
They chased us
all over the country.

254
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,947
That's terrifying.

255
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,367
Why do you think
my hair is white?

256
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,372
Come on.

257
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,172
I want to show you something.

258
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,507
It's called the Tacheles.

259
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,008
It's an artists' squat.

260
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,598
They were going to tear it
down in the '90s...

261
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,016
but some painters occupied it.

262
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,430
Cool.

263
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,686
Listen, I better get to work.

264
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,853
Now?

265
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,524
Life on the run,
Aussie jet lag.

266
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,603
You stop distinguishing
between night and day.

267
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,820
Sorry.

268
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,883
So what are you working on?

269
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,220
Look, today was cool,

270
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,467
but these are
sensitive documents.

271
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,390
People's lives are at stake.

272
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,139
You can trust me.

273
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,921
<i>Yes, and quiet.</i>

274
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,635
<i>There's a new leak
on the submission platform.</i>

275
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,855
<i>In my twenties, I created
a tool called Rubberhose.</i>

276
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,857
<i>It hid sensitive information</i>

277
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,940
<i>beneath layers and layers
of fake data.</i>

278
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,738
<i>WikiLeaks is based
on the same idea.</i>

279
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,278
<i>Take any message.</i>

280
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,575
<i>"Are you safe?"</i>

281
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,790
<i>"Are you safe?"</i>

282
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,124
<i>We constantly upload
fake data from fake sources...</i>

283
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:25,254
<i>to make it impossible
to monitor our real sources.</i>

284
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,430
<i>And their very presence
is infinitely deniable.</i>

285
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,477
<i>The system makes
leaks untraceable.</i>

286
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,700
<i>They simply turn up
on the submission platform.</i>

287
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,002
<i>Ever heard of Julius Baer?</i>

288
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,848
<i>It's a big
Swiss Bank, right?</i>

289
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,141
<i>Huge.
Manages 400 billion dollars</i>

290
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,566
<i>for the ultra-rich.</i>

291
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:25,029
<i>It uses offshore secrecy laws
to hide money for fat cats...</i>

292
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,782
<i>wealthy assholes in Germany,
Switzerland, U.K.</i>

293
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,664
<i>The leak is from
someone inside the bank?</i>

294
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,494
I don't know.

295
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,415
See the beauty of it?

296
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,427
Let me guess. Secret plans
for the revolution?

297
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,094
Jay Lim and the volunteers
in Switzerland

298
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,311
will analyze the docs...

299
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,231
but I need you to verify
that they're real.

300
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,940
The metadata should contain
a list of authors.

301
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,907
Extract it and confirm that
these people work at the bank.

302
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,163
What? Did you think
we just threw what we got up

303
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,739
on the website?

304
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,416
No, but...

305
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,535
you're just giving me the docs?

306
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,746
You said I could trust you.

307
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,626
You can.

308
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,591
I know.
I'm a good judge of character.

309
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,970
Stay offline when you're
working on the docs.

310
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:32,972
And buy yourself a cryptophone.

311
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,431
Julius Bar Bank,
Ralf Zilke's office.

312
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,854
I'm sorry, I must have
the wrong extension.

313
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:40,930
What division is this?

314
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,684
Personal Wealth Management.
Who were you looking for?

315
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,567
I was actually looking
for Ms. Leisal Grop.

316
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,611
Ms. Grop is down the hall
in Client Services.

317
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:52,949
Can I transfer you?

318
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,286
<i>Yes, please.
Thank you.</i>

319
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,921
What are you doing in here?

320
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,005
Um...

321
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,177
Sensitive research.

322
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,141
You're playing
<i>World of Warcraft</i> aren't you?

323
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,814
We're investigating corruption
in a Swiss Bank.

324
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:07,858
Of course.

325
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,941
Well, then I guess
I can cover for you.

326
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,888
<i>I worked for these
assholes for years...</i>

327
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,978
before I understood the extent
of the deception.

328
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,889
It's a massive tax dodge.

329
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,645
Last year, those diagrams...

330
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,476
cheated your country alone

331
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,233
out of 30 billion
in tax revenues.

332
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,147
And you'll explain them to us?

333
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,233
You understand I won't
just be exposing the bank.

334
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,819
They have hundreds of clients
from New York to Moscow...

335
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,367
who will go to great lengths
to hold on to their money.

336
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,162
We understand the risks.

337
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,493
We've got incredible
infrastructure.

338
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,997
Hundreds of volunteers,

339
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,000
people who've dealt
with these threats.

340
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,581
Our process is totally secure.

341
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,257
We don't even know
your real name.

342
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,334
You're damn right.

343
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,171
I'll explain the documents,
but you never met me...

344
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,090
and when the shit comes down,
it's on your house.

345
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,933
Are we clear, Mr...

346
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,604
Schmitt. Daniel Schmitt.

347
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,190
The bank has a huge network.

348
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,361
<i>Right, I'm sure.</i>

349
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,904
They've got billions of
dollars buried in the Caymans.

350
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,279
<i>Well... Yeah,
but by this time tomorrow</i>

351
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,951
<i>the whole world's
gonna know about it.</i>

352
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,700
<i>And I can tell you,
the response to this...</i>

353
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,201
is gonna be
absolutely colossal.

354
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,954
We're gonna nail
those bastards.

355
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,792
<i>You know,
our friend was pretty jittery.</i>

356
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:49,960
Of course he was.

357
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,127
Hey, Julian, let's go.

358
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,086
How fast can you get
Bellman a summary?

359
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,800
I'll stay up until it's done.

360
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,966
All right, Daniel. Remember,
courage is contagious.

361
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,059
<i>They marched from</i>

362
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,233
<i>the townships, from the slums.</i>

363
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,901
<i>Opposition supporters
determined</i>

364
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,569
<i>that this would be the day...</i>

365
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,818
<i>they would expose
Kenya's elections as a sham.</i>

366
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,737
<i>Delivering an empathic
message...</i>

367
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,410
<i>to the president whose
reelection they reject...</i>

368
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,737
<i>and the outside world.</i>

369
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,243
<i>But this was what
they discovered.</i>

370
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,166
<i>Riot police with orders that</i>

371
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,084
<i>no mass demonstration
was to be allowed.</i>

372
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,831
<i>This was not a day for debate.</i>

373
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,799
<i>The argument,
settled decisively.</i>

374
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,011
Ralf Zilke's office.

375
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,606
- Mr. Zilke?
- Yeah.

376
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,950
I'm sorry,
I just got an odd call

377
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,197
from the tech department.

378
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,946
I sent you the link.

379
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,872
They say there's a report
on this website.

380
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:18,545
Get me Friedrich.

381
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,302
And wake up our lawyers
in California.

382
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:22,629
And in New York.

383
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,467
And London.

384
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,063
So, their lawyers
are threatening you?

385
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,399
Julian says you can spend
your life in cushy cubicles

386
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,741
or you can march.

387
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,661
You can breathe the tear gas
and brave the truncheons or...

388
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,363
Take a girl to dinner?

389
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,180
Hey.

390
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:15,935
Hey.

391
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,859
Sorry, I didn't want
to wake you up.

392
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,186
It's okay.

393
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,021
I've just never had a guy
try to sneak out

394
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,276
of his own apartment.

395
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,275
The bank got a judge
in California

396
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,281
- to shut down our site.
- What?

397
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,282
I thought the Americans
put free speech up there

398
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,124
with mom and apple pie.

399
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,788
So did we.

400
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,751
Julian wants to meet
right away.

401
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,467
You know, this isn't how
I imagined our first, um...

402
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,467
How did you imagine it?

403
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,236
Uh...

404
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,938
Do you have a cryptophone?

405
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,066
Uh... No.

406
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,406
But that might be
the best excuse

407
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,487
I've ever heard
for not calling.

408
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:37,937
<i>We've got to get</i>

409
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,105
the story out
on blogs, Twitter,

410
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,353
they're defrauding the world.

411
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,854
- We can't let them do this.
- Exactly.

412
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,607
It's impossible that
one judge in California

413
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,608
can make it all disappear.
It's out now.

414
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,689
<i>Well, remember what
Solzhenitsyn said.</i>

415
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:50,364
"No one can bar
the road to truth."

416
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,779
<i>And Solzhenitsyn
didn't even have Twitter.</i>

417
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,114
I mean, whoever thought that
we'd need extra servers...

418
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,699
to fight censorship attacks

419
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,622
from the bastion
of free speech.

420
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,668
I sent leaks to our
mirror sites. You should...

421
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,041
Having fun making history
instead of reading about it?

422
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,715
Yeah. And there's a new <i>WIRED</i>
blog you should post as well.

423
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,171
Let's have a look.

424
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:18,479
<i>Yeah, but if
Julius Bar really believes</i>

425
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,056
<i>that censoring one website...</i>

426
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,227
<i>will solve their problems...</i>

427
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,646
<i>they just don't understand
how information flows</i>

428
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,227
<i>in the 21st century.
I mean, look...</i>

429
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,480
<i>Our mirror sites
make it impossible...</i>

430
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,907
for the bank to put the genie
back in the bottle.

431
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,405
Of course,
we're happy that the EFF

432
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,327
and the ACLU are behind us.

433
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,246
But to be honest,
the court of public opinion...

434
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,081
has already ruled in our favor.

435
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,080
Some French hackers
donated domains.

436
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,160
Mmm.

437
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,996
Send the links to Bellman,
he'll blast the LISTSERV.

438
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,085
Yeah, no.

439
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,924
But, with an organization

440
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,752
the size and scale
of WikiLeaks...

441
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:52,221
grassroots support is vital.

442
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,517
Move the U.S. primaries
to page three

443
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,015
to make room
for the Diana inquest.

444
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,018
Yes, yes, yes.
Diana still sells newspapers.

445
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,269
Can't afford reporters?

446
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,767
Grab a story off the wire...

447
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,773
give it a little scrub,
drop it in the paper.

448
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:10,023
Twenty-first century
churnalism at its finest.

449
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,778
Is this how
you're chatting up the totty

450
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,446
in your golden years?

451
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:14,659
Well, I certainly
can't impress them...

452
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,744
with some of the stories
rattling around

453
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,242
the mainstream media
echo chamber.

454
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:19,915
The women I meet
are smart enough to know

455
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,742
what they're missing out on.

456
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,453
I assume you're gonna tell us
what that is?

457
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,125
I'll leave that to Mr. Assange

458
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,748
and his merry band
of programmers.

459
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,418
We have to help them, Alan.

460
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,313
<i>The Guardian,
The Times, CBS</i> are all linking

461
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,647
to our mirror sites.

462
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,145
Listen to this.

463
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,227
"The Bank's injunction
has brought an obscure group

464
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,937
"of dreamers to prominence...

465
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,402
"paradoxically generating
more attention...

466
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,734
"for their apparently
uncensorable leaking machine.

467
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,403
"And the bank's clients

468
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,079
"in Germany, the US..."

469
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,577
Can you believe it?

470
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,910
Actual justice
for those assholes.

471
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,335
That's great.

472
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,627
That's great.

473
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,509
Wow.

474
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,222
The judge must have lifted
the injunction.

475
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,387
Look, we're back online.

476
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,635
Holy shit.

477
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,472
- We won.
- Mmm-hmm.

478
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,436
We took down
a billion-dollar bank.

479
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,773
- This is crazy.
- I know.

480
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,695
We have to celebrate.

481
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,940
Yeah, we should, uh...
We should...

482
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,616
I don't know,
order some beers or something.

483
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,201
No, with everyone.

484
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,655
With Bellman, Jay Lim,
everybody else.

485
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,247
This was a team effort.

486
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,665
We should get on Skype
or something.

487
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,492
Oh, I don't know.
It's quite late, actually.

488
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,294
Come on. I just got
an email from Bellman.

489
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,089
And I was chatting with
Jay Lim 15 minutes ago.

490
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:59,056
Okay, it's probably time that
you met everyone face-to-face.

491
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,222
Maybe not in here.
Let's go inside.

492
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,091
<i>I don't get it.</i>

493
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,594
It says I called...

494
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,195
Are you Jay Lim?

495
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,206
- And Bellman?
- Yep.

496
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,203
How many volunteers do we have?

497
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,378
Hundreds.

498
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,465
<i>We have hundreds of volunteers.</i>

499
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,849
What?

500
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,269
We have hundreds
of email addresses.

501
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:32,395
That's not the same thing.

502
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,727
Look, every startup
exaggerates its size.

503
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,733
Otherwise,
why would people leak us

504
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,234
confidential information?

505
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,407
Two freaks
with a single server?

506
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,158
We only have one sewer?

507
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,620
Hmm, not as far as the outside
world is concerned, no.

508
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:49,250
Look, Castro started
a revolution with 82 men.

509
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,076
It does not matter
how small you are...

510
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,003
as long as you have faith
and a plan of action.

511
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,589
I lied to dozens of reporters.

512
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,084
- Pff.
- Our source at Julius Bar.

513
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,418
Necessary fictions.

514
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,174
If Julius Bar knew that
they were up against

515
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,341
an army of two...

516
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,510
What? They would rub us out?

517
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,966
They're a bank,
they're not the mob.

518
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,352
Why have you been
using an alias, then?

519
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,770
Come on, Daniel.

520
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:14,100
It's a hack,
an inelegant solution.

521
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,025
It could've been so simple.

522
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,353
I've got a hundred friends
I could have called.

523
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:19,859
This is bullshit!

524
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,612
Friends, you can call friends.

525
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:24,864
Okay, I've got to...

526
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,989
show you something.
Where is it?

527
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,371
Where the hell is it?

528
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,462
Open it.

529
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,395
Read it. Read what's inside.

530
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,897
There were three of us.

531
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,809
Mendax, Trax, Prime Suspect.

532
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,395
Three boys with cartoon names,

533
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,822
<i>off on a series
of harmless adventures.</i>

534
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,820
Subversives, one and all.

535
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,493
And when the federal police
finally caught up with us...

536
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,737
Trax pled guilty...

537
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,245
and Prime Suspect, he turned
Crown Witness against me.

538
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:17,379
I remember waiting for that
verdict in this little room...

539
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,082
and pacing backwards
and forwards

540
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:22,676
in a figure eight
like a demented bee.

541
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:27,010
And I knew what life would
be like in a tiny cell and...

542
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:29,929
Stressful.

543
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,933
For real, why my hair
turned white.

544
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,691
You don't get far in this
world by relying on others.

545
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,064
People...

546
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,609
People are loyal until
it seems opportune not to be.

547
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:52,035
The tyrants we're up against
have men, money and guns...

548
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,786
and I don't have an army
to fight them with.

549
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,284
All I've got is a website,

550
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:58,587
a couple of fake
email addresses and...

551
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,458
And you.

552
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,308
Do I have you?

553
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,312
<i>The firewall
of Chinese censorship</i>

554
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,479
<i>was punctured this week...</i>

555
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,648
<i>as WikiLeaks
published 35 videos</i>

556
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,819
<i>of the Tibetan protest...</i>

557
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,238
<i>which quickly went viral.</i>

558
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,405
<i>Following the fire</i>

559
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,573
<i>at the Monju reactor...</i>

560
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,651
<i>officials played down
the extent of the damage...</i>

561
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,906
<i>and denied the existence</i>

562
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,488
<i>of any footage
of the sodium spill.</i>

563
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,415
<i>The video, now streaming
on the WikiLeaks site.</i>

564
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,582
The documents,

565
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,581
<i>the so-called
Bibles of Scientology...</i>

566
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,913
<i>have been collected
and published on WikiLeaks...</i>

567
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,998
<i>and they do little to change
the minds of skeptics.</i>

568
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:46,002
<i>And they had elected a fellow
by the name of Xemu...</i>

569
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,507
<i>uh, could be
spelled X-E-M-U...</i>

570
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,506
<i>to the Supreme Rulah,</i>

571
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,763
<i>and they were about
to un-elect him.</i>

572
00:34:57,971 --> 00:35:02,021
I mean, this guy founded
a goddamn religion.

573
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,519
It's gobsmacking, isn't it?

574
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:04,603
We're trying to expose

575
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,609
what the members
have to go through.

576
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:10,192
Um, there are memos on the
introspection rundowns, uh...

577
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,447
forced isolation, you know,
regulation of meals...

578
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,621
Six Apart would love to do

579
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:16,698
a piece on this, sir.

580
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,871
Do you have a French spokesman
I can follow up with in Paris?

581
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,202
The hallowed <i>Guardian,</i>

582
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,128
gracing us with their presence.

583
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,882
Look, a young Woodward
and Bernstein.

584
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,834
Excuse me.

585
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,218
Now look at this.

586
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,295
Hustling for a story,

587
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,721
trying to get the world
to pay attention.

588
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,964
I should be working for him.

589
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,550
At the rate
they're sacking journalists,

590
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,634
you might not have a choice.

591
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,719
It sounds like you're trying
to put us out of business.

592
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,642
I just want you to do
your job properly.

593
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,065
If you can't, someone needs
to pick up the slack.

594
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,854
Oh, is that what you're doing?

595
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,065
Look, anyone can take
a bundle of information...

596
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,063
and toss it up on a website
and call it news.

597
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,398
And people buy our papers

598
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,399
for something a little
more discerning.

599
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,326
People are still
buying your paper?

600
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,825
Look, look, look, gentlemen,
we're on the same page.

601
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,705
This is citizen journalism,
Ian.

602
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,207
It's like a new nervous system.

603
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,584
Looks like it's a bit twitchy.

604
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,006
Yeah, well,
getting 10,000 hits an hour

605
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,334
can do that to you.

606
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,669
By the way,
how is your website doing?

607
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,259
Yes, come on.

608
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,932
We're down again.
We need to add new servers.

609
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,263
Pff.!

610
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,765
Well, that's the price you pay

611
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,100
for giving the world
news for free.

612
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,519
There ain't no money in it.

613
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,859
I've got a few
thousand Euros saved up.

614
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,699
That's a half-dozen
machines on eBay.

615
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,569
What?

616
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,622
Are we not inspired,
men of purpose?

617
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,913
Capable, generous men?

618
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,583
Ah.

619
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,458
it doesn't exactly look
like a data center.

620
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:10,713
Hey.

621
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,707
Hey.

622
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,634
Nice. You know
the way to my heart, huh?

623
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:17,970
Long trip-

624
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,548
Julian, meet Marcus,

625
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,141
the second greatest hacker
in the world.

626
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,343
How are you?

627
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,894
Fine.

628
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,148
Okay, uh,
just hook it up right there,

629
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,022
next to the other old IBMs.

630
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,649
And do me a favor,
take off all the tags...

631
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,401
because I don't want to know
which one it is.

632
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,823
You want to protect us
from yourself?

633
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,742
Well, plausible deniability
is never a bad thing, right?

634
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,408
Especially when there might
be jackboots at the door.

635
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,497
A man who understands security.

636
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,495
I'm just basically
following the tradition

637
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,746
of some excellent hackers.

638
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:51,755
One in particular
who went by this curious name.

639
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,756
Something out of Horace...

640
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,922
<i>splendide mendax,</i> noble liar.

641
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,010
I'm sorry but it's just,
you know...

642
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,341
the way Daniel talks,

643
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,425
I suspected
an illustrious past.

644
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,432
So I did some digging.

645
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,771
Wow. Hacking NASA.

646
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,600
Impressive. MILNET.

647
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,768
You hacked
the U.S. Defense Network?

648
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,861
It, uh, was a long time ago.

649
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,189
Lots of backdoors,

650
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,774
it really wasn't
that difficult.

651
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,529
Delightfully deceiving.

652
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,110
Just like your name.

653
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,451
And your, uh,
robust infrastructure.

654
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,868
No offense,
but any leet hack could see

655
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,203
that your tech was junk.

656
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,380
So, good thing
you're adding servers.

657
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,131
Mmm.

658
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,133
Uh... Your cows seem
a little depressed.

659
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,757
Do you milk those yourself

660
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:47,056
or get other people
to do it for you?

661
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,263
Sometimes.

662
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,556
Yeah.

663
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,811
He can do some coding.

664
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,484
I don't want you to let him
on the primary server.

665
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,561
Marcus just wants
to be involved.

666
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,816
He's a bit of a legend
in the club.

667
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,318
- Hmm.
- He could be a big help.

668
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,986
Yeah, well, people with
that much experience

669
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,984
tend to have a mind
of their own.

670
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,913
Holy shit.

671
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,241
The new server
is already working.

672
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,746
We've got a ton of new traffic.

673
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,578
Look, there's at least
half a dozen new leaks.

674
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,839
This is a Jihadist
training manual.

675
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,341
- Gang wars in the U.S. Army.
- Wow.

676
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,298
A list of British National
Party members.

677
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,511
Shit.

678
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,672
It's thousands of neo-Nazis,
right in the heart of London.

679
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,012
Three thousand kilometers?
Where were you?

680
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,092
It's none of our business.

681
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,519
Could you mind
your own business?

682
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:54,877
Mr. Berg.

683
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,715
- Hey.
- You're alive?

684
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,345
And starving.

685
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,286
The British press is going nuts

686
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,682
over the National Party
member list.

687
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,554
People are donating money.
Not a lot, but some.

688
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,767
And we're getting more leaks.

689
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,941
Toxic dumping
in the Ivory Coast,

690
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,898
corruption in Kosovo.

691
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,274
What? You don't like it?

692
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,276
Mmm! It's delicious.

693
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,365
It's just a bit cold, but...

694
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,948
Yes, it's been sitting there
for an hour.

695
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,119
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

696
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,547
It's just the addresses
I don't get.

697
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,627
What?

698
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:28,300
The National Party members.

699
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:30,215
I mean, those people
should be exposed...

700
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:33,268
but you published
their personal information.

701
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,888
Phone numbers, home addresses.

702
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,222
They were in the documents.

703
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:38,807
Yes, but why not cut them out?

704
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:42,311
They have families, children.
Someone could get hurt.

705
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,776
Editing reflects bias.

706
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,066
Our sources, the people
on the site, they trust us...

707
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:50,572
because we don't
screw with the documents.

708
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:51,823
As Julian says...

709
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,659
"Free people
must have knowledge."

710
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,125
Or, as Orwell says,
"Big Brother is watching."

711
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,833
Is this because
I stayed in on Friday?

712
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,093
I couldn't care less
about Friday.

713
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:09,921
I had a perfectly good time
with Nik and Claudia...

714
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,426
despite the fact
that Nik tried to get me

715
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:12,974
to go home with him again.

716
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:14,846
Oh.

717
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:19,689
Don't look so concerned.
He bores the shit out of me.

718
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,601
Maybe that's exactly
what you need.

719
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:26,278
Hey, I was the one
who told you to quit your job.

720
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:27,526
I'm glad you did.

721
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,107
I'm just saying that,
if you're gonna...

722
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,442
I don't know...

723
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:31,863
nail yourself to a cross...

724
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:33,616
then you should probably
know what it's made of.

725
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,051
Do you even remember
the last time we had sex?

726
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:58,178
I'm sure I'm gonna remember
the next time.

727
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,684
So goddamn clever.

728
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,565
Just a little clever.

729
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,582
Mmm.

730
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,433
What was that?

731
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,607
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

732
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,524
Well, neo-Nazis
wouldn't knock, right?

733
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,124
Jesus.

734
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,212
I thought
you were in Australia.

735
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:09,290
Yeah. Well, I thought
it best not to, um...

736
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,633
to telegraph my movements.

737
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:12,877
By the way,
you should probably take

738
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,212
your name off the door.

739
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,138
Have you seen
the latest expose...

740
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:19,138
by the Kenyan National
Coalition on Human Rights?

741
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,721
They've revealed that police
are running death squads.

742
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:23,975
My friend Oscar
wrote the report.

743
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,227
Kibaki wants to bury it.

744
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:26,774
We need to get it up
on the homepage.

745
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,477
It details hundreds of murders,

746
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,153
massive human rights
violations.

747
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,113
It's like exposing Chile
under Pinochet.

748
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,410
Have you got any of
that disgusting energy drink?

749
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,488
It might be a long night.

750
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,743
Hey.

751
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,996
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting something?

752
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:57,676
Hey.

753
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:00,633
Anke.

754
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,434
Anke, come on.

755
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,933
Come back inside, please.
It's late.

756
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,273
- Tell him to go.
- I can't.

757
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,354
Do you want me to come
back inside? Tell him to go!

758
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,528
Listen, we've been working
on this project for months.

759
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:18,026
Julian thinks it could be
the most important leak

760
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,110
we've ever had.

761
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,696
- He just got off the plane.
- Listen to yourself!

762
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,660
Why do you try so hard
to be him?

763
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,290
What?

764
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,211
You'll never be him.

765
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,500
He's got nowhere else to stay.

766
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,509
Well, I do.

767
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:04,868
Mmm.

768
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,742
- Is that my jacket?
- Mmm.

769
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,583
I'm about to write a press
release on death squads.

770
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:12,834
I wanted to wear
something that matched

771
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,085
the gravity of the occasion.

772
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:25,768
I have a son in Melbourne,
you know.

773
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,274
He turns 19 next week.

774
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,443
I haven't seen him in a year.

775
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,438
It takes two things
to change the world...

776
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,736
and you'd be surprised how
many people have good ideas.

777
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,451
But commitment...

778
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,281
true commitment,
that's the hard one.

779
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,368
It requires sacrifice.

780
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,300
- What's his name?
- Daniel.

781
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,978
His name is Daniel.

782
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:25,744

<i>Iceland's biggest bank,

<i>loaned billions

<i>a key contributor to the

802
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,736
<i>The bank obtained a court
order against network RUV...</i>

803
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:03,782
<i>but that did little good.</i>

804
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:08,450
We lead tonight with the
collapse of the Kaupthing Bank.

805
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,827
Due to a count injunction, we
can't bring you the whole stony.

806
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:14,877
But there is an organization that can.
You'll find them at Wikileaks.org

807
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,461
<i>WikiLeaks is redefining</i>

808
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,884
the public's right
to information.

809
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:24,880
I'd like to add whatever
legitimacy I can,

810
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,305
right after I buy them a drink.

811
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,177
Iceland could become
a new utopia.

812
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:35,815
A refuge for whistleblowers
and investigative journalists.

813
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:37,232
She's a Member of Parliament?

814
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:39,231
Apparently,
our latest spokesperson.

815
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,986
...for the legislative process

816
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,984
of bringing freedom
of information...

817
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:46,533
expression and speech,
into the 21 st century.

818
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,902
- Thank you.
- Whoo!

819
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:54,583
Thank you so much.

820
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,202
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

821
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,083
So, what do you want to drink?

822
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:09,507
He's like an octopus.

823
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:10,682
He's everywhere
at the same time.

824
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:11,884
Yeah.

825
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,844
Come on, Daniel!

826
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,432
You need space
to let your ego flow!

827
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:56,516
<i>The report posted on Wikileaks, which
details shocking police misconduct,</i>

828
00:50:57,096 --> 00:51:00,726
<i>was dismissed by government
spokesman Alfred Mutua</i>

829
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:06,364
<i>as a front to raise
money from the west.</i>

830
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:08,232
What is this guy talking about?

831
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,447
Just leave it alone.
You know he's a clown.

832
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,320
The Students' Union
are planning a protest

833
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,825
at the university next week.

834
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:16,582
It might take that long
to get there.

835
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,491
We've exposed
death squads in Kenya,

836
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:58,207
a nuclear accident in Iran.

837
00:51:58,324 --> 00:51:59,792
In Iceland,
the government has taken over

838
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:01,039
the Kaupthing Bank.

839
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,537
And the 9/11 pager leak

840
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,254
will have huge
privacy implications.

841
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,748
...our enemies.

842
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,879
Um, <i>WIRED</i> wants a longer piece.

843
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,882
Can you make time
for a one-on-one session?

844
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:13,385
- Absolutely, yeah.
- Great.

845
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,724
Excuse me.

846
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:17,100
Um...

847
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,600
Call me.

848
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,894
- Okay.
- Cool.

849
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:27,069
Look at you! Groupies.

850
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:28,312
She's a reporter.

851
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,864
She's certainly working
an angle.

852
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,662
<i>The victims,
Oscar Kamau Kingara</i>

853
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:42,084
<i>and John Paul Oulu...</i>

854
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,752
<i>had worked closely with
the Kenyan Commission</i>

855
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:44,828
<i>on Human Rights...</i>

856
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,505
<i>on a report
documenting complicity</i>

857
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,503
<i>of the Kenyan Police
in over 400 murders.</i>

858
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,085
<i>The report gained notoriety</i>

859
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,761
<i>after it was published
on the WikiLeaks site.</i>

860
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,844
It can't be just some
mealy-mouthed press release.

861
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:57,345
Kibaki had them murdered.

862
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,184
The language needs
to be stronger.

863
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:02,263
- It's already quite strong.
- Give me the damn computer.

864
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,101
They left their names
in the report.

865
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,186
They wanted the world to know
they stood behind it.

866
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,521
Yes, they wanted
the world to know.

867
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,856
It was a damn fine story.

868
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:13,111
We put it on the front
of the website...

869
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,367
and we couldn't even
get a single paper

870
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,944
outside of Kenya to pick it up.

871
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,620
We're not breaking through.

872
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,542
Those were my friends.

873
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:37,298
If we had publicized
the report better...

874
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,053
then...

875
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,935
they would have been heroes.

876
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:45,393
And there would be too high
a political cost

877
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,311
to murdering them.

878
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:49,060
Kibaki wouldn't have dared.

879
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:52,321
He's a tyrant, Julian.

880
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,322
I don't think more publicity
would have...

881
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:56,571
Oh, what the hell do you know
about publicity?

882
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:00,655
I mean, outside of sucking up
to reporters. It's disgusting.

883
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,906
The woman from <i>WIRED?</i>

884
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,160
I was selling her a story.

885
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,663
Yeah, well, why don't you just
leave that to me?

886
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:13,960
Don't take it
personally. He's just scared.

887
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,462
You should be, too.

888
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,923
Our operating system is secure,

889
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:21,509
our other sources are safe,
we're fine.

890
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:23,135
Really.

891
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:25,929
What?

892
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,477
Do you think our site
is vulnerable?

893
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:32,357
I think you're taking on
presidents, kings, kingpins.

894
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,022
People that can easily afford
the kind of black hats...

895
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:38,868
that get off on breaking into
a "secure" operating system.

896
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:40,698
And believe me,

897
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:43,031
if your OS is anything
less than secure...

898
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,281
it's not gonna take them long

899
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,866
to identify the rest
of the sources...

900
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,538
and to hunt them down.

901
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:49,878
Hey.

902
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,669
Ask for my help, Daniel.

903
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,557
<i>Welcome back to
the most news in the morning.</i>

904
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,138
Yeah.

905
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,186
No. No. Keep your men on.

906
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,138
All right, thank you.

907
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:10,645
<i>...detailing nearly 500,000

908

909
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:13,564
Sarah.

910
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,153
<i>I thought
if I sent you to Cairo,</i>

911
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:16,572
<i>I'd have a moment to myself.</i>

912
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:20,492
The President is busting
my nuts about this UN speech.

913
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:21,823
<i>Turn on CNN.</i>

914
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:23,245
<i>WikiLeaks will not
say if the source</i>

915
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:24,989
<i>was in government,

00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,915
<i>industry,

<i>with the capability

918
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,670
<i>Privacy experts are not pleased</i>

919
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,747
<i>to see personal
communications released...</i>

920
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:36,334
<i>and even less pleased
that they were collected...</i>

921
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:40,091
<i>and then stored

922
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:44,182
<i>At 8:45, the first plane

923
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:48,429
<i>By 8:50, the first texts
indicating something is wrong.</i>

924
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:51,273
<i>WikiLeaks says it has verified
some of the texts...</i>

925
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,442
<i>and believes
they all are authentic.</i>

926
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:55,940
These are the guys
that skewered Palin?

927
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,779
And the Iranian
nuclear program,

928
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:00,024
Petroperú, Bank Julius Bar.

929
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:02,360
<i>Right, we just indicted
the bankers.</i>

930
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:03,865
Do they have an agenda?

931
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,447
Truth, justice,
the American way.

932
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:11,786
Sam, it's half a million
text messages.

933
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,955
Who has the capacity to track
that many pager services?

934
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,468
You think the leak
came from us?

935
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,470
<i>The CIA's concerned,
they have a man on it.</i>

936
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:24,636
<i>We think it's time
we get the Pentagon involved.</i>

937
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,305
Why are you guys at State
always so trigger-happy?

938
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:30,062
<i>It's just a website, right?
It's not a terrorist cell.</i>

939
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,229
<i>Why don't I call Justice?</i>

940
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,228
Justice will tell you there's
a First Amendment issue.

941
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,063
And even if there weren't...

942
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,645
this site has mirrors outside
the U.S. It's beyond the law.

943
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,487
I don't even know
what that means.

944
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:41,573
<i>It means that the transfer</i>

945
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,571
<i>of information is too easy,
Sam...</i>

946
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,993
<i>and we are not prepared.</i>

947
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:46,995
<i>I mean, you work
for the goddamn White House.</i>

948
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,164
<i>Can you call the Pentagon,
please?</i>

949
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,242
Thank you.

950
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,669
Okay. I'm gonna be called

951
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:57,005
into this Mubarak meeting
as soon as we land.

952
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,590
Can you brief me
on this source?

953
00:56:58,665 --> 00:56:59,837
Yeah.

954
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,296
Tarek Haliseh.

955
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:05,763
Yeah.

956
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,012
Senior defense advisor
to Gaddafi.

957
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,973
<i>The program code is a mess.</i>

958
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:16,604
There are ways
to trace your sources.

959
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,357
They aren't protected nearly
as well as you say they are.

960
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,572
You let him
on the primary server?

961
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,824
He could have hacked it
himself. That's the point.

962
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,110
We need help.

963
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:28,696
We need to be careful
who we trust.

964
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,163
I've known Marcus for years.

965
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:31,615
We knew Birgitta
all of five minutes

966
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,371
- when you asked her to...
- I asked her.

967
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:34,869
I have experience
with these things,

968
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,040
and I don't make mistakes.

969
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,538
Well, at least not usually.

970
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:39,290
We made a promise
to our sources...

971
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:42,001
You made a promise to me!

972
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:44,178
Hey. You might want
to get backstage.

973
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:45,424
There are two guys
sniffing around,

974
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,388
real Patriot Act types.

975
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,232
According to
The Guardian,

976
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:59,814
<i>we had more scoops
in three years...</i>

977
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:03,193
<i>than The Washington Post
has had in 30.</i>

978
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:07,235
<i>We have exposed corruption
in dozens of countries.</i>

979
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:09,490
<i>Have a look.</i>

980
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:16,136
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

981
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,149
<i>It's working.</i>

982
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,772
<i>Please.</i>

983
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,978
<i>I grew up in the East.</i>

984
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,153
<i>Even if you wrote a letter
about a broken sewer pipe...</i>

985
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,484
<i>we were watched.</i>

986
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:33,787
<i>Maybe interrogated,
thrown in jail.</i>

987
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,661
<i>I think, Mr. Assange...</i>

988
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,413
<i>if we had someone like you...</i>

989
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:43,331
<i>the Wall would have
come down years before.</i>

990
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:49,795
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

991
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:52,760
<i>Thank you.</i>

992
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,933
<i>This lady really
defines the essence</i>

993
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,851
<i>of what we're trying
to achieve.</i>

994
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,096
<i>Privacy for the individual,</i>

995
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:01,181
<i>transparency
for institutions...</i>

996
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:04,317
<i>with your personal safety
as a whistleblower...</i>

997
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,394
<i>guaranteed through anonymity.</i>

998
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:08,814
<i>Of course,
when you seek to protect,</i>

999
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:10,865
<i>there are those
who seek to destroy.</i>

1000
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:12,284
<i>But we...</i>

1001
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:17,323
<i>We make a promise
to our sources.</i>

1002
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,163
<i>Which is why we are continually</i>

1003
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:22,290
<i>adding qualified partners...</i>

1004
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:25,251
<i>to strengthen our team.</i>

1005
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:30,340
<i>You can change the world
with a great idea...</i>

1006
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:33,179
<i>but you can't do it alone.</i>

1007
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,678
<i>You need people.</i>

1008
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:40,725
<i>People willing to put
themselves on the line.</i>

1009
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:59,372
if you just email Daniel.
Thank you so much.

1010
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,620
Look at the PayPal account.
It's thousands of euros.

1011
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,044
Oh, we should buy some
mistletoe to celebrate under.

1012
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:06,292
Or we can upgrade servers
and get new laptops.

1013
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,624
Or we could do that.
Yawn, yawn.

1014
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,549
See you guys at the party.

1015
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:14,967
- Mr. and Mrs. Berg.
- Hello.

1016
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,841
Daniel didn't tell me
you were coming.

1017
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:20,518
We kept reading
about you in the papers.

1018
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:23,684
Can you join us for dinner?

1019
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,650
- Julian is very busy...
- I'd love to.

1020
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,440
That's marvelous.

1021
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,953
That was taken in Belgium.

1022
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,373
I organized the competitions.

1023
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,962
We traveled to Dusseldorf,
Geneva...

1024
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,127
Remember
that boy he beat in Prague?

1025
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,046
He was so big.

1026
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,052
She means he was fat and slow.

1027
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,809
By the way,
have you seen these?

1028
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:03,887
Papa...

1029
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,974
Schmitt! Don't ruin my papers.

1030
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:09,567
Get off that!
Always sitting on my papers.

1031
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:11,941
He's been keeping
all the articles.

1032
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:15,274
There was this one piece
on Julius Bar in the F.A.Z.

1033
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:18,569
it was really wonderful.

1034
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:22,326
We don't really
bother with the local papers.

1035
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:24,825
It's a national paper.

1036
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,832
Some collection
you've got there.

1037
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:33,007
Yeah.

1038
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,085
Quite the anarchist, hmm?

1039
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,591
Oddest thing.

1040
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:44,428
I didn't meet
my biological father

1041
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:46,855
until I was in my twenties.

1042
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:51,314
I walked into his house,
and there on the shelves...

1043
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:55,106
Kafka, Kropotkin, Solzhenitsyn.

1044
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:00,657
All these books I'd spent years

1045
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,705
trying to discover on my own.

1046
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:11,171
Perhaps you'd like
to borrow one.

1047
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,131
Where's the bathroom?

1048
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:24,467
Over there.

1049
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:37,406
He takes his backpack
to the bathroom?

1050
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,487
Security.

1051
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:50,869
Let's eat.

1052
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,390
Hey.

1053
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:14,939
That wasn't cool.

1054
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:20,532
Sorry.

1055
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,452
- See you later.
- Later!

1056
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,571
Bye!

1057
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:29,245
Yeah.

1058
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,285
I clean lost my appetite.

1059
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:37,087
But you have to admit
they are a bit suffocating.

1060
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:38,754
What?

1061
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,886
Oh, you haven't
picked up on that?

1062
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,631
Well, I suppose we all have
our own unique way

1063
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:46,303
of viewing the world.

1064
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,135
For example,
here's an interesting one.

1065
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:50,767
Did you see it,
the new <i>WIRED</i> piece?

1066
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:55,316
"Cofounder Daniel Schmitt
got involved

1067
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:56,980
"with WikiLeaks
prior to launch."

1068
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:59,901
I didn't say that. Julian,
the reporter screwed up.

1069
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:02,732
Maybe you're used to people
exaggerating your successes...

1070
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,818
but while you were
out winning judo trophies

1071
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:06,160
with Mutti and Vati...

1072
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:08,325
I was studying
information systems

1073
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:10,157
in a shitty squat
outside Melbourne...

1074
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,993
obsessing over code in
a hot little flat in Paris...

1075
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,120
and holding schizophrenic
meetings with myself...

1076
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:20,175
the chairman, the secretary,
sole volunteer, and founder...

1077
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:24,926
of an organization
no one had even heard of!

1078
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:26,840
Including you.

1079
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,098
Oh, no, wait, Daniel,
but there's more to this.

1080
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,429
It gets better.

1081
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:38,192
"Daniel Schmitt,
he won't give his real name.

1082
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:42,523
"No, instead, he adopted
the nom de plume 'Schmitt'

1083
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,357
"after his cat."

1084
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:47,531
To think,
I spent weeks reading Horace

1085
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:48,778
to find the right
<i>nom de guerre...</i>

1086
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:51,035
when all I needed
was a fucking cat.

1087
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:57,208
Sorry. Uh, you're
the leaks guy, right?

1088
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:58,375
From the Congress?

1089
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,128
- You need volunteers?
- Hmm.

1090
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:02,334
Oh, we have hundreds
of volunteers.

1091
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:07,806
But we could always do
with more loyal followers.

1092
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:09,641
Oh, great.
I'm Ziggy.

1093
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:12,310
- Good to meet you, Ziggy.
- Good to meet you.

1094
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,148
Hey, Daniel.

1095
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,074
Listen, I just need five
minutes. I'll be all right.

1096
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,823
- Don't worry about it.
- Just a cup of coffee.

1097
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:30,904
But Julian wants me to take
you guys to the airport!

1098
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:32,372
Julian can go fuck himself!

1099
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:10,576
This represents
the full stockpile?

1100
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,703
There's been some
effort to comply

1101
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:14,452
with the Chemical Weapons
Convention...

1102
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:17,451
but there is no way they will
be able to destroy it all

1103
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,122
before the deadline.

1104
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:24,586
Is this Gaddafi dragging
his heels, or his son?

1105
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:25,875
It's not clear.

1106
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:28,803
But Mutassim is ambitious.

1107
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:30,304
His brother is out of favor...

1108
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,802
and this could be an attempt
to cast himself

1109
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:33,633
as a possible successor
to his father.

1110
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,135
That's just what we need.

1111
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,141
Another madman
with mustard gas.

1112
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,573
Do you remember that
New Year's Eve party

1113
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:54,654
in Sharm el-Sheikh?

1114
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:57,494
I'd just started my Fulbright,
I'd had a bit to drink.

1115
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:59,583
A lot to drink.

1116
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:01,916
Your brother begged
you to leave

1117
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:03,338
the drunk American
at the party...

1118
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:04,665
but you stayed.

1119
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:07,668
Someone had to keep
an eye on her.

1120
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:12,514
D.C. is a nice place
to raise a child.

1121
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:15,637
You have a family now.

1122
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:18,974
I want you to do what's best
for your family.

1123
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,858
Tripoli is my home.

1124
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:27,608
I am doing what's best
for my family.

1125
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:34,444
Why don't we order something?

1126
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:37,956
<i>The spread
of information is forming</i>

1127
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:40,534
<i>a new nervous system
for our planet.</i>

1128
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:42,618
<i>We recognize that</i>

1129
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:44,955
<i>the world's information
infrastructure...</i>

1130
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:47,791
<i>will become what
we and others make of it.</i>

1131
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:50,218
So, you think
this is good intel, huh?

1132
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:53,297
I've known Tarek
for over 20 years.

1133
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:57,350
Okay. Write up a cable.

1134
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:00,562
I want everybody on the
Middle East desk up to speed.

1135
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,038
Hey.

1136
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:32,343
I never thought
you'd become a rock star.

1137
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:35,926
I think rock stars
have cooler tattoos.

1138
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:37,719
You should have heard Julian.

1139
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:40,093
"Compensating for something?"

1140
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,515
I didn't care.

1141
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:48,355
It wasn't for him anyways.

1142
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:53,944
He's an asshole, Daniel.

1143
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,116
He's a manipulative asshole.

1144
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,070
He must be.

1145
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:03,082
Why else would I have given up
everything I cared about?

1146
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,295
What you've done...

1147
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,296
it's staggering.

1148
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:15,795
But you did it together.

1149
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:18,632
Sure, Julian
is the mad prophet,

1150
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,725
but he needs boundaries.

1151
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:22,727
He needs a line.

1152
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:26,230
You're that line.

1153
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:44,457
<i>We all want
information to be free.</i>

1154
01:10:45,283 --> 01:10:49,663
But investigative journalism
is pricy.

1155
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,002
And when newspapers
get squeezed,

1156
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:53,833
it's the first thing to go...

1157
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:57,007
which is why providers of
first-rate source material...

1158
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:59,256
like WikiLeaks,
are so important.

1159
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:01,090
Nick, is Assange
ever gonna show?

1160
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:04,931
I had a message,
I think he's been delayed.

1161
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:07,639
Passport control
can be such a bore.

1162
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,607
Apparently,
they're not big fans

1163
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:11,355
of first-rate
source material, so...

1164
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:24,785
<i>What we witnessed</i>

1165
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:26,958
was the brutal breakdown
of the rule of law...

1166
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:29,035
and destruction
of public property

1167
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,878
as acted out by the police.

1168
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:33,544
I was so frightened, I thought
my hair might turn white.

1169
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:37,551
The only way we could actually
get back into the compound...

1170
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,220
was to ask the police,

1171
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:41,055
that we were trying to expose
as being corrupt,

1172
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,552
to let us in.

1173
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:45,135
The real reason
I was late today was, uh...

1174
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:47,141
we have it on good authority
that we're being tracked

1175
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,642
by CIA operatives...

1176
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,223
and there were
definitely two types.

1177
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:52,308
- Oh.
- Which we had to shake.

1178
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:54,564
An international man
of mystery, huh?

1179
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:57,484
I've used that line.

1180
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:58,564
Next he'll be telling you

1181
01:11:58,648 --> 01:11:59,991
the spooks kidnapped
his partner.

1182
01:12:00,358 --> 01:12:01,359
Partner?

1183
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,569
Daniel, the German chap.
The grounded one.

1184
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:06,239
The one who helps you
distinguish fact from fiction.

1185
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,327
WikiLeaks has hundreds
of volunteers.

1186
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,754
It's very difficult to keep
track of any single one.

1187
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:16,583
Well, do try to
keep track of me.

1188
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:17,875
Excuse me.

1189
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:32,231
So, what's this new leak
you're sitting on?

1190
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:36,019
It must be big if it's piqued
the interest of the CIA.

1191
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,025
So, you do believe me?

1192
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:41,233
No, no, no. I didn't.

1193
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:43,776
Until I noticed your friends.

1194
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:47,113
Let's not attract attention.

1195
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,783
The American spooks
are relatively civilized.

1196
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:52,790
It's the Russians you should
be keeping an eye on.

1197
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:57,957
Room 376.

1198
01:12:58,291 --> 01:12:59,964
When Ms. Lang returns,
bring her up,

1199
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,965
they'll assume
you're in for the night.

1200
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:05,132
That will give us plenty
of time to find a way

1201
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,557
to slip you out of the hotel...

1202
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:07,975
and for you to show
me what it is

1203
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:09,810
that's got their knickers
in such a twist.

1204
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:14,148
Anyway.
Good night.

1205
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:15,565
Good night.

1206
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:16,984
Good night.

1207
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:02,855
Yeah?

1208
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:05,783
I need you. Can you get on
the first plane to Reykjavik?

1209
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:08,862
Christ, I'm surprised they
don't have more men on you.

1210
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:10,322
I thought you were in Norway.

1211
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:12,031
It's not safe for me
to stay here anymore.

1212
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:13,123
<i>What's going on?</i>

1213
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:14,701
They'll have a taxi here in 20.

1214
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,957
It'll be by the back entrance.
The Americans are out front.

1215
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:18,834
Julian, Julian, you should
work with us on this.

1216
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:22,626
Why? So that The Guardian
can pick up some more awards?

1217
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:30,174
What are you doing?

1218
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,553
if I'm gonna get
out of this hotel,

1219
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:35,555
I'm gonna need a disguise.

1220
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:37,060
Oh.

1221
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:53,243
<i>That's a weapon.</i>

1222
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:58,582
<i>I see your element.</i>

1223
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:01,331
<i>You got about four Humvees
out along this...</i>

1224
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:02,506
<i>You're clear.</i>

1225
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:04,083
<i>All right, firing.</i>

1226
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,252
<i>Let me know when you get them.</i>

1227
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,343
<i>Light 'em all up.</i>

1228
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:10,931
<i>Come on. Fire.</i>

1229
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:15,011
<i>Roger.</i>

1230
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,352
<i>Keep shooting.</i>

1231
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:21,601
<i>Keep shooting.</i>

1232
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:26,443
<i>Target hit. It was a missile.</i>

1233
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:29,697
<i>Appears to be
wounded, trying to crawl away.</i>

1234
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:30,947
<i>He's getting up.</i>

1235
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:32,703
<i>Maybe he has
a weapon down in his hand?</i>

1236
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:34,121
<i>No, no,
I haven't seen one yet.</i>

1237
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,364
<i>I see you guys got that guy</i>

1238
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:36,791
<i>crawling right now on the curb?</i>

1239
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:38,625
<i>Yeah, I got
him, I put two rounds of...</i>

1240
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:40,541
<i>Individuals
going to the scene...</i>

1241
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:41,620
<i>Jesus.</i>

1242
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,297
<i>...possibly picking up bodies
and weapons.</i>

1243
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,373
<i>Coming around. Clear.</i>

1244
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:46,300
<i>Roger.
I lost them in the dust.</i>

1245
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:47,794
<i>- I got 'em.</i>

1246
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:54,633
<i>Oh, yeah, look at that,</i>

1247
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:55,969
<i>right through the windshield.</i>

1248
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:58,221
<i>Look at those dead bastards.</i>

1249
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:00,898
Were they even armed?

1250
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:02,975
With cameras, mainly.

1251
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,979
Two of the victims
were Reuters employees.

1252
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,072
A cameraman and his driver.

1253
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:10,741
The military said
they died in a battle

1254
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:12,489
between U.S. forces
and insurgents...

1255
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,491
and the press just bought it.

1256
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:16,285
Didn't Reuters chase the story?

1257
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:20,494
The Pentagon stonewalled them.
It's a massive cover-up.

1258
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:22,169
This is huge.

1259
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:25,081
I think this is gonna
change everything.

1260
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:27,292
Traffic, donations.

1261
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,674
I want to call it
"Collateral Murder."

1262
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:36,926
- That's a bit loaded.
- Don't you think it should be?

1263
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,431
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

1264
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:40,184
We have to make sure
it's legitimate.

1265
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,263
Where did you get it?

1266
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:43,349
A guy showed up in the chat,
said he was U.S. military.

1267
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:46,106
But we should track down
the families of the victims.

1268
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:47,357
In Baghdad?

1269
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,359
Yes, in Baghdad.

1270
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:52,111
We are journalists.
We have to verify our sources.

1271
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:54,193
Maybe you should
look into flights.

1272
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:57,538
We'll have to preprocess,
improve resolution.

1273
01:16:57,655 --> 01:17:00,829
We can use FFmpegs
and toss it into Final Cut.

1274
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:04,128
I know some guys who've done
this thing, at RUV.

1275
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:06,379
Good.

1276
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:13,174
<i>Target 15 coming at you.</i>

1277
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:14,426
<i>It's a guy with a weapon.</i>

1278
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:16,641
Good.
Now add some buzz over that.

1279
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:19,385
Twenty, again.

1280
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:22,681
Radio frequency
in the military comms.

1281
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:23,855
Okay.

1282
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:25,308
<i>All right, firing.</i>

1283
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:26,850
<i>Okay, I got it.</i>

1284
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,106
<i>Last conversation, Hotel...</i>

1285
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:31,776
<i>Roger, Hotel Two-Six.</i>

1286
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:55,759
I've heard people say

1287
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:58,466
that I dangle on the autistic
spectrum.

1288
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:04,605
It's probably why I lean
so heavily on those around me.

1289
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:07,816
Yeah.

1290
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:11,107
We need to set up
a media launch.

1291
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:12,271
Yeah.

1292
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:15,028
Ziggy is planning something
at the Parliament building.

1293
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:16,776
Ziggy?
- Mmm-hmm.

1294
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:22,581
You want to launch the
biggest leak we've ever had

1295
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:23,703
in Iceland?

1296
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:27,161
Let's take the fight to them.

1297
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:30,331
Courage is contagious.

1298
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:32,716
Right?

1299
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:49,650
<i>The video shows
the brutal slaughter</i>

1300
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:52,190
<i>of two Reuters reporters.</i>

1301
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:55,147
Here, we have
firsthand evidence

1302
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:57,866
<i>of the barbarity of war.</i>

1303
01:18:58,484 --> 01:19:02,330
<i>A man, going to drop
his children at school...</i>

1304
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:06,325
<i>sees another man bleeding
to death on the pavement.</i>

1305
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:11,210
<i>He stops to aid this civilian
and in the process is killed.</i>

1306
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:14,667
<i>And his vehicle
turned 180 degrees...</i>

1307
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:17,090
<i>by the sheer force
of the Apache helicopter's</i>

1308
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:18,842
<i>30-millimeter bullets...</i>

1309
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:20,593
<i>ripping into the side
of the vehicle...</i>

1310
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:24,894
<i>miraculously not killing
the two children inside.</i>

1311
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:27,851
<i>The website is calling
this "Collateral Murder."</i>

1312
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:30,020
<i>Captain Nash,
is that a fair description</i>

1313
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,608
<i>of the job our troops
are doing?</i>

1314
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:36,315
<i>If you are embedding with
terrorists in a combat zone...</i>

1315
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:39,367
<i>and those terrorists get
engaged and you get killed,</i>

1316
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:40,868
<i>it is not murder.</i>

1317
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:44,868
if you don't want
ugly pictures,

1318
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:46,036
you should stay out
of ugly wars.

1319
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:49,706
I've got the Deputy NSA
for you.

1320
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:57,092
Twelve million people have
seen that video on YouTube.

1321
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:58,176
Do you still want to tell me

1322
01:19:58,252 --> 01:19:59,504
you think it's just
a little website?

1323
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:01,554
General Thomason
is reviewing intel.

1324
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:03,265
<i>I told him to pull you in.</i>

1325
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:05,889
I'm on in five,
do you have anything for me?

1326
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:07,219
The guy on Fox is pretty good.

1327
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:08,687
Maybe you should use
some of his material.

1328
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:10,935
Sam.

1329
01:20:11,098 --> 01:20:13,066
<i>This is Jim.
Just tell them the truth.</i>

1330
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:15,060
The soldiers
were following protocol.

1331
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:18,569
This is computer geeks looking
at the war through a pinhole.

1332
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:19,948
Well, these computer geeks
are starting

1333
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:21,533
to become a real nuisance, Jim.

1334
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:24,236
Welcome to the revolution.

1335
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:04,530
"Assange,
disheveled like a bag lady

1336
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:05,736
"walking in off the street...

1337
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:07,537
"He smelled as if
he hadn't bathed...

1338
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:10,241
"Changes cell phones daily."

1339
01:21:10,324 --> 01:21:11,496
I mean...

1340
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:14,620
<i>A couple of days
of serious analysis...</i>

1341
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:17,373
<i>and then it's just all about
how weird I am.</i>

1342
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:19,083
You must have
enjoyed Keller's diatribe

1343
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:20,793
on your filthy white socks.

1344
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:23,463
<i>Yes, but I hadn't figured...</i>

1345
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,468
<i>that, you know,</i>

1346
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:27,970
<i>brutal slaughter
and the state of my socks...</i>

1347
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:30,144
<i>would get equal billing
in The New York Times.</i>

1348
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:36,058
Hello.

1349
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:41,151
Ziggy.

1350
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:42,698
Christ, they're gonna kill us.

1351
01:21:42,773 --> 01:21:44,446
<i>Get off Skype.
Get off everything, now.</i>

1352
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:46,785
Turn the phones off!

1353
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:50,698
Guys, we're going
to have to shut down

1354
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:51,828
everything right now.

1355
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,159
You all have
five seconds to save.

1356
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:54,539
- Five seconds!
- What's going on, Marcus?

1357
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:56,040
We cannot let them trace us.

1358
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,667
I just spoke to Kim Zetter.

1359
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,498
She said the U.S. Military
arrested a private

1360
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:00,924
for leaking secrets to us.

1361
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:02,046
The video?

1362
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:05,011
This is the guy
who leaked the video?

1363
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,430
She said
it was more than that.

1364
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:08,515
Half a million classified
U.S. Army documents

1365
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:09,716
and hundreds of thousands...

1366
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,552
of internal communiqués from
the U.S. State Department.

1367
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:12,932
This is the biggest leak

1368
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:14,809
of classified information
in history.

1369
01:22:21,019 --> 01:22:22,316
Oh, my God.

1370
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,402
You're telling me
that this private

1371
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:29,862
stuck a thumb drive
in a computer?

1372
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:30,946
It was a CD.

1373
01:22:31,572 --> 01:22:33,791
- Excuse me?
- It was a blank CD.

1374
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:35,960
It was marked "Lady Gaga."

1375
01:22:38,996 --> 01:22:41,090
- Where's the Secretary?
- Jim's calling her now.

1376
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:42,963
Do we know which documents
Manning leaked?

1377
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,173
He's refusing to talk.

1378
01:22:45,252 --> 01:22:47,755
We think it's war logs
from Afghanistan and Iraq.

1379
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:50,091
And cables
from the NCD database.

1380
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:51,892
Which cables?

1381
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,472
Which cables?

1382
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,226
He may have leaked
the whole database.

1383
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:03,987
That's a quarter
of a million cables.

1384
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:08,617
They can read like
the diary of a 12-year-old.

1385
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:11,320
You know, personal,
frank, rude comments...

1386
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:13,121
about every president
and prime minister alive.

1387
01:23:13,197 --> 01:23:14,665
This is a diplomatic nightmare.

1388
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:16,242
Excuse me, but who gives a shit

1389
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:17,577
about diplomacy right now?

1390
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,333
The military logs expose
hundreds of informants.

1391
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:21,538
There are lives at risk.

1392
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:25,585
Sam, he's right.

1393
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:33,892
A 22-year-old private

1394
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:36,016
with a history
of mental instability...

1395
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:38,267
and a Lady Gaga CD...

1396
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:41,476
and we're on the verge of
a major international crisis.

1397
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:45,237
He bragged about it
in a chat room.

1398
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:46,780
What the hell was he thinking?

1399
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,528
He's a kid.
He's 22.

1400
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:50,492
Are you sure
they can't trace us?

1401
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:52,031
I'm adding another Tor circuit.

1402
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:54,112
Wipe my portion
from the hard drive.

1403
01:23:54,196 --> 01:23:56,198
Well, if you have them,
then they know about it.

1404
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:58,534
I know. I got to go.

1405
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:04,961
- Are we back up yet?
- Just a few more proxies.

1406
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:07,171
The whole mission
is to protect sources.

1407
01:24:07,251 --> 01:24:09,379
We can't protect them
from themselves.

1408
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:11,884
We're online.

1409
01:24:11,964 --> 01:24:13,090
See if Julian's on chat.

1410
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,671
Shit! He's got them.

1411
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:53,846
How did he not tell us?

1412
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:05,067
That is three gigs of text.

1413
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:08,312
This is crazy.

1414
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:20,991
Tell him
we can't dump the data.

1415
01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:23,076
It's too dangerous.
Tell him!

1416
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:28,791
We need time
to go through it all.

1417
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:50,650
Prick.

1418
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:55,113
Come on.

1419
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:16,050
Fuck you, you disloyal fuck!

1420
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:41,575
Shit!

1421
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:44,283
Guys, look at this.

1422
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:47,002
<i>Julian Assange
is engaged in terrorism.</i>

1423
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,421
<i>He should be treated
as an enemy combatant.</i>

1424
01:26:49,496 --> 01:26:50,622
<i>WikiLeaks should be closed down</i>

1425
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:51,798
<i>permanently and decisively.</i>

1426
01:26:55,419 --> 01:26:56,966
Nick, how can I help you?

1427
01:26:57,254 --> 01:26:59,222
Can you put me
in touch with Julian?

1428
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:00,807
Julian's not available.

1429
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:04,136
Daniel, we both
know you're sitting

1430
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:06,017
on the biggest story
on the planet right now.

1431
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:07,473
And if you're thinking
of going to ground on this,

1432
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:08,978
it's too late.
The cat's out of the bag.

1433
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:11,644
<i>Bradley Manning's
future and yours</i>

1434
01:27:11,727 --> 01:27:13,821
<i>depend on how this
material is handled.</i>

1435
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:15,147
Now, I want you to tell Julian

1436
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,652
I'm already working
on a story...

1437
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:19,201
to paint this as the next
Pentagon Papers.

1438
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:20,994
But you need our help.

1439
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:22,366
It's the biggest thing
you've ever done.

1440
01:27:22,446 --> 01:27:23,538
<i>And if you think they spun you</i>

1441
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:24,990
<i>on the Collateral
Murder video...</i>

1442
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:26,495
<i>wait till you see
what they do here.</i>

1443
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:29,328
Tell Julian
this is all about survival.

1444
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:30,996
I'll get back to you.

1445
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:35,501
Where's Julian flying in to?

1446
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,686
Julian.

1447
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,396
Did anyone follow you?

1448
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,198
No, no, no, I don't think so.

1449
01:27:58,565 --> 01:28:00,283
What's he doing here?

1450
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:02,611
- I told you to come alone.
- You need to hear him out.

1451
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:05,698
They're looking for us, and
they got people everywhere.

1452
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:21,221
Daniel Ellsberg
put out a statement.

1453
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:22,718
He said
they're coming after us.

1454
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:24,175
We need to publish now.

1455
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:27,261
It's hundreds of thousands of
pages of sensitive material.

1456
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:28,516
It's not like the video.

1457
01:28:28,678 --> 01:28:30,772
The docs are full of jargon,
they're totally impenetrable.

1458
01:28:31,097 --> 01:28:33,099
We wouldn't know what the hell
we were publishing.

1459
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:35,401
So, we let
the historians decide.

1460
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:37,821
I thought the whole point
of this organization

1461
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:39,864
was to publish in full.

1462
01:28:41,775 --> 01:28:43,903
I thought the point
was protecting whistleblowers.

1463
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:09,595
Can I speak to Nick Davies,
please?

1464
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:15,267
<i>Don't get me wrong.</i>

1465
01:29:15,392 --> 01:29:16,689
You should still
keep an eye out

1466
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:17,860
for men with poison umbrellas.

1467
01:29:17,936 --> 01:29:19,938
But if the U.S.
has any foresight,

1468
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:21,189
they know they need
to do more...

1469
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:23,116
than kill you.
They need to delegitimize

1470
01:29:23,233 --> 01:29:24,234
everything you stand for.

1471
01:29:24,401 --> 01:29:26,369
You represent
a terrifying future.

1472
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:28,867
Right now, the most
powerful media machine

1473
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:30,290
on the entire planet...

1474
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:33,960
is planning a smear campaign
like nothing you've ever seen.

1475
01:29:37,289 --> 01:29:39,132
Amazing how someone
could talk for 10 minutes

1476
01:29:39,249 --> 01:29:41,377
without actually
saying anything.

1477
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:42,802
You said
you would hear him out.

1478
01:29:42,878 --> 01:29:44,130
What are you proposing?

1479
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:46,131
An international
media coalition

1480
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:48,467
legitimizing you
as a news organization.

1481
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:51,307
Let the U.S. attack.
We print the news.

1482
01:29:51,761 --> 01:29:53,479
And if we put you on
the moral high ground...

1483
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:55,649
with Mother Teresa,
with Nelson Mandela...

1484
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:57,146
No one will be able
to fuck with us.

1485
01:29:57,434 --> 01:29:59,061
But they'd still get
their exclusives.

1486
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:02,068
Look, finding stories
in all these documents...

1487
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:03,399
that's a lot of work,
it's a lot of time.

1488
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:05,825
You can't expect us to do it
without an incentive.

1489
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:07,740
And then what? We set a date?

1490
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:09,787
You run your stories,
we post the raw data.

1491
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:12,991
Obviously, all these documents
have names,

1492
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:14,493
sources, U.S. informants.

1493
01:30:14,618 --> 01:30:16,120
You'll need to redact them.

1494
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:18,338
But WikiLeaks doesn't edit.

1495
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:20,586
That's all very well,

1496
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:22,588
but <i>The Guardian</i>
can't be seen to condone...

1497
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:25,671
publishing something
that puts lives in danger.

1498
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:29,428
And morals aside, it's about
how you're perceived.

1499
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:33,095
You're starting
an information war

1500
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:35,180
with the United States
Government.

1501
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:37,478
You mustn't hand
them ammunition.

1502
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:48,527
I suppose
it is just a name search.

1503
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:56,209
Well, look, that's my editor.
What should I say?

1504
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:57,877
How secure are your phones?

1505
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:03,458
Alan.

1506
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:04,963
<i>So, do we have a deal?</i>

1507
01:31:05,043 --> 01:31:06,886
No, no, no,
it's a complete cock-up.

1508
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:07,963
He won't talk to me.

1509
01:31:08,046 --> 01:31:09,047
<i>Let me talk to him, then.</i>

1510
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:10,890
I can't.
Listen, I'll get back to you.

1511
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:12,388
Julian...

1512
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:15,645
this kind of coverage
gets people's attention.

1513
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:18,732
It could be the culmination
of everything we've done.

1514
01:31:32,237 --> 01:31:34,410
This is a code
to a temporary site.

1515
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:36,908
I'll send you the link
in 24 hours.

1516
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:41,083
You'll find the war logs there.

1517
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:44,253
So, it's a deal?

1518
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:46,092
We publish, you publish.

1519
01:31:46,376 --> 01:31:48,595
We redact, you redact.

1520
01:31:51,673 --> 01:31:53,425
We'll put out the war logs
in six weeks.

1521
01:31:55,802 --> 01:31:58,806
If you behave,
we'll move on to the cables.

1522
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:02,438
Great.

1523
01:32:06,146 --> 01:32:07,193
Well, a coalition government

1524
01:32:07,272 --> 01:32:08,694
will have a certain
honeymoon period.

1525
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:10,616
But, selling off the
post office? I mean that...

1526
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:12,865
Good morning, everyone.
The meeting is over.

1527
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:15,288
Alan, I'm sorry. I told Nick.

1528
01:32:15,947 --> 01:32:17,949
Get me Bill Keller
at <i>The Times,</i>

1529
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:19,876
and what's-his-fuck
at Der Spiegel.

1530
01:32:22,704 --> 01:32:23,796
Alan?

1531
01:32:24,748 --> 01:32:27,376
I'm sorry, folks, we're gonna
have to break this up.

1532
01:32:37,761 --> 01:32:39,638
Door? Yeah.

1533
01:32:45,268 --> 01:32:47,487
He's pretty slow
for a tech wizard.

1534
01:32:48,438 --> 01:32:51,408
He said it's 91,000 logs
from Afghanistan alone.

1535
01:32:51,483 --> 01:32:53,326
I imagine
that might take a second.

1536
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:04,629
All right, here we go.
Look at that.

1537
01:33:05,789 --> 01:33:08,338
<i>Keren, get me Bill Keller
at The New York Times.</i>

1538
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:10,089
And let's be discreet.

1539
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:16,429
The spreadsheet is enormous.

1540
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:18,852
I'm sure it contains
the scoop of the century...

1541
01:33:18,968 --> 01:33:20,845
but we simply cannot access it.

1542
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:23,189
Are you working in Excel?

1543
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:25,858
Every time I open the damn
thing the system crashes.

1544
01:33:25,934 --> 01:33:27,607
You have to parse the data
in a text editor...

1545
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:29,938
and then script it into
a searchable database.

1546
01:33:30,188 --> 01:33:32,532
<i>- Are you getting this?
- Yeah, that helps.</i>

1547
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:35,118
I blew off a profile
with McChrystal in Kabul.

1548
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:36,285
This better be good.

1549
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:38,363
Do you know what
"E.O.F." stands for?

1550
01:33:40,824 --> 01:33:42,701
It's "Escalation of Force."

1551
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:49,040
Can you see that?

1552
01:33:49,374 --> 01:33:50,500
<i>Yeah, got it.</i>

1553
01:33:51,876 --> 01:33:56,222
E.O.F. is
"Escalation of Force."

1554
01:33:58,508 --> 01:34:00,385
Which I believe
means more dead civilians.

1555
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:03,563
The Espionage Act?
You can't be serious.

1556
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,227
If the Attorney General
can show...

1557
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:06,558
he tried to convince a source

1558
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:07,893
to leak
classified information...

1559
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:09,148
You mean like every journalist

1560
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:10,979
who's ever covered
the Pentagon?

1561
01:34:11,062 --> 01:34:13,156
They could indict us
under that rubric.

1562
01:34:13,231 --> 01:34:14,904
I wouldn't be surprised
if they do.

1563
01:34:14,983 --> 01:34:16,656
Nothing draws people to a cause

1564
01:34:16,734 --> 01:34:18,987
like a celebrity martyr, Alan.

1565
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:20,822
That's good, Daniel.
Uh, look...

1566
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:23,495
can you email a list
of whistleblower prizes

1567
01:34:23,575 --> 01:34:24,747
you're putting Manning up for?

1568
01:34:24,909 --> 01:34:26,331
<i>No emailing.
But I can fax you.</i>

1569
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:27,503
Right, of course.
But we need it by Friday

1570
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:29,001
so we can run it in his bio.

1571
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:30,673
Will do. Thanks, Ian.

1572
01:34:30,748 --> 01:34:33,251
And this
Task Force 373 has a hit list

1573
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:34,753
with more than 2,000 names.

1574
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:36,759
Yes, they refer to it
as "stopping birthdays."

1575
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,507
These civilian casualty
numbers are devastating.

1576
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:39,762
It's a shit show.

1577
01:34:39,841 --> 01:34:41,184
I've got the U.K.
ambassador saying

1578
01:34:41,259 --> 01:34:43,512
the campaign isn't under
proper supervision.

1579
01:34:48,558 --> 01:34:50,856
Do you want to talk
to Marcel? Hold on.

1580
01:35:21,299 --> 01:35:22,642
Well, you can sleep
here if you want.

1581
01:35:22,926 --> 01:35:24,269
No, no.

1582
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:27,055
T-minus four.
Are you getting excited?

1583
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:28,435
Sure.

1584
01:35:28,598 --> 01:35:29,815
He must be exhausted.

1585
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:32,481
I mean, the redactions alone...

1586
01:35:32,602 --> 01:35:34,821
it shouldn't take that long.
It's just a name search.

1587
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:40,323
That's what
we initially thought.

1588
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:41,820
But a lot of it is context.

1589
01:35:44,113 --> 01:35:45,330
Nick told Julian...

1590
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:48,164
a tip from the "goat herder
in the red house,"

1591
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:49,415
in small villages...

1592
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:51,250
that's as damning as a name.

1593
01:35:53,665 --> 01:35:55,417
We're only posting
a few hundred of the logs

1594
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:56,968
and we're swimming.

1595
01:35:57,502 --> 01:36:00,301
You'd need an army
to go through all 91,000.

1596
01:36:02,507 --> 01:36:04,180
Thank God you have one.

1597
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:18,773
The story on the generals
would typically be the lead...

1598
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:20,028
but everything's
going out at once

1599
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:21,116
in case there's a gag order.

1600
01:36:21,192 --> 01:36:23,194
We're struggling to keep it
to 14 pages.

1601
01:36:23,653 --> 01:36:25,200
It's talking points
for the morning interviews.

1602
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,623
- Julian.
- What the hell?

1603
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:29,288
I've been trying
to reach you for hours.

1604
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:32,374
I was just sending you a list.

1605
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:34,205
The URLs need
to be standardized,

1606
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:35,461
torrents need seeding.
We need to...

1607
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:37,008
The redactions.

1608
01:36:39,836 --> 01:36:41,634
That was on my list.

1609
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:43,056
It's 91,000 documents,

1610
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:45,554
and our site is publishing
in four days.

1611
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:55,567
Let's go.

1612
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:04,072
What the hell
were you thinking?

1613
01:37:04,152 --> 01:37:05,244
Editing reflects bias.

1614
01:37:05,403 --> 01:37:07,997
We make a promise to our
sources to publish in full.

1615
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:10,416
You lied to everyone we're
working with. You lied to me.

1616
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:12,414
It's funny, you know, I don't
remember you objecting...

1617
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:14,166
to us publishing the names
and addresses

1618
01:37:14,245 --> 01:37:16,418
- of every BNP member.
- This is different.

1619
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:18,166
These sources are fighting
for the very thing

1620
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:19,751
we're supposed to stand for.

1621
01:37:19,876 --> 01:37:22,254
And remind me what that is,
exactly. Hmm?

1622
01:37:22,337 --> 01:37:24,840
Transparency for
powerful organizations...

1623
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:28,517
exposing corruption and
conspiracy wherever it exists.

1624
01:37:28,593 --> 01:37:30,345
We're going to have
to push back publication.

1625
01:37:30,428 --> 01:37:33,352
There's no way we can release
in four days.

1626
01:37:33,431 --> 01:37:35,684
<i>Fourteen pages in The Guardian,</i>

1627
01:37:35,767 --> 01:37:37,440
<i>twelve in The New York Times.</i>

1628
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:40,609
This is more coverage
than all the leaks

1629
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:42,448
we have had, combined.

1630
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:44,946
We are winning
an information war...

1631
01:37:45,068 --> 01:37:46,945
which goes beyond
any short-term alliance

1632
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:48,367
we have with
the mainstream media...

1633
01:37:48,446 --> 01:37:50,289
and you want to throw it
all away because you fear...

1634
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:53,619
that some U.S. Government
informant might come to harm?

1635
01:37:54,077 --> 01:37:56,296
These are human beings, Julian,

1636
01:37:56,454 --> 01:37:57,546
and their lives are at stake.

1637
01:37:57,622 --> 01:38:00,045
What about the lives
of the soldiers...

1638
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:02,718
and the civilians
involved in these conflicts?

1639
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:05,593
Death squads, unreported
civilian casualties,

1640
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,882
countless incidents
of friendly fire.

1641
01:38:07,965 --> 01:38:11,219
This is information
the world needs to know.

1642
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:13,646
So, the next time you find
yourself lecturing me

1643
01:38:13,763 --> 01:38:15,231
about this organization...

1644
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:19,152
please try to remember
why I created it.

1645
01:38:20,478 --> 01:38:23,482
And why I hired you to help me.

1646
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:25,992
Well, that's funny.

1647
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:28,654
I don't remember you hiring me.

1648
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:31,448
I don't recall
a contract or a salary.

1649
01:38:31,823 --> 01:38:34,167
But I guess I should have
known when I met Jay Lim.

1650
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:35,918
There is no organization.

1651
01:38:35,993 --> 01:38:38,587
There's just you
and your ego...

1652
01:38:38,788 --> 01:38:41,587
and the lies you tell to get
whatever the fuck you want.

1653
01:38:46,087 --> 01:38:48,010
You know, it's incredible...

1654
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:52,185
how much time you can spend
with a person...

1655
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,972
and still have no idea
who they are.

1656
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:03,192
You're suspended.
Effective immediately.

1657
01:39:26,419 --> 01:39:27,921
<i>Those are
the most revealing docs.</i>

1658
01:39:28,004 --> 01:39:29,631
<i>Do whatever you can
to keep them off the site.</i>

1659
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:32,058
Okay, thank you, Marcel. Bye.

1660
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,723
Rosenbach said the bulk
of the identifiable sources...

1661
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:36,145
are in the threat assessments.

1662
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:37,847
It's 14,000 documents.

1663
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:39,273
But, if you hold those,

1664
01:39:39,348 --> 01:39:40,600
there are a lot
fewer names in the rest.

1665
01:39:41,058 --> 01:39:42,435
Yeah, I got it.

1666
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:44,687
<i>And remember,</i>

1667
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:46,568
don't tell Julian
that we were talking.

1668
01:39:49,692 --> 01:39:51,490
Are you seeing
the ridiculous crap

1669
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:52,912
<i>he's spouting on the chat?</i>

1670
01:39:56,949 --> 01:39:59,168
<i>Danny, he's completely
out of his mind.</i>

1671
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:01,837
And if he keeps doing this,
we're going to have to quit.

1672
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:03,046
All of us.

1673
01:40:03,122 --> 01:40:05,124
Just take care
of the documents, okay?

1674
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:15,263
Daniel, have you seen this?

1675
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:17,641
He's on Twitter.

1676
01:40:18,763 --> 01:40:21,687
He says that you are FBI,
and that I'm CIA.

1677
01:40:22,517 --> 01:40:23,734
Look.

1678
01:40:34,946 --> 01:40:36,163
This is crazy.

1679
01:40:45,331 --> 01:40:47,379
<i>Der Spiegel is begging
for more time.</i>

1680
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:48,630
<i>The Times wants to go.</i>

1681
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,883
Holger, I've got Nick.

1682
01:40:50,962 --> 01:40:52,179
Ah, great. Five minutes?

1683
01:40:52,296 --> 01:40:53,593
- We have to go.
- Five more minutes.

1684
01:41:05,977 --> 01:41:07,274
<i>Our top story this morning...</i>

1685

we're gonna have to extract.

1709
01:42:03,284 --> 01:42:05,161
Christ,
Putin's gonna go ballistic.

1710
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:08,877
How many more sources
do we have to notify

1711
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:09,957
in the Middle East?

1712
01:42:10,041 --> 01:42:11,964
We're still trying to reach
our contacts in Tehran.

1713
01:42:12,084 --> 01:42:13,506
Okay, good. Keep it up.

1714
01:42:13,586 --> 01:42:14,633
I just talked to Libya,

1715
01:42:14,712 --> 01:42:16,885
they have real concerns
about the ambassador.

1716
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:19,092
We're pulling the ambassador.

1717
01:42:19,175 --> 01:42:21,098
All right,
everybody, listen up!

1718
01:42:21,886 --> 01:42:24,139
I need at least 10 names...

1719
01:42:24,513 --> 01:42:27,733
of high priority sources
who could be harmed...

1720
01:42:27,933 --> 01:42:30,356
if and when these cables
are put out.

1721
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:32,989
If we can claim that Assange
has blood on his hands...

1722
01:42:33,648 --> 01:42:35,616
we can turn this thing around.

1723
01:42:41,489 --> 01:42:42,490
Hi.

1724
01:42:42,865 --> 01:42:44,208
Do you think the President
of Turkmenistan...

1725
01:42:44,283 --> 01:42:45,330
will be more upset that

1726
01:42:45,409 --> 01:42:46,626
I called him
a practiced liar...

1727
01:42:46,702 --> 01:42:48,830
or that I called him vain?

1728
01:42:49,038 --> 01:42:50,665
- I'm sure he's heard worse.
- Hmm.

1729
01:42:50,873 --> 01:42:53,171
"President Berdymukhammedov
does not like people

1730
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:54,342
"smarter than him.

1731
01:42:54,418 --> 01:42:56,967
"Since he's not very bright,

1732
01:42:57,046 --> 01:42:59,014
"he's suspicious
of a lot of people."

1733
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:01,513
Well, he's been around
for a long time.

1734
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:02,844
I don't think he's worried
about the opinions

1735
01:43:02,927 --> 01:43:04,395
of a mid-level foreign attaché

1736
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:06,939
That's why I signed
Hillary's name to it.

1737
01:43:09,016 --> 01:43:10,313
I'll see if <i>The Times</i>
will hold it.

1738
01:43:10,393 --> 01:43:11,736
No, I've got bigger issues.

1739
01:43:11,811 --> 01:43:14,280
No, Sarah,
I am collecting cables

1740
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:15,572
from the head
of every foreign desk.

1741
01:43:15,648 --> 01:43:16,991
Okay, you tell me...
You tell me, then,

1742
01:43:17,066 --> 01:43:18,409
what do I ignore?

1743
01:43:18,693 --> 01:43:19,740
This?

1744
01:43:19,819 --> 01:43:21,913
This destroys
the Sudanese peace talks,

1745
01:43:21,987 --> 01:43:23,864
this screws a source
in Amman...

1746
01:43:23,948 --> 01:43:25,495
<i>The Times</i> will redact
the names.

1747
01:43:26,117 --> 01:43:27,539
Yeah, but,
what about him, will he?

1748
01:43:27,743 --> 01:43:28,915
And don't you tell me

1749
01:43:28,994 --> 01:43:31,747
that your friend Keller's
got him under control.

1750
01:43:31,956 --> 01:43:33,629
He's bigger than The Times.

1751
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:35,543
He can do whatever
the hell he wants.

1752
01:43:35,626 --> 01:43:37,424
Just like he did
with the war logs.

1753
01:43:40,131 --> 01:43:41,633
God.

1754
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:45,561
Any word from Tarek?

1755
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:51,517
He's named in at least
a half a dozen of these.

1756
01:43:51,934 --> 01:43:53,186
Let's bring him in.

1757
01:43:58,566 --> 01:44:00,318
So have you decided
about St. Harts?

1758
01:44:00,484 --> 01:44:02,532
It's a lung flight for a baby.

1759
01:44:02,695 --> 01:44:04,823
That's what a nanny's for.

1760
01:44:05,197 --> 01:44:07,370
You don't have to convince me.

1761
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:22,635
- Hello?
<i>- Doctor Haliseh?</i>

1762
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:29,021
Remember the trip
we once spoke of?

1763
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:38,898
Gentlemen.

1764
01:44:39,023 --> 01:44:40,866
Welcome.

1765
01:44:42,818 --> 01:44:44,411
Please...

1766
01:44:48,532 --> 01:44:49,533
Tarek?

1767
01:44:50,618 --> 01:44:52,211
I left the estimates in the ear.

1768
01:45:29,824 --> 01:45:31,701
You need to go home.

1769
01:45:31,909 --> 01:45:32,956
She's cooking dinner.

1770
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,912
Now! She needs to go now!

1771
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:40,134
We need to pack.

1772
01:45:42,878 --> 01:45:43,925
Everything.

1773
01:45:44,839 --> 01:45:46,887
<i>There are names, operations.</i>

1774
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:50,765
<i>This leak puts
Americans' lives,</i>

1775
01:45:50,886 --> 01:45:53,765
<i>and our allies' lives at risk.</i>

1776
01:45:55,057 --> 01:45:56,604
<i>There is blood on their hands.</i>

1777
01:45:57,017 --> 01:45:58,519
<i>Pentagon officials
are saying today</i>

1778
01:45:58,853 --> 01:46:00,605
<i>that this has been
their fear all along.</i>

1779
01:46:00,729 --> 01:46:02,356
<i>That, if those names
were revealed,</i>

1780
01:46:02,439 --> 01:46:04,066
<i>those people would
become targets.</i>

1781
01:46:04,525 --> 01:46:06,448
<i>Mr. Assange
can say whatever he likes...</i>

1782
01:46:06,527 --> 01:46:08,450
<i>about the greater good
he thinks</i>

1783
01:46:08,529 --> 01:46:10,031
<i>he and his source are doing...</i>

1784
01:46:10,114 --> 01:46:12,617
<i>but they might already
have on their hands</i>

1785
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:14,543
<i>the blood of some
young soldier...</i>

1786
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:17,041
<i>or that of an Afghan family.</i>

1787
01:46:17,246 --> 01:46:18,714
For more, we're joined here

1788
01:46:18,789 --> 01:46:20,712
<i>in our New York studio
by Daniel Ellsberg.</i>

1789
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,634
<i>In terms
of "blood on their hands"...</i>

1790
01:46:22,751 --> 01:46:23,718
<i>I'm sorry to say</i>

1791
01:46:23,794 --> 01:46:25,467
<i>a lot of actual blood
has been spilled...</i>

1792
01:46:25,588 --> 01:46:27,886
<i>as opposed to this
hypothetical blood.</i>

1793
01:46:27,965 --> 01:46:30,559
<i>This is
all speculative harm...</i>

1794
01:46:31,427 --> 01:46:34,647
<i>and what's not being talked
about is the actual harm...</i>

1795
01:46:34,805 --> 01:46:37,649
<i>and that's what has been
exposed through this leak.</i>

1796
01:46:37,808 --> 01:46:39,902
<i>So, I think that's important
for us to think about.</i>

1797
01:46:39,977 --> 01:46:41,103
At least he kept part
of the bargain.

1798
01:46:42,146 --> 01:46:45,070
250,000 diplomatic cables,
right here.

1799
01:46:45,149 --> 01:46:46,446
Amazing.

1800
01:46:46,942 --> 01:46:48,819
So, the bugger came through.

1801
01:46:51,989 --> 01:46:54,083
Nick was right. It's huge.

1802
01:46:54,158 --> 01:46:56,832
It's a window into every
government on the planet.

1803
01:46:57,453 --> 01:46:58,830
Already I've got
a dozen page ones.

1804
01:46:58,913 --> 01:47:00,335
Gaddafi lying to his people,

1805
01:47:00,414 --> 01:47:02,337
Putin arming
Georgian separatists.

1806
01:47:02,917 --> 01:47:06,672
Damning assessments of leaders
in Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia.

1807
01:47:07,171 --> 01:47:09,515
Are you still focused
on yesterday's news?

1808
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:12,934
On the high priest
of truth bragging

1809
01:47:13,010 --> 01:47:15,104
about a redaction process
that didn't exist?

1810
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:17,181
I wouldn't call that
yesterday's news.

1811
01:47:17,431 --> 01:47:18,774
Sorry, wasn't he your messiah?

1812
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:20,442
Yes. Yes.

1813
01:47:20,601 --> 01:47:22,774
Just like the rest of them.
Feet of clay.

1814
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:24,605
So he's a liar,
a callous little zealot,

1815
01:47:24,688 --> 01:47:26,531
just like every
other oddball source.

1816
01:47:26,607 --> 01:47:27,779
Mmm.

1817
01:47:28,484 --> 01:47:29,952
Seventeen little keystrokes,

1818
01:47:30,027 --> 01:47:32,371
and anyone in the world
can read what he publishes.

1819
01:47:32,488 --> 01:47:35,537
And now we've given him
a bloody megaphone, they will.

1820
01:47:36,325 --> 01:47:37,622
He's not a source.

1821
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:39,874
He's the head
of a huge media empire

1822
01:47:39,954 --> 01:47:42,048
that's accountable to no one.

1823
01:47:43,332 --> 01:47:45,209
And we put him there.

1824
01:48:32,631 --> 01:48:34,053
What is the purpose
of your trip?

1825
01:48:36,093 --> 01:48:38,016
He ¡s a guest lecturer
at University of Cairo.

1826
01:48:50,024 --> 01:48:51,446
What are you lecturing about?

1827
01:48:52,067 --> 01:48:53,444
Petroleum geology.

1828
01:49:13,047 --> 01:49:14,924
<i>We've crossed the border.</i>

1829
01:49:18,927 --> 01:49:20,395
Can you put them on?

1830
01:49:25,476 --> 01:49:26,477
Sarah?

1831
01:49:30,898 --> 01:49:32,650
You're safe.

1832
01:49:34,443 --> 01:49:35,820
What do we do now?

1833
01:49:37,946 --> 01:49:39,493
Where do we go?

1834
01:49:42,493 --> 01:49:45,167
<i>We have tried hard
to make sure...</i>

1835
01:49:45,329 --> 01:49:47,752
that this
material does not bring

1836
01:49:47,831 --> 01:49:49,253
innocents to harm.

1837
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:52,837
We're familiar with groups
whose abuses we exposed...

1838
01:49:53,462 --> 01:49:55,180
- Did you reach him?
- No.

1839
01:49:55,255 --> 01:49:56,427
If we both plug in,

1840
01:49:56,507 --> 01:49:58,760
we should be able to do it
while he's speaking.

1841
01:50:01,637 --> 01:50:03,435
<i>We have a harm
minimization process.</i>

1842
01:50:03,514 --> 01:50:05,608
<i>We don't do things
in an ad hoc way.</i>

1843
01:50:05,682 --> 01:50:07,935
<i>All the material is over
seven months old...</i>

1844
01:50:08,018 --> 01:50:11,318
Daniel, we both know he's
never going to step aside.

1845
01:50:11,855 --> 01:50:14,278
He can't be trusted.
We need to shut him down.

1846
01:50:14,483 --> 01:50:17,202
If you want to do this,
we have to do it now.

1847
01:51:23,927 --> 01:51:25,929
<i>...whose
abuses we exposed...</i>

1848
01:51:26,013 --> 01:51:29,483
<i>is attempting to criticize
the messenger, to detract...</i>

1849
01:51:44,072 --> 01:51:45,915
<i>It takes two things
to change the world...</i>

1850
01:51:45,991 --> 01:51:48,494
<i>and you'd be surprised how
many people have good ideas.</i>

1851
01:51:48,577 --> 01:51:49,703
<i>But...</i>

1852
01:51:50,162 --> 01:51:53,416
<i>commitment, true commitment...</i>

1853
01:51:53,749 --> 01:51:55,547
<i>it requires sacrifice.</i>

1854
01:51:56,585 --> 01:51:59,213
Good journalism
exposes powerful abusers...

1855
01:51:59,296 --> 01:52:02,140
so that often leads
to backlashes, but...

1856
01:52:12,935 --> 01:52:15,154
revolution is...

1857
01:52:17,314 --> 01:52:18,941
the struggle
between the past...

1858
01:52:19,816 --> 01:52:21,159
and the future.

1859
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:26,824
And the future has just begun.

1860
01:52:42,339 --> 01:52:44,307
I guess that
Turkmenistan comment

1861
01:52:44,383 --> 01:52:46,181
didn't go over too well
with the Secretary, did it?

1862
01:52:46,301 --> 01:52:49,145
Actually,
Berdymukhammedov himself

1863
01:52:49,221 --> 01:52:50,894
called for my early retirement.

1864
01:52:51,848 --> 01:52:53,225
I'm sure he called for
a lot more than that.

1865
01:52:53,392 --> 01:52:54,564
But there's diplomacy for you.

1866
01:52:55,394 --> 01:52:59,024
Well, let's drink to diplomacy.

1867
01:53:00,649 --> 01:53:02,617
At least while we still can.

1868
01:53:02,693 --> 01:53:03,990
Okay.

1869
01:53:16,039 --> 01:53:18,918
You know, I was...
I was watching him

1870
01:53:19,042 --> 01:53:21,420
give an interview
while I was packing up.

1871
01:53:22,879 --> 01:53:25,098
He was talking
about all the leaks

1872
01:53:25,215 --> 01:53:27,889
he'd put out in the last
six months alone...

1873
01:53:28,093 --> 01:53:30,095
and I started thinking.

1874
01:53:31,054 --> 01:53:34,524
Two advanced degrees,
a Fulbright.

1875
01:53:34,891 --> 01:53:38,896
Five diplomatic posts,
14 years abroad.

1876
01:53:40,564 --> 01:53:42,658
All those nights,
I stayed up worrying...

1877
01:53:42,733 --> 01:53:44,576
if the slightest turn of phrase

1878
01:53:44,693 --> 01:53:46,946
would send the whole world
to hell in a hand basket.

1879
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:49,789
And right now,
at this very moment...

1880
01:53:49,906 --> 01:53:51,158
I don't know which one of us

1881
01:53:51,241 --> 01:53:53,414
history is gonna judge
more harshly.

1882
01:54:08,091 --> 01:54:10,139
Julian!

1883
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:11,261
Contact us online,

1884
01:54:11,386 --> 01:54:13,013
I'll have my press person
get back to you.

1885
01:54:13,096 --> 01:54:14,473
Thank you.

1886
01:54:19,603 --> 01:54:21,276
That was amazing. Genius.

1887
01:54:21,396 --> 01:54:23,649
Have you seen <i>Time?
Forbes?</i>

1888
01:54:23,774 --> 01:54:24,741
We've got interview requests

1889
01:54:24,816 --> 01:54:25,908
- from Larry King, BSkyB...
- Julian.

1890
01:54:25,984 --> 01:54:26,985
Julian!

1891
01:54:34,826 --> 01:54:35,952
What is it?

1892
01:54:36,161 --> 01:54:38,960
There's something wrong
with the submission platform.

1893
01:55:10,487 --> 01:55:12,160
It's disabled.

1894
01:55:18,537 --> 01:55:19,914
Completely.

1895
01:55:23,166 --> 01:55:26,420
No one will be able to submit.

1896
01:56:18,555 --> 01:56:20,728
<i>You know, he dyes his hair.</i>

1897
01:56:24,227 --> 01:56:25,695
<i>I saw it once.</i>

1898
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:26,771
<i>We were at a conference,</i>

1899
01:56:26,897 --> 01:56:28,945
<i>and he went up
to the hotel room.</i>

1900
01:56:31,234 --> 01:56:34,078
<i>The cult he was in,
The Family...</i>

1901
01:56:37,115 --> 01:56:39,914
<i>they made the kids
dye their hair white.</i>

1902
01:56:52,297 --> 01:56:54,425
<i>I guess everyone has secrets.</i>

1903
01:56:55,592 --> 01:56:56,935
<i>Scars.</i>

1904
01:56:59,095 --> 01:57:01,473
<i>Moments in time
that shape them.</i>

1905
01:57:03,975 --> 01:57:05,852
<i>Some we can get past.</i>

1906
01:57:10,357 --> 01:57:11,950
Some we can't.

1907
01:57:13,527 --> 01:57:16,451
There was a moment
when everything was possible.

1908
01:57:18,448 --> 01:57:20,291
We changed the world.

1909
01:57:21,993 --> 01:57:23,461
He changed the world.

1910
01:57:25,038 --> 01:57:27,461
But then he made it
all about him.

1911
01:57:30,293 --> 01:57:32,136
It always was.

1912
01:57:33,630 --> 01:57:36,884
<i>Only someone so obsessed
with his own secrets...</i>

1913
01:57:37,217 --> 01:57:39,470
could have come up with a way
to reveal everyone else's.

1914
01:57:44,349 --> 01:57:46,727
You know, there was a time
when British papers...

1915
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:49,313
couldn't report
on parliamentary debate.

1916
01:57:50,689 --> 01:57:53,784
But then a few
very brave men...

1917
01:57:53,942 --> 01:57:58,163
started printing pamphlets
and leaking these debates.

1918
01:57:59,656 --> 01:58:02,626
And, uh, well,
I believe the men were hanged.

1919
01:58:04,119 --> 01:58:06,497
But the public
saw these pamphlets,

1920
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:08,048
and demanded access...

1921
01:58:08,123 --> 01:58:10,797
and the modern
fourth estate was born...

1922
01:58:11,585 --> 01:58:13,963
from the passion
and the vision...

1923
01:58:15,255 --> 01:58:17,758
of these few brave souls.

1924
01:58:18,925 --> 01:58:20,142
Who were hanged.

1925
01:58:20,468 --> 01:58:21,970
Who were hanged.

1926
01:58:25,974 --> 01:58:28,773
And now, we find ourselves
in the same position.

1927
01:58:28,852 --> 01:58:32,106
A new information revolution...

1928
01:58:32,397 --> 01:58:34,570
infinitely more powerful
than the last.

1929
01:58:34,899 --> 01:58:36,492
A fifth estate...

1930
01:58:36,568 --> 01:58:39,947
seemingly hell-bent on
destroying its predecessors.

1931
01:58:40,363 --> 01:58:42,206
All the old models,
dying faster

1932
01:58:42,282 --> 01:58:43,875
than the new can replace them.

1933
01:58:43,950 --> 01:58:47,170
Which is why we need
more brave souls.

1934
01:58:47,621 --> 01:58:51,626
You and Julian
have charted a course

1935
01:58:51,708 --> 01:58:53,460
through all this chaos...

1936
01:58:53,668 --> 01:58:55,011
pointed at the truth.

1937
01:58:55,378 --> 01:58:56,504
And yes...

1938
01:58:56,588 --> 01:58:59,467
the tyrants of this world
should beware.

1939
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:07,353
<i>Knowing that now,
we have the power</i>

1940
01:59:07,641 --> 01:59:10,895
<i>to demand the information
that one day soon...</i>

1941
01:59:10,977 --> 01:59:13,526
will wash them all away.

1942
01:59:17,484 --> 01:59:18,861
How's that?

1943
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:24,282
So, where should we start?

1944
01:59:26,826 --> 01:59:30,330
Well, most good stories
start at the beginning.

1945
02:00:19,921 --> 02:00:22,094
Free Julian Assange!

1946
02:00:22,549 --> 02:00:24,347
Free Julian Assange!

1947
02:00:25,051 --> 02:00:26,724
<i>There is no proof...</i>

1948
02:00:27,053 --> 02:00:30,057
that anyone came to any harm

1949
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:31,983
as a result
of the full disclosure...

1950
02:00:32,058 --> 02:00:33,526
of the unredacted documents

1951
02:00:33,643 --> 02:00:35,316
published on
the WikiLeaks website.

1952
02:00:35,395 --> 02:00:38,023
Not one shred of evidence.

1953
02:00:38,690 --> 02:00:42,661
We're taking on large,
powerful groups...

1954
02:00:42,736 --> 02:00:45,114
with vast and powerful lobbies
to protect them.

1955
02:00:45,196 --> 02:00:46,618
So, of course,
we're going to be attacked

1956
02:00:46,698 --> 02:00:48,041
in all sorts of manners.

1957
02:00:57,834 --> 02:00:59,177
My goodness.

1958
02:00:59,419 --> 02:01:02,218
Well, I know the mainstream
media is biased...

1959
02:01:02,338 --> 02:01:04,340
but this is absurd.

1960
02:01:04,424 --> 02:01:08,054
These allegations
are without basis...

1961
02:01:08,511 --> 02:01:11,264
and their issue
is deeply disturbing.

1962
02:01:19,355 --> 02:01:20,948
As an organization, of course

1963
02:01:21,024 --> 02:01:24,369
of course we, uh,
have made mistakes.

1964
02:01:24,569 --> 02:01:25,786
Um...

1965
02:01:26,905 --> 02:01:29,454
Uh... There are perhaps
a number of individuals...

1966
02:01:29,532 --> 02:01:31,876
An individual, perhaps,

1967
02:01:32,285 --> 02:01:34,788
that we should not
have employed.

1968
02:01:35,872 --> 02:01:36,964
Um...

1969
02:01:38,041 --> 02:01:41,295
That is possibly
the greatest mistake.

1970
02:01:49,928 --> 02:01:51,555
A WikiLeaks movie?

1971
02:01:52,722 --> 02:01:54,099
Which one?

1972
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:57,318
Oh, that one. Mmm.

1973
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:01,360
Well, that one is based on
the two worst books...

1974
02:02:01,439 --> 02:02:04,909
full of lies and distortion,
like all bad propaganda.

1975
02:02:04,984 --> 02:02:07,328
Look, urn...
A WikiLeaks movie...

1976
02:02:07,403 --> 02:02:09,997
It's more like
the "anti-WikiLeaks" movie.

1977
02:02:11,407 --> 02:02:14,331
If you want to know
the truth...

1978
02:02:14,619 --> 02:02:16,997
no one is going
to tell you the truth.

1979
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:19,503
They're only going
to tell you their version.

1980
02:02:19,916 --> 02:02:22,135
So, if you want the truth...

1981
02:02:22,919 --> 02:02:24,887
you have to seek it out
for yourself.

1982
02:02:24,963 --> 02:02:28,763
In fact, that's where
the real power lies...

1983
02:02:28,842 --> 02:02:33,598
in your willingness
to look beyond this story...

1984
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:35,273
any story.

1985
02:02:36,140 --> 02:02:37,642
And as long
as you keep searching,

1986
02:02:37,767 --> 02:02:39,986
you are dangerous to them.

1987
02:02:41,479 --> 02:02:43,982
That's what
they're afraid of. You.

1988
02:02:45,024 --> 02:02:46,822
It's all about you.

1989
02:02:51,865 --> 02:02:54,163
And a little bit about me, too.
