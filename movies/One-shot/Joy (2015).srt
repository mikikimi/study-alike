1
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,680
It doesn't make sense.

2
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,479
I don't understand how something
like this happened.

3
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,913
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

4
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,920
This has been my whole life,
and now it's gone.

5
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,837
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,992
Pendleton Industries is
all I've ever known.

7
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,509
And now it's all been taken away.

8
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,598
When someone sees a weakness in me,
i turn that weakness into a strength.

9
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,276
Danica, you're so strong.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,798
I don't think I could do
anything like this.

11
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,671
You can imagine changing your life...

12
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,308
by fighting for the deed
to the land, Clarinda.

13
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,433
Which is only possible if Bartholomew
is no longer living.

14
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,679
You will never get
the deed to the land again.

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,751
I will never allow it.

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,275
Put down that gun,
you silly girl.

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,155
Watch your step, Bartholomew.

18
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,998
Ridge is on his way.

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,156
And he's still in love with Clarinda.

20
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,190
And Jared loves me.

21
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,949
Clarinda...

22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,953
it's true.

23
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,189
I'm here for you.

24
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,598
This is the story of Joy,
as told by me, her grandmother.

25
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,713
Everybody starts out with some kind
of dream of what life will be.

26
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,350
Joy's dream started at this metal garage
her father ran.

27
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,755
Jackie, Jackie, bo - Backie
Banana - Fana, fo - Fackie

28
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,717
Fee - Fi, mo - Mackie
Jackie

29
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,395
My granddaughter had a best friend,
jackie.

30
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,556
Joy, Joy, bo - Boy
Banana - Fana, fo - Foy

31
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,439
While shivering in my shoes

32
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,551
I strike a careless pose

33
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,557
A half - Sister, Peggy.

34
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,720
A dog.

35
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,751
It's okay. It's okay, Mitzy.

36
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,439
A father.

37
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,637
A mother...

38
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,712
who is my daughter.

39
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,078
A grandmother. That's me.

40
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,071
She made many beautiful things
in her room.

41
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,474
Magic.

42
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,194
Some people love to make things.

43
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,036
They have the patience and the focus
to figure it out with their hands.

44
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,079
Joy was one of those people
who rejoiced in making things.

45
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,233
And I open the gate
to the big g reen meadow.

46
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,354
And I went into the forest.

47
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,270
And there, I conquered many dangers.

48
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
A wolf...

49
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,390
and other scary things.

50
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,637
And then I started to build
my very own house...

51
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,435
where I would live...

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,751
and make wonderful creations
for all the world...

53
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,717
to see and have.

54
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,759
And maybe for the prince and princess...

55
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,514
who lived across the forest,
in the castle.

56
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
See?

57
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,112
And they were in love.

58
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,759
And maybe they'd invite me over...

59
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,797
because of the things that I made.

60
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,635
You need a handsome prince.
That's what you need. A prince.

61
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,511
No, I don't need a prince.

62
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,797
This is a special power.
I don't need a prince.

63
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,474
My daughter Terry is separated,
and alone in her room...

64
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,352
watching soap operas.

65
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,709
You can imagine changing your life...

66
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,792
by fighting for the deed
to the land, Clarinda.

67
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,870
I have something for you.

68
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,559
Oh, Danica...

69
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,635
You're so strong.

70
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,234
I don't think I could ever do
something like this.

71
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,631
I always felt it was for me
to encourage her.

72
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,273
So I said...

73
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,749
You are goi ng to g row up and be a strong,
smart young woman...

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,358
go to school, meet a fine young man,
have beautiful children of your own...

75
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,958
and you're gonna build wonderful things
that you do in your room.

76
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Okay?

77
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,588
What happened to this girl's dreams?

78
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,069
Watch this.

79
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,231
Mother, I can't find my lanyard for work.

80
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,510
They're not gonna let me through
airport security without it.

81
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,234
Joy, you can't find your lanyard?
Can I help you?

82
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
No, but I...

83
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,435
Honey, listen.

84
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,798
I know life hasn't gone as we discussed
many times, sweetheart.

85
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,599
And you don't exactly have
your whole life ahead of you...

86
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,513
but you still have a good portion
of it, anyway.

87
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,431
Hope springs eternal.

88
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,198
- Thanks, Mimi.
- Sure.

89
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,954
Mother, look what I did find.

90
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,793
What is that?

91
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,837
How can you ask what this is?

92
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,908
The dog collar I invented
in high school.

93
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,037
Remember Mitzy choked a couple of times?

94
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,589
So I invented a dog collar
with a quick release...

95
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,829
so that a dog would never choke...

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,595
and I covered it with reflective tape,
plus it's a flea collar.

97
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,479
I probably wouldn't be late to this job
I'm going to...

98
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,240
if you'd gotten me a patent or a lawyer.

99
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,312
Joy the doer, Joy the doer.
You were always doing things, honey.

100
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,635
How could I be expected
to remember everything?

101
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,519
Now the Hartz company
has the patent to that collar.

102
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,591
I don't know how to get a patent.

103
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,833
What is that smell?

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,956
How did you get
yogurt down here, Mother?

105
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,640
I was wondering what that odor was.

106
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,831
It's starting to mold for Pete's sake.

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,073
Yes, I am, because I feel like I cannot
have the life bled out of me this way.

108
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,073
Joy, look who's back.
Look who's back!

109
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,629
Yes, Bartholomew is back.

110
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,630
No, no.

111
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,960
I thought Bartholomew was dead?

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And I'm a ghost.

113
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,080
He came back as a ghost with
even greater powers.

114
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,235
Ghost, you go away!

115
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,351
My powers are even greater now.

116
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,476
I cannot handle this.
How is this possible?

117
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,075
Stay away from him.

118
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,992
Clarinda, you don't know
what a ghost can do to you!

119
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,633
Even from beyond the grave.

120
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,238
Grandma's gonna take you
to the birthday party, okay?

121
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Five minutes.

122
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,394
Hi. What are you doing here?

123
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,750
I'm returning him to you.
I don't want him anymore.

124
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,955
What?

125
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,669
He's damaged.

126
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,313
He has no place else to go.

127
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,551
He's been living
in my house for two years.

128
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,671
Dad, I'm so sorry.

129
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,274
But you know,
tony's living in the basement.

130
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,520
Your ex - Husband shouldn't be living
in your basement.

131
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,392
That's not the proper way to be divorced.

132
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,677
Okay. I don't know
where I'm gonna put you.

133
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,598
Dad, don't go in there. Mom's in there.

134
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,274
You can have him back, Terry.
I don't want him anymore.

135
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,032
What was so much better about
being with Sharon, Rudy?

136
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,355
Dad, don't answer that.

137
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,476
We went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

138
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,068
- What did you like at the museum?
- What did I like? I'll tell you what I like.

139
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,074
I like the ancient Roman statues.
I like the medieval armor.

140
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,912
I like the Etruscan jewelry.

141
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,720
- Museums are full of dust and death.
- I like going to the café...

142
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,000
having an espresso, a nice panini,
that's what I like.

143
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,110
You had a panini in a coffin, Rudy.

144
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,198
- A dusty, boring coffin. Yuck.
- Then why'd you ask me?

145
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,520
What are you, a crazy person?

146
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,198
It's like having a conversation
with an insane asylum person.

147
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,713
What else, Captain Jack?
What else was so great?

148
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,438
Captain Jack, you're calling me. Okay.

149
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,749
Yes, you're Captain Jack,
the flying jackass.

150
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,797
Yeah, and you know what you are?
You're like a gas leak.

151
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,598
- We don't smell you, we don't see you...
- I am not a gas leak!

152
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,233
- But you're killing us all silently.
- You take that back...

153
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,515
and tell me what else you did
with Sharon!

154
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,000
You creature from the Black Lagoon.

155
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,559
No! This conversation is over.

156
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,597
- I'm leaving. Good luck.
- Oh, my God. Here it goes.

157
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,551
Watch out, Joy. He's gonna snap!

158
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,790
Please. You want me to snap.
That's your whole routine. You...

159
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Guard the china!

160
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,116
- Hey, Terry, you like this?
- Dad, no!

161
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,833
How's this for snapping?

162
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,588
- No! No.
- How's this?

163
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,275
This is snapping!

164
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,749
- Dad! Stop!
- He's disturbed, Joy!

165
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,234
He's a disturbed man!

166
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,192
- I'm disturbed?
- He's a damaged man!

167
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,998
You're right, I am disturbed.

168
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,633
You're the great disturber!

169
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,595
I'm sorry, honey.

170
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,795
I don't like this.

171
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,552
You're not supposed to see
this kind of thing.

172
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,950
I'm very, very sorry.
I apologize sincerely.

173
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,113
It's not gonna happen, okay?
We have other...

174
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,920
I'm gonna clean all this up.

175
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,632
Dad, no. Don't clean it up.

176
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,791
Dad, stop. Just don't, okay?

177
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,792
Stop. I'll do it.
I just want to get you out of this room.

178
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,915
Thank you.

179
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,760
Hi, guys.
I'm sorry about all the yelling.

180
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,876
Mimi's gonna take you
to the birthday party, okay?

181
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,513
Hi, my sweethearts.

182
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,671
- You broke things again.
- He did break stuff.

183
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,478
I did break some things,
but Grandma was wrong.

184
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,870
So I was a little wrong,
but she was really wrong.

185
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,150
But Grandpa's gonna come stay with us
for a little while.

186
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,633
Yay!

187
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,559
A sleepover with Grandpa! Yay!

188
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,230
Sharon never separated the wash.
The whites were always gray.

189
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,709
But you have that magic touch, sweetheart,
so could I give this to you, please?

190
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,717
Yeah, I'll take care of it, yeah.
Just get your bag.

191
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,438
What about my ledgers and all that stuff?
My accounting books?

192
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,709
I got them.
I'll get them to you later today.

193
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,399
- I love you, Grandpa.
- Love you.

194
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,920
- I did your taxes, I did your W - 2s.
- Okay. Very important.

195
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,194
You suck!

196
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,755
What is he doing here?

197
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,029
Sharon brought him back...

198
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,193
so he's gonna stay with us until he finds
a new love or a new place to live.

199
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,588
You know how this goes.

200
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,155
Dad, up.

201
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,836
This is not the proper way to be divorced,
the two of you.

202
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,600
You're gonna tell me how to be divorced?

203
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,029
I'm a provider, Tom Jones.
I have my own business.

204
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,719
I help Joy with the mortgage.
What do you do?

205
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,030
You sing all night
at Angela Starpoli's club.

206
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,316
You get repeatedly fired
from Campbell's Soup.

207
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,396
Okay, well I'm gonna divide
the basement.

208
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,320
I'm divorced.
I can do whatever I want, Rudy.

209
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,833
This is not the proper way to be divorced.

210
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,598
And I'm about to be late for work.

211
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,360
So please try not to fight
in front of the children, okay?

212
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,560
Especially not physically.

213
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,234
Rudy, you see this?
This microphone here?

214
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,474
You touch it, and I kill you.

215
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,909
Okay. I'm leaving.

216
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,070
Please try not to kill each other
while I'm gone.

217
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,310
You've gone mad. This is all your fault!

218
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,232
Clarinda. Clarinda! Don't.

219
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,193
Clarinda, something terrible happened!
Stay away from him!

220
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,679
Oh, my God.
I thought I fixed this thing.

221
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,751
N ice job, Joy. N ice job.

222
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,878
Peggy? What are you doing here?

223
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,521
What's the matter with you?
Sending Grandma Mimi with her arthritis...

224
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,198
to take them to their friend's birthday?

225
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,509
I'm fine.

226
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,797
They have a much better time
with me anyway, with Aunt Peggy.

227
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,076
But I wasn't stupid enough to get into
a bad marriage and have a couple of kids.

228
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,520
Don't bother your sister, Peggy.

229
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,994
I'm gonna talk to Dad about business.
All right?

230
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,792
You gonna come bring the books
by the garage later?

231
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,439
Yeah, I'm gonna bring them later.
He's in the basement.

232
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
I'm joking with you.

233
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,915
Yeah. I know.

234
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,230
Kids, we're gonna do
something fun later, okay?

235
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,078
We're doing something fun now.

236
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,154
Oh, we found your luggage
but it's in Cleveland.

237
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,912
So now we just need to get it back
to New York City.

238
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,235
I'm filing a complaint.

239
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,232
My husband needs his medication.

240
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,192
What's your name? Joy?

241
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,152
You don't seem joyous to me today.

242
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,117
Perhaps I am not so joyous today.

243
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,032
- Joy, I think you're getting demoted.
- Hi, how you doing?

244
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,077
Listen, I need you to speak
to the supervisor.

245
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,869
We're gonna be having some changes,
and you're gonna be going to the night hours.

246
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,797
- Night hours? Tom, I can't work night hours.
- And we're having cutbacks.

247
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,440
- I've got two kids.
- Joy, I'm sorry.

248
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,669
Good luck.

249
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,795
Bye, Susan.

250
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,629
I'm not paying for metal
that I haven't gotten.

251
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,677
On top of me send...
You know, he wants to get paid.

252
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,957
He doesn't send an invoice,
and he hasn't even sent the metal.

253
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,032
But why doesn't he just send the invoice?
Send the invoice, I'll pay him.

254
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,598
Yep. That's it. Send the invoice.

255
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,159
Hi. Dad, I want to thank you again
for helping with the mortgage.

256
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,240
Yeah.

257
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,232
I settled the accounts, balanced the books.

258
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Thank you.

259
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,952
I'm sorry business is so bad, Dad.

260
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,554
I don't think that
that crazy gun range is helping.

261
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,519
How is that still legal?

262
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,398
- What can I do?
- After all these years?

263
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,272
They keep to themselves.

264
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,320
It's their property.
The police leave them alone.

265
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,198
Why? You think it's costing us business?

266
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,679
I don't think it's helping.

267
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,069
Well, If you wanna help, why don't you
come here and manage this place?

268
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,879
You know, I'd like to go the next level.
Put on a nice suit.

269
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,036
You know, go out there
and get some accounts.

270
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,872
Yeah, this is 9873.
Just checking my mailbox.

271
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
What is that?

272
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,600
Yeah, I have a pen. What is it?

273
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,149
13 - 14. That's it?

274
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,549
Thank you.

275
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,079
What was that?

276
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,350
It's a 900 number.

277
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,828
What's a 900 number?

278
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,075
It's, you know, a dating service
for widows and widowers.

279
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,434
Dating service?

280
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,880
You're not a widow or a widower.

281
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,360
What's the difference? I'm single.

282
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,273
I meet nice ladies.
Maybe we fall in love.

283
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,874
I have to fall in love or I'm not interested.
You know me.

284
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
I know, Dad.

285
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,873
Sharon was no good for him.
It's nice for him to meet somebody new.

286
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,160
- I got him some new clothes, you know?
- Okay. Okay.

287
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,673
- Hello? Is this 7633?
- It's good., THEN JOY TO PEGGY

288
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,796
- Okay. I love you. See you later.
- Yes?

289
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
Bye.

290
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,678
Hi. This is 9833.

291
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,272
Hi! Hi, how are you?

292
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,873
What a nice voice you have.

293
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,435
Thank you.

294
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,630
- Oh, an accent.
- Yes.

295
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,028
I am from Italy.

296
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,792
Oh! Continental.

297
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,629
What is your name?

298
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,472
My name is Rudy, what's yours?

299
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
Trudy.

300
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,678
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

301
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
Your name is Trudy?

302
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,029
Yes!

303
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,473
Rudy and Trudy. I love it.

304
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,348
Let's figure out when we're gonna meet.

305
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,556
That's a good idea. Let's have dinner.

306
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,320
- I could come pick you up.
- Yeah.

307
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,713
I have a green Mercedes.

308
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,836
Okay, 6:30? I'll be ready.

309
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,149
Ciao.

310
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,633
Good luck with your date, Dad.

311
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,074
Thank you. I'm excited.

312
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,719
What do you think you're gonna wear?

313
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,350
Polo by Ralph Lauren.

314
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,360
Did you have to use
the whole bottle of cologne?

315
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Tony!

316
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,118
You smell like my grandmother.
He smells like my grandmother.

317
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,838
Hey, please. Don't make me tense.

318
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,032
Don't stress me out.
I gotta stay nice and loose.

319
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,832
- Now you're tense?
- I'm tense. You're making me tense.

320
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,230
- Guys, stop. Please.
- I'm making you tense?

321
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,915
My carriage awaits.

322
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,314
Have a great date.

323
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Wish me luck.

324
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,749
You don't need it.

325
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,311
Joy, water!

326
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
Where are my cufflinks?

327
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,392
Mommy, come read to me!

328
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
Five minutes, Cristy.

329
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,874
Mother, again?

330
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,469
Yeah, you just sit right there.
Are you comfortable?

331
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:42,153
How many times do I have to tell you
not to clean your brushes out in the sink!

332
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,675
Danica thinks it's unladylike
to toss things in the toilet.

333
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,029
And I happen to agree.

334
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,560
Yeah? Well, why don't you have
Danica do your plumbing then?

335
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,189
Danica can direct her power
anywhere Danica chooses.

336
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,834
That is the power of Danica.

337
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,754
Oh, my God.

338
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,155
If this problem gets any worse...

339
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,430
we're gonna have to move you
into a different room.

340
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,033
That means no TV.

341
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,438
That could be very scary for you.

342
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,318
Don't let that happen, Joy.
This is my comfort nest.

343
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,316
We're gonna need to get
a plumber in here.

344
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,549
What?

345
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,039
There's gonna... a man in my room?

346
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,395
Well, I don't know any female plumbers
other than me.

347
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,959
Well, can't you fix it, Joy?

348
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,549
This has surpassed my capabilities.

349
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,869
Thanks, Joy.

350
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,678
"The cicada is a large flying insect
two to three inches long.

351
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,395
"It makes a sound of up to 120 decibels,
louder than some telephones.

352
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,835
"It lives half of its life above ground
evading predators.

353
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,638
This is the book you wanted me
to read to you, Cristy?

354
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,360
How did this book even get in the house?

355
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,239
Aunt Peggy got it for me.

356
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,831
She said the reason I like cicadas
is because they fill the air with sound...

357
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,076
which makes the house less lonelier for me.

358
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,070
Aunt Peggy tells you how you feel
about the house being lonely?

359
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,759
Aunt Peggy tells me a lot of things.

360
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,319
Keep reading, please.

361
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,268
I don't want you
listening to Aunt Peggy too much.

362
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,793
Okay. Why?

363
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,469
"The cicada,
a symbol of rebirth in many countries...

364
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,315
"digs into the ground and stays buried
for up to 17 years."

365
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,032
That's such a random number.
Why 17 years?

366
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,955
It doesn't even say why.

367
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,112
I understand the four seasons in a year...

368
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,714
but why would something
stay hidden for 17 years?

369
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,599
That's just unsettling.
I'm not reading this.

370
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,791
You're sleepy anyway.
We gotta go to bed.

371
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,798
I wanna sleep with Nana.

372
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,473
No, you should sleep upstairs
in your room.

373
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,153
I want Nana.

374
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,920
All right. Well, watch out.
There's a hole here.

375
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,111
Just going to lay down for a second.

376
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,315
I feel like I'm in a prison.

377
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,074
No, Bartholomew's the ex - Con
in the story.

378
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,191
And Clarinda doesn't even know about it.

379
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,998
But Danica's onto him.

380
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,833
They all blame Clarinda
but Danica's gonna get to the bottom of it.

381
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,069
No. No.

382
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,674
Yes. It was you Clarinda.

383
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,160
I will get to the bottom of this.

384
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,838
You've made terrible mistakes.

385
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,439
It was Clarinda!

386
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,275
Oh.

387
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,675
Look who's here.

388
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,035
Look who's here.

389
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,357
We are here today
to remember what was lost...

390
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,829
seventeen years ago.

391
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,036
Do you remember?

392
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,634
Peggy comes with me.

393
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,836
Joy spends half the time with us.

394
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,039
We'll take her paper forest.

395
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,440
That's Joy's special thing,
and it belongs in this house.

396
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,629
No, I...

397
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
Joy.

398
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,949
Joy, wake up!

399
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,397
Someone's been ringing the doorbell.

400
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,634
Jackie!

401
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,115
Oh, thank God! It's you.

402
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,670
What happened? I'm worried about you.
I don't see you any more.

403
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,592
You don't come to the PTA.

404
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,959
You know how my mom's always clogging the
sink with her hair from the brushes?

405
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,428
With the pipes in her room?

406
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,397
Yeah. She did it again.

407
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,515
Again?

408
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,750
Yes, and I had to
bash open a hole in the floor.

409
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,719
There's a huge hole in the floor
of my mother's room and I'm broke.

410
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,989
My father works hard.
He's had some bad breaks.

411
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,870
I hope he gets another girlfriend,
and he'll move out of the basement.

412
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,679
He's in the basement with Tony?

413
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,553
Yes. And they hate each other.

414
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,513
Yes.

415
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,840
It's a disaster.
They won't stop fighting.

416
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
I don't know.

417
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,512
But how are you?
How's the family? How is everybody?

418
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,715
Everybody's okay.

419
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,994
How's work?

420
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,949
My job, I could take it or leave it.

421
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,995
What happened to us, Jackie?

422
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,628
All the things
that we used to dream about.

423
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,758
I feel like they just keep getting
farther and farther away.

424
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,912
Remember the night of the party
where everything started?

425
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,832
The band was playing.

426
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,918
Everything was so exciting.

427
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,398
Joy, you came!

428
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,080
I'm so glad you came!
This is my boyfriend, Andre.

429
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,520
- Hi, Andre.
- Nice to meet you.

430
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,352
Andre, this is my childhood friend, Joy.

431
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,995
Come inside!

432
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,513
- Wow.
- Check my music class, accountant girl.

433
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,795
This is a class?

434
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,915
Yes!

435
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,798
Don't turn on the lights
'cause I don't wanna see

436
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,275
Mama told me not to come

437
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,360
- They're so good!
- They are! The teacher's band.

438
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,358
Mama told me not to come

439
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,036
She said,
"that ain 't the way to have fun, son"

440
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,952
"That ain 't the way to have fun"

441
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,349
Mama told me not to come

442
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,229
Mama told me not to come

443
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,269
- Who's the bald guy?
- That's our music teacher.

444
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,476
And he has all this...
This is his house?

445
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,999
- Yeah, this is his house.
- Wow.

446
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,388
He's from Venezuela.

447
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,114
- Who is that guy?
- Yeah.

448
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,390
That's the music teacher's son.

449
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,598
Oh, my gosh.

450
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,199
You're dancing. Here you go.

451
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,315
What am I doing now?

452
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,555
- You're dancing.
- No.

453
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,119
- Let me show you my father's house.
- What?

454
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,395
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

455
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,118
I'm gonna be a singer.

456
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,395
Really?

457
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,074
Yeah. I'm gonna be
the next Tom Jones.

458
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,391
That's a big ambition.
There's only one Tom Jones.

459
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,075
I know, but you can't let the practical
get you down.

460
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,150
You gotta keep going to what you love.

461
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,069
That's true.

462
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,878
That's what my father taught me.

463
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,599
What about you?

464
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:26,829
I invented a dog collar that I want to get
patented, but I don't think it ever will.

465
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,637
I was valedictorian in high school.

466
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,232
I got into a college in Boston...

467
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,437
but I'm staying here
because my parents are getting divorced...

468
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,750
and I'm staying to help my mom.

469
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,748
And I help my dad with business stuff.
Accountant.

470
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,554
Maybe your dreams are on hold right now.

471
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,029
No?

472
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,790
That's a nice way of putting it.

473
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,877
This song is going to be
in the town musical.

474
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,632
We should sing it together.

475
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,429
I know I stand in line
Until you think you have the time

476
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,512
To spend an evening with me

477
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,789
That's really nice.

478
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,075
Okay, go.

479
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,474
- No.
- Okay.

480
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,790
And if we go someplace to dance

481
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,872
I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me

482
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,634
He gave my girl a spring in her step,
just when she needed it.

483
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,995
What are we doing? T ony.

484
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,630
He got her to do the musical,
something she never would have done.

485
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,274
I know I stand in line
Until you think you have the time

486
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,756
To spend an evening with me

487
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,628
And if we go someplace to dance
I know that there's a chance

488
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,110
You won't be leaving with me

489
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,031
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two

490
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:10,277
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying something stupid like "I love you"

491
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,273
I can see it in your eyes
That you despise the same old lies

492
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,716
You heard the night before

493
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,110
You're so smart, you're so beautiful,
i... i just...

494
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,389
You could have married anybody.

495
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,875
You could have married a doctor, a lawyer,
a nice man instead of this...

496
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,479
I don't even know what to call this guy.

497
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,520
Are you seriously talking
about this right now?

498
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,392
It's still not too late.

499
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,669
Dad.

500
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,713
Let's go.

501
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Think about it.

502
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
Dad!

503
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,912
We are a loving family, a solid family.

504
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,399
I've been married to my wife...

505
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,709
Now I have a speech.

506
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,359
He wasn't finished, Dad.

507
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,913
He's finished now.

508
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,231
I had two failed marriages.

509
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,599
The daughter from my
first marriage, Peggy...

510
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,911
has a lot of tension with the daughter
from my second marriage, Joy.

511
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,633
I was married to Joy's mother
for 18 miserable fucking years.

512
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,877
Dad! That's just mean! Sit down!

513
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,359
But I got out of all that.

514
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,638
And I finally met the light of my life,
sharon.

515
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,269
- To you, baby.
- Dad!

516
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,475
You're my guy.

517
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,669
I toast you.

518
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,113
Dad! Stop!

519
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,111
- Will you stop it?
- Rudolph, please! Enough.

520
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,113
- Are you happy now?
- Fairly happy, yes.

521
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,879
Look what I found.

522
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,149
The divorce glass.

523
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,795
Salud.

524
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,275
I give these kids 50 - 50 odds.

525
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,753
Salud, everybody. Have a good time.

526
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,838
Tony, wake up!

527
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,356
Please! Cristy hasn't eaten,
tommy needs to be changed.

528
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,072
Oh, Cristy. What are you doing?

529
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,635
- Get up. I just told your boss you're going to work!
- But what did you lie for?

530
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,876
- Because you're gonna lose another job!
- No, honey, I'm sick!

531
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,877
You're not sick, you're hungover!

532
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,350
That's not who I am!
I'm a singer, that's what I do!

533
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,960
You're not making any money singing!

534
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,920
Get in your car right now
and go get your job!

535
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,840
You're trying to turn me
into someone I'm not!

536
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,349
I can't do this!
I can't do this, Tony!

537
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,039
I am losing my mind!

538
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,316
I don't wanna end up like my family.

539
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,759
Time moves forward.

540
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,112
Time moves backwards.

541
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Time stands still.

542
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,511
Do I live up to my profile
or do I fall short?

543
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,877
Are you kidding?
You're a banana flambé with extra rum.

544
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,030
You're a trip to the moon
on gossamer wings.

545
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,351
Wow! You're so poetic and romantic.

546
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,440
It's true!

547
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,272
Just like my late Morris.

548
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,439
Morris. Now, he was American and you're Italian,
and your name originated how?

549
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,670
My name. My Italian name is Geltrude.

550
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Geltrude.

551
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,475
And then he called me "Trude,"
and then became more American. "Trudy."

552
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,955
Trudy.

553
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,556
Why don't you come with your entire family,
on my late Morris' boat?

554
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,071
Bring the children,
bring the grandchildren.

555
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,593
Like a motorboat?

556
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,432
No, no, It's a sailboat. 55 feet.

557
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,591
- Wow. That's big. That is big.
- Yeah. Yeah.

558
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,909
Yeah, I would love to.

559
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,036
We'd bring some nice food,
something to drink, that would be great.

560
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,109
Yeah, but not red wine,
because it might stain the teakwood deck.

561
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,395
It's very precious.

562
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,152
Okay, understood. No red wine.

563
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,238
I got the red wine!

564
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,431
No, no, no, I'm sorry,
you can't have red wine on the boat.

565
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,591
No red wine, Tony. No red wine.

566
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,352
Why? It's a beautiful wine!

567
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,670
What's Tom Jones doing here anyway?
Who invited him?

568
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,280
He's here to help me with the kids.

569
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,153
I brought Peggy to help.

570
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,912
Peggy says mean things
about me to my children, so...

571
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,400
I say nice things about you, too.

572
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
It's a beautiful wine.

573
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,795
You have an accent, too!

574
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,790
Yes.

575
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,154
Where are you from, paesano?

576
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,595
Paesano? Don't encourage him, please.

577
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,880
I'm from Venezuela, darling.

578
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,075
Do you know this song?

579
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,030
I can see why she still loves him!

580
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,434
Come on. Come on board.

581
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,398
- This is gonna be a disaster.
- Dad.

582
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
Cheers!

583
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,192
I dressed for boating but I didn't realize
how cold it was gonna be.

584
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,480
My late husband Morris, I met him in Milano
for a trade show for his swimwear line.

585
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,393
He used to say, "Sailing in the winter...

586
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,070
"is the best comparison
to life in the world of commerce."

587
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,195
Oh, no!

588
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,194
Morris' teakwood deck!

589
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,918
Yeah. Grand adventure. Great.

590
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,672
Nice work, Tom Jones.

591
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,468
Trudy, I know that it's upsetting,
but wouldn't Morris say, "What a grand adventure?"

592
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,757
Yeah, you're right. No big deal.
He's probably laughing up in heaven.

593
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,592
We should have used paper cups.

594
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,235
No, but it's not the same thing.

595
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,669
You need a nice glass
for a beautiful wine, you know?

596
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,400
Oh, boy.

597
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,598
Look. It's a piece of glass
right in her hand.

598
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,911
Are you all right, honey?

599
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,150
Yeah, she's thinking of something, Tony.

600
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,716
One loop. One continuous thing.

601
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,838
She's talking to herself. It's strange.

602
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,393
Honey, you should go to bed.

603
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,113
If it was all one continuous loop. Yeah.

604
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,433
Hi, I'm Touissant.

605
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,477
Touissant? Who's this guy?

606
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,429
It's not for me. Is it for you?

607
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,640
No, It's not for me, man.

608
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,915
The plumber.

609
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,229
What's he here for?

610
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,032
What do you think? Terry.

611
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,828
Terry. Oh, Terry.

612
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,391
Oh, no, wait. What's going on?
What is this man doing in my room?

613
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
This is...

614
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,712
- Touissant.
- Touissant.

615
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,999
Terry, Touissant.

616
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,153
Well, I mean, I've taped my show...

617
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,511
and then, well,
exactly how long is this going to take?

618
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,435
Well, It shouldn't take more than a day.

619
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,989
What accent is that, Joy?

620
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,559
What country is that from?

621
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,278
- Haiti.
- Haiti.

622
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,475
Haiti?

623
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,119
It's French and Creole.

624
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,519
French and Creole.

625
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,360
Well, Is there any way...
Could you please put a curtain up here...

626
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,680
so that I can come and go in my room
and watch my show while he's still working?

627
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,432
Of course. I have a stapler.

628
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,955
Thank you, sir.

629
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,638
You're welcome, mademoiselle.

630
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,915
Mademoiselle?

631
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,358
Good luck in here
and good luck with the... that.

632
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,633
Why don't you go to bed?

633
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,956
Keep going up the stairs.
Go to bed.

634
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,158
I don't want to go to sleep.
I don't want to have that horrible dream.

635
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,551
Come on! You can't have the same dream twice.
It never happens.

636
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,870
- It's impossible.
- That's not true.

637
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,395
I had the Peggy dream so many times
when I was younger...

638
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,834
with the masks and the robe.

639
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,433
It doesn't make sense. No, no.

640
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,949
You can't have the same dream twice.
Maybe it's the...

641
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,348
Rudy, she's thinking about something.

642
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,034
Maybe it's a good dream,
and she's working something out.

643
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,590
I don't wanna work anything out.
I just want a nice, dumb sleep.

644
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,194
Let's knock her out.
Give her a children's cough medicine.

645
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,760
- That's what does it.
- Is that safe?

646
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,034
No. It's not safe.

647
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,269
It's expired.

648
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,839
Go on, there. Knock it back, honey.

649
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,991
- No.
- Okay, one more. Knock it down. Come on.

650
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,758
- Rudy!
- Do it, Tony.

651
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,512
- I don't know.
- Just do it. One more.

652
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,640
Okay, one more.

653
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,040
Enough with this! That's it.
I'm gonna make her a hot toddy.

654
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,355
That's what she needs.

655
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,640
You're gonna intoxicate her.

656
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,439
It's all natural, It's all herbal.
Nothing strong.

657
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,869
I was kidnapped by another monk,
who was from Switzerland.

658
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:36,358
And it turned out that this monk
was a duke of a royal family.

659
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,796
I shouldn't say "was,"
because he still is.

660
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,673
Leave me alone.

661
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,760
I don't thi nk we should let her
sleep on the stairs.

662
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,554
Let's just put it here in the couch, okay?

663
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,676
Seventeen years.

664
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,479
Think about it. We've been hiding...

665
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,393
for seventeen years.

666
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,630
Seventeen years.

667
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,556
We used to make things.
Seventeen years ago.

668
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,395
Then, that all stopped.
What happened?

669
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,312
When you're hiding, you're safe...

670
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,479
because people can't see you.

671
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,752
But, funny thing about hiding...

672
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,549
you're even hidden from yourself.

673
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,598
Baby, what's the matter?

674
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,831
Tony, you need to move out
of the basement.

675
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,558
You need to get your own house.

676
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,193
What? Why?

677
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,268
Because I go out at night
and sing at Angela's club?

678
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,555
- Is that it?
- No.

679
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,035
Because we've been divorced
for two years.

680
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,713
We need to move on.

681
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,154
You need to move out.

682
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,712
Rudy, you need to move out, too.

683
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,800
What?

684
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,956
There's more room in the basement
for me now.

685
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,675
And another thing, Rudy.

686
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,069
Tomorrow, I would like to have a meeting
with you and Trudy at your office...

687
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,795
to discuss her investing
in the manufacturing of my new idea.

688
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,195
No.

689
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,240
I'm still getting to know her
and falling in love.

690
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,475
I can't do that. I won't do that.

691
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,355
And what manufacturing idea?
What are you talking about?

692
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,156
I have always been there for you,
no matter what.

693
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,794
I didn't go away to school.

694
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,800
I stayed to help you and Mom
through the divorce and do your accounting.

695
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,349
I let you live here whenever you want...

696
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,631
no matter what it is.

697
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,831
I am respectfully asking
for the favor that you owe me.

698
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,958
If you look into your heart,
you'll know that I'm right.

699
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:00,754
Cristy, I need to use your crayons,
your colored pencils and your paper.

700
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,999
Let's go to my room.

701
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,200
You're not gonna believe this.

702
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,396
So, you know that plumber
that you recommended?

703
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,595
Yeah, Touissant.

704
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,389
So I hire him, Terry freaks out,
completely disoriented.

705
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,074
Hasn't had a man in her room
for eight years, since Rudy.

706
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,912
Makes me hang a drop cloth.

707
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,080
The way I look at it...

708
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,556
is that this is an opportunity
for you to invest in a new business...

709
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,231
... that'll mean more money for you.

710
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,560
Tell Rico, Dad. Number five's gotta go off.

711
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,433
Rico, number five, no, off.

712
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,870
Go off! Thank you!

713
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,235
It's a standard handle, 53 inches.

714
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,431
The sleeve connects to the mop head.

715
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,750
Now, this is where it gets complicated.

716
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,152
There's a clip
that connects the sleeve to the...

717
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,274
I don't even know what to call it.
The "cup."

718
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,318
Which is connected to the mop head.

719
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,916
So, when you pull up on the sleeve,
the mop head stretches...

720
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,634
so you can wring it
without ever touching it with your hands.

721
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,192
The only thing we see
is this crayon drawings.

722
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,713
We can't make heads or tails.

723
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,719
We don't know what it is.

724
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,477
So, the mop doesn't hang loose, like hair?
Like a string?

725
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,790
It hangs, but not on loose,
open ends like hair.

726
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,598
It's one continuous loop.

727
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,829
- I don't get it.
- I don't get it.

728
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,400
- I don't get it. What's he doing here?
- What's he doing here?

729
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,477
He is the father of our children,
and my friend, and he looks out for me.

730
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,471
We're doing an invention.

731
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,995
Cheers.

732
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,669
Right.

733
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,591
Yes we are, Cristy.

734
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,152
It's very serious.

735
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,313
It's priority.

736
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,799
Yes it is.

737
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,796
And I'm helping.

738
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,558
Yes you are.

739
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,590
Ça se fait comme ça in Haiti.

740
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,995
Touissant is teaching me
how to speak French.

741
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,551
And the word for "industrious" is...

742
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,275
Yes.

743
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,152
At first I thought maybe
something scary would happen...

744
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,273
like what happened with Danica
while she was kidnapped by a man...

745
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,000
who turned out to be in hiding
from the royal family in Switzerland...

746
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,395
and then she moved to Switzerland.

747
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,750
Of course, she befriended that man
and more.

748
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,151
Don't ever try and limit me, Joy.

749
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,360
And let me know if you want some
of this Chakalaka.

750
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Chaka. Say "chaka."

751
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,430
Chaka.

752
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,520
It's very good.

753
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,152
Hey, Rocky. Hey, Tom!

754
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,199
Take her inside the office.

755
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,589
- Hey, Tino.
- Hey, Joy.

756
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,637
I wanted to show you something.

757
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,280
So, will you help me figure this out?

758
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,472
I know that it has to be welded.
This part is supposed to twist.

759
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,873
1... 2... 3...

760
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,072
4, 5, 6...

761
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,760
What are you doing?

762
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,756
38, 39, 40.

763
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,072
All right. All right, Dad,
come over here and grab this.

764
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,918
Grab it right in the middle.

765
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,515
Okay. There.

766
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,234
And go up, Jackie go down. You see it?

767
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,389
Not yet.

768
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,516
All right. Here.

769
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,793
- How about now?
- No.

770
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,832
Well you're going to.

771
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,195
I don't see it yet, I mean...

772
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,630
- You ready?
- Yeah.

773
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,314
300 feet of continuous cotton loops.

774
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,312
That's what I drew.

775
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,477
This is why I would like to ask you
for your investment, Trudy.

776
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,428
Morris worked 50 years
to earn his fortune, Joy.

777
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,877
Before he passed on to the next world,
he made me promise on his deathbed...

778
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,033
that I would never be neglectful
with one dollar of the money...

779
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,270
that he so carefully earned.

780
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,279
Therefore you have to answer Morris's
four questions of financial worthiness.

781
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,589
Are you ready?

782
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,073
I think so. Yes.

783
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,272
Question number one:

784
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,190
Where did you go to high school?

785
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,958
Plainfield Public High.

786
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:33,358
Question number two:
Who were you in high school?

787
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,559
I was valedictorian.

788
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,069
The smartest student in the school.

789
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,514
That's good, right?

790
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,589
Perhaps.

791
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,911
Joy might be a brilliant,
unrealized creator of commerce.

792
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,429
But on the other hand...

793
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,354
it's equally possible that she is
a fatally flawed underachiever...

794
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,674
doomed to a lifetime of failure,
disappointment, unfulfilled expectations.

795
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,318
You must admit, Joy...

796
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,557
that your life, to date,
makes a stronger case for...

797
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,879
... disappointment.

798
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,513
I don't care about any of this.

799
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,433
It's not only risky,
but it's fiscally irresponsible...

800
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,909
and doesn't make any sense, whatsoever.

801
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,439
Joy's never run a business in her life.

802
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,000
I've been running my father's garage
for the last 10 years.

803
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,232
Our father.

804
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,749
I have ventures that I'm planning
to launch here...

805
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,911
at this existing business.

806
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,389
You never mentioned any of this...

807
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,755
until I came to Trudy
to ask for an investment.

808
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,869
What's Morris's third question?

809
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,399
Are you prepared...

810
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,956
within six months of commencing
this venture...

811
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,111
to show adequate returns?

812
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,598
I accept your terms.

813
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,079
Don't do it, Joy.

814
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,071
What's the fourth question?

815
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:54,677
You are in a room,
and there is a gun on the table.

816
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:59,436
And the only other person in the room
is an adversary in commerce.

817
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,830
Only one of you can prevail.

818
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:07,751
Yet, you have protected your business
and Morris's money.

819
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,950
Do you pick up the gun, Joy?

820
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,715
That's a very strange question.

821
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,719
There is nothing strange
about this question at all.

822
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,791
This is money.

823
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,788
Do you pick up the gun?

824
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,193
I pick up the gun.

825
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,515
Good.

826
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,874
I'm going to remember that you said that...

827
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,348
when I speak to my lawyer.

828
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,630
What did Trudy's lawyer say?

829
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,756
He did a worldwide patent search.

830
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,353
What's a patent?

831
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,716
A patent is like a law
that you get to protect your idea.

832
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,236
A lot of people patent their ideas...

833
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,073
but only a few of them
actually get their ideas made.

834
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,831
So Trudy just wanted to be careful...

835
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,228
Joy...

836
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,234
I just wanted to let you know that
Touissant has almost finished his work.

837
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,753
And, um...

838
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,515
You know, we really need to find
some more work for him.

839
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,830
- You want more work in the house?
- Yeah.

840
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,797
I have another big job I have to go to.

841
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,159
- What?
- Yes.

842
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,476
- Well, but we have real issues here.
- Sorry.

843
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,960
- We don't have money for that work, Mom.
- Well...

844
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,680
Okay.

845
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,433
Joy...

846
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,240
What is happening to you, Mother?

847
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,118
I don't know what's going on.

848
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,832
Are you in love with Touissant?

849
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,349
I was feeling alone.

850
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,912
And I didn't even realize it,
you know?

851
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,229
And then...

852
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,870
What did the patent search find?

853
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,190
Trudy just wanted to be careful.

854
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,069
And this guy found a man that's in Texas...

855
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,879
who worked for another guy
in another country...

856
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,875
where they have an idea
that might be similar to my mop.

857
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,314
What country?

858
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,600
Hong Kong.

859
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,555
The Hong Kong man
has a representative in Dallas, Texas.

860
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,395
The Dallas man was very reasonable
with my lawyer.

861
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,715
Hey.

862
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,352
So, this guy in T exas...

863
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,949
We're supposed to pay him a royalty
on the patent as a protection, right?

864
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,040
Right.

865
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,638
T o be safe from any claims.

866
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,795
Is that correct?

867
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,916
Please stop using the word "we."

868
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,435
None of this is your money
or your business.

869
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,354
But the same guy
also owns a manufacturing plant...

870
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,438
that you guys say that it's cheaper
than any other place?

871
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,192
- Yes. In California.
- Yes.

872
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,749
A metal and plastic injection mold factory.

873
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,000
Okay, so it's the same guy.

874
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,712
- He owns the patent...
- This happens all the time in business.

875
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,155
You find the best partner. It's smart.

876
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,560
He doesn't understand business.
He doesn't know business.

877
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,120
- No, no, I'm the first to say that.
- I understand business.

878
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,436
Dad and I, we buy parts for the trucks
all the time at the garage.

879
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,272
Morris did it all the time.

880
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,749
One - Stop shopping. It's the cheapest.

881
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,194
- But is that normal?
- That's how he made his money.

882
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,480
- Yeah, that's normal.
- Yes!

883
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,198
But is it normal, the same guy
who has the patent...

884
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,080
is the same guy who has the manufacturing?

885
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,314
- Yeah. Make it best.
- Yeah.

886
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,272
- Yeah?
- Better if it's that way.

887
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,471
Okay, and the lawyer?
Right? Morris's lawyer?

888
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,198
- He's good. Let's not make trouble.
- He's very good.

889
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,632
But he specialized in garment business, no?
Not manufacturing business.

890
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,395
Tony. Let's quit while we're ahead.

891
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,798
I know that you want Tony
to be your counselor, If you will...

892
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,871
and I will respect that...

893
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,392
as Tony and you should respect
what we're proposing...

894
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,916
as the lawyer
for this whole business endeavor.

895
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,597
All right. The parts have arrived
from California...

896
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,995
and we can start manufacturing here.

897
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,829
I have the first assembled mop.

898
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,829
I told you it was gonna be more refined.

899
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,834
And it is.

900
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,315
Father Martinez is here.

901
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,595
You need to set those women up right now
and get going.

902
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,880
They're gonna be so grateful
for the jobs, Joy.

903
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,473
Okay. All right.
I'll go talk to those ladies.

904
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,875
Now I finally have jobs for them.

905
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,876
And I'll show you guys how to assemble...

906
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,950
I'm a little proud of you.
I gotta admit it.

907
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:16,439
But, It costs much more than $15,000
to make the first run.

908
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,715
I know, Trudy.

909
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,080
But with all due respect,
that actually wasn't my fault.

910
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,396
Look at this. More bills.

911
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,830
- What?
- Another bill from Gerhardt.

912
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,599
This guy keeps billing me
for his mistakes.

913
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,716
- That's business.
- No.

914
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,552
That's not the way I do business.

915
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,233
I'm calling this guy.

916
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,556
Gerhardt, I'm not gonna
keep paying for these parts...

917
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,233
that it's taking you
four times to get right.

918
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,278
That was your design.
You have to pay for those parts.

919
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,193
That's mold - Making.
That's the process.

920
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,635
My clients pay when we figure it out.

921
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,313
It was not my desig n, Gerhardt.

922
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,914
It was your mistake. I'm not paying it.

923
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,469
That was your design.
You have to pay.

924
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,477
Did you just hang up on him?

925
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,950
This guy was supposed to be easy
and inexpensive.

926
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,759
He keeps overbilling us.
I'm not paying for it.

927
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,590
Nobody pay it.

928
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,796
I'm gonna fight it out with this guy.

929
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,838
Just assemble them and try to sell them.

930
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,475
Just put it in your window.
Let your customers decide.

931
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,073
My family's been going to you
my whole life.

932
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,152
Look, the big companies,
they pay me for my shelf space.

933
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,108
Maybe you can sell one of your mops
to those big companies.

934
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,919
And maybe they'll put it on my shelf.

935
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:35,432
It's expensive, at $19.95,
but it's the only mop you'll ever have to buy.

936
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,758
But I don't want people
to buy one mop for $20...

937
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,558
and never have to buy another mop again.

938
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:46,669
I'd rather they keep buying our mops at $5,
50 times, 100 times.

939
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,951
Look, you were broke and bored.
You had an idea.

940
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,315
So what? Lots of people have ideas.

941
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,433
Go home.
Please, take care of your family.

942
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,351
Hi. Would you like to try a new mop?

943
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,673
It's the only mop
you'll ever have to buy.

944
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,876
- Hi. Would you like to try a new mop?
- No.

945
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,314
It's self - Wringing.

946
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,880
You can remove the mop head,
throw it in the washing machine.

947
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,995
- No germs.
- No.

948
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,189
No.

949
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,198
- No?
- Look at that.

950
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,271
You want to just try it?
You could just try.

951
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,597
It can self - Wring. See?
No other mop does this.

952
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,228
Come and try the brand - New mop!

953
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,317
- It's the mop of the future.
- No, thanks.

954
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,554
Want to try this mop, ladies?

955
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,914
- What's this?
- Hey, miss.

956
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,399
It's a brand - New mop.

957
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,391
You could wring it
without getting your hands dirty.

958
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,560
I don't think so.

959
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,672
Come on. Try it.
It's the mop of the future.

960
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,435
Self - Wringing, huh?

961
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,600
Yeah.

962
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,915
All right. I do like the idea of that.

963
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,914
I hate having to touch the mop head after
I get done cleaning the bathroom floor.

964
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,354
I always think that's disgusting,
you know?

965
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,555
It's so gross.

966
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,599
Wow. It really does get all the corners
that my sponge mop won't get.

967
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,031
All those crannies
where my kids spill their juice.

968
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,030
I really like it. Can we buy it?

969
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,599
Take it easy, Cristy.

970
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,957
Wow. I mean, that's just amazing.
You really don't have to touch it.

971
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,189
Look at that.

972
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,474
You know what would make this perfect...

973
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,949
if you could remove the mop head,
put it in the washing machine...

974
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,792
- Really get it clean.
- That'd be great.

975
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,589
- You can.
- What?

976
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,800
Are you serious?

977
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,110
- Well how much is this mop?
- It's $19.95.

978
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,280
No, that's too much.

979
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,240
But I guess, I mean, If it is the only mop
that you ever have to buy...

980
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,269
I mean we keep buying those
$5 mops.

981
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,634
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetie.

982
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:51,755
You, you remember Angela?
And her two brothers, right?

983
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,592
I do. Hello.

984
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,478
- Mommy, the policeman.
- Ma'am?

985
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,749
Did we break the law?

986
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,155
- I'm taking this merchandise.
- No, no. We're leaving. We're leaving.

987
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,878
- Now, I'm gonna let you off with a warning.
- We were just leaving.

988
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,359
No. Sir...

989
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,238
If the customers can just see
what the mop can do...

990
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,038
But if I catch you out here again,
you will be prosecuted!

991
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,269
Well, where do I go?
Sir, please!

992
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,476
- You cannot sell on Kmart property!
- I made those mops myself.

993
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,312
- I paid for them. Please.
- It took a lot of work.

994
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,600
I won't come back,
but you don't have to take my stuff!

995
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,716
Please!

996
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,910
- Are you even allowed to do this?
- How embarrassing for you...

997
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,559
to be seen here like this
with your daughter.

998
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,716
- What kind of parent are you, huh?
- Yeah, Tony.

999
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,880
- Enough.
- Hey.

1000
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,995
Hey, hey, guys. Guys...

1001
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,080
- All right.
- Come on.

1002
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,468
- Let's go.
- Tony, let's go.

1003
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,193
Yeah, I'm coming. I'm coming.

1004
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,038
Cristy, honey, It's okay.
Your mommy's okay.

1005
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,751
This stupid thing.
This place is falling apart!

1006
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,593
No... no.

1007
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,516
Honey, the telephone isn't working.

1008
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,999
I know. I just got the notice.

1009
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,351
I had to go next door to use the phone.
Tommy's got a fever.

1010
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,520
Tommy has a fever?

1011
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,473
Simple cold with a cough.
It's going around. All the kids have it.

1012
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,080
Thank God the heat's still working.

1013
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,350
Mommy, why isn't the phone working?

1014
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,198
Because I'm late on paying the bill.

1015
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,920
- Are we gonna lose our house?
- Not you too.

1016
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,592
No, we're not gonna lose our house.

1017
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,240
Come on. Get upstairs. Get in the bath.

1018
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,633
Listen to your mom and get
right in that tub.

1019
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,472
- I don't want a hot bath.
- I don't care.

1020
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,676
Cristy, you get in that hot bath.
Listen to your mother.

1021
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,717
I don't want you getting sick too.

1022
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,115
Lauren Wells said you're a cleaning lady
and sell used mops.

1023
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,472
Lauren Wells said that?

1024
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,239
Yeah. And it really hurt my feelings.

1025
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,151
First of all, even if I was
a cleaning lady, so what?

1026
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,117
There's no shame in hard work.

1027
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,311
And second of all, you know, I'm...

1028
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,595
I'm trying to sell a new mop,
not used mops.

1029
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:54,393
And third of all,
don't take any guff from anybody.

1030
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,077
You know, don't let it in.

1031
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,877
I know it's hard.
And I'm sorry that happened.

1032
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,794
Now get in the bath.

1033
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,477
Come on. Go to sleep, honey.

1034
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,075
Joy?

1035
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,719
Not now, Mimi.

1036
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,792
Joy, wait, wait.
Just tell me what happened today.

1037
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,315
I want to know how it went.
Please, I want to know.

1038
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,999
It was a disaster.

1039
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,000
But you must never give up.

1040
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,752
Ever since you were little,
you were born to bear...

1041
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,150
Born to bear what, Mimi?

1042
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,468
Failure? Disgrace?

1043
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,989
Humiliation in front of my daughter?

1044
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,713
You were born to be
the unanxious presence in the room.

1045
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,792
And I know that I'm gonna live
to see you grow...

1046
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,191
to be the successful matriarch
that you were born to be.

1047
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,360
Matriarch...

1048
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,908
T o be a mother with courage.

1049
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,957
Who can't even support her children.

1050
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,429
Sweetheart.

1051
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,237
What are you doing here?

1052
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,032
I have this idea.

1053
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,798
- A guy I know.
- What guy?

1054
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,954
He used to work with me.
And now he works at this big retailer.

1055
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,350
A new way of doing business.

1056
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,317
I mean, It's worth a try.

1057
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,591
You would do that for me?

1058
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,829
Of course.

1059
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,514
They were the best divorced couple
in America.

1060
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,199
Much better friends than they were
husband and wife.

1061
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,633
I can get you a meeting with him.

1062
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,439
Where is it?

1063
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,280
But I don't understand
what we're doing in Amish country.

1064
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,880
They don't even have electricity out here.
How could they sell anything on TV?

1065
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,275
It has nothing to do with Amish people.

1066
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,874
It just happens to be located here.
I looked it up.

1067
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,678
In Amish country.

1068
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,800
Amish.

1069
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,750
What?

1070
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,831
- Amish.
- Amish.

1071
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,073
Sign in, please.

1072
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,554
We're here to see Marv Brickman.

1073
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,349
Okay.

1074
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,069
Marv Brickman, does he know who you are
if I call his office?

1075
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,760
Of course he knows.

1076
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,672
We're friends. We used to work together.

1077
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,072
QVC, please hold.

1078
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,880
But Tom was wrong about that.
He was wrong about the numbers...

1079
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,149
Tony.

1080
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,469
Marv. How are you?

1081
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,993
I can't see you today.

1082
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,428
Why?

1083
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,477
Maybe tomorrow if you can stay in town.

1084
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,955
No, we left the kids at home.
We can't.

1085
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,917
We can't stay until tomorrow.

1086
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:11,038
Listen, you can't just expect
to come in here and see someone.

1087
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,474
Hey, did you take care
of that advertising thing?

1088
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,750
- Yes, I did.
- Good. All right.

1089
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:15,920
What's going on here?

1090
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,920
- This is my good friend, Tony.
- Tony Miranda.

1091
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,280
We worked together at Campbell's.

1092
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,360
Neil Walker.

1093
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,200
- And this is his ex - Wife.
- Good to meet you.

1094
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,508
- Joy.
- Hi. Neil.

1095
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,715
She's an inventor.

1096
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,920
She wanted two minutes of your time today,
but, Neil, don't worry about this.

1097
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,360
- Maybe tomorrow.
- You know what?

1098
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,114
Why don't you come in for five minutes
while the sales group's still here.

1099
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,719
- Okay. Hold my bag.
- Neil, are you sure?

1100
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,108
- Yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

1101
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,508
Thank you.

1102
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:37,715
- Got everything?
- Yeah.

1103
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,313
Great. Thank you, man.

1104
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,469
Thank you.

1105
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,232
So tell us your name, please.

1106
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,149
I'm Joy.

1107
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,157
And what would you like
to show us today?

1108
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,629
I have a self - Wringing mop.

1109
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,040
Just...

1110
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,080
Do you need some help?

1111
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,269
No. No, no.

1112
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,835
All right.

1113
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,672
That's my shoe.

1114
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,671
Oh, my goodness. I am so sorry, sir.

1115
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,353
Sock's wet.

1116
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,669
Do you mind?

1117
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,909
Sorry.

1118
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,039
Is that plastic?

1119
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,120
Yes.

1120
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,997
Arnold, why don't you give it a try?
Is that okay?

1121
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,229
Yes, of course.

1122
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,029
Just dunk it.

1123
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,713
- I dip it?
- Yes.

1124
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,509
And then I... twist it?

1125
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,039
But you pull...
You have to pull it first.

1126
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,428
- Pull it and twist it.
- You got to pull it first before you twist it.

1127
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,755
- I'm pulling it and...
- Pull and twist.

1128
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,915
And I am twisting it.

1129
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,760
Pull and twist,
just like when you're on the road.

1130
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:50,150
We don't mean to be disrespectful, Joy.
It's the end of a long day for us.

1131
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,791
I feel like I want to tell you
a little bit about who I am.

1132
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,270
Because I have a feeling you don't know
exactly where you are right now.

1133
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,400
Am I right?

1134
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,399
T en months ago...

1135
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:06,075
a man named Barry Diller
called me from Los Angeles.

1136
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,913
He started a television network.
Fox television channel.

1137
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,718
And prior to that, he ran 20th Century Fox,
among other studios.

1138
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,954
And he acquired a little cable channel...

1139
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,594
right here in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

1140
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,716
And he hired me to run it...

1141
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,516
as a bigger idea.

1142
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,671
Now, I'm from Detroit, Michigan.

1143
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:36,551
I ran America's largest, most affordable...

1144
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,553
successful, value - Driven retailer.

1145
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,472
Chain called Kmart.

1146
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,998
Prior to that, I was a buyer for Kmart.

1147
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:50,111
And prior to that,
i managed seven separate Kmart stores.

1148
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,791
I decide what products
we let into our stores here...

1149
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,994
into people's homes, 24 hours a day,
for our valued customers.

1150
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:04,153
I choose very carefully
and very conservatively.

1151
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,312
I spend most of my day deflecting
incoming shots from people like yourself.

1152
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,075
You see that chart?

1153
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,799
This green line either rises
or stays the same each month.

1154
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,478
There's no problem
with my product choice.

1155
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,560
Do you know what QVC stands for, Joy?

1156
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,629
No, I don't.

1157
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,756
Quality, Value, Convenience.

1158
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,717
I sell product affordably,
but I don't sell cheap product.

1159
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,348
And your mop is plastic
and it looks strange.

1160
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,195
I don't know anything about charts.

1161
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,400
Or...

1162
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,832
... business, frankly.

1163
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,671
But I do clean my own home.

1164
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,676
And I made this mop...

1165
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,991
because it is better
than anything else out there.

1166
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,832
Please give me a chance.

1167
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,519
I like that it's plastic...

1168
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,592
because it's so light in my hands,
it's like nothing.

1169
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,512
It's also ten times more absorbent
than any other mop on the market.

1170
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:21,669
Why?

1171
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:27,355
Because of 300 feet of continuous
cotton loop that I looped myself.

1172
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,233
That is an enormous amount
of absorbent cotton...

1173
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,118
on a very small mop head.

1174
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,750
Now I'm done with the bathroom,
and I haven't wrung the mop once.

1175
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,558
Let me ask you a question.

1176
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,719
Would you take this mop...

1177
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,233
where you were
just cleaning the bathroom...

1178
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,280
and around the toilet,
and all of those germs...

1179
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,790
and take it into the kitchen...

1180
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,428
where your family eats,
where you feed your children?

1181
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,632
I take this mop head,
i put it in the washing machine...

1182
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,438
it comes out clean like new.

1183
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,950
You can't do that with any other mop.

1184
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,913
- So...
- Stop.

1185
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,230
Can you make 50,000
of these mops by next week?

1186
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,078
Yeah, I think so.

1187
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,668
David Selznick, the son of immigrants...

1188
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,912
married Jennifer Jones from Oklahoma,
america's sweetheart.

1189
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,310
That just goes to show you
that in America...

1190
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,189
the ordinary meets the extraordinary
every single day.

1191
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,518
Thomas. Where are you going with that?

1192
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,272
The skinny pants you wanted.

1193
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,000
I never said "skinny pants."
I said, "stovepipe." Classic look.

1194
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,479
I heard "skinny pants"

1195
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,790
You know how much I love the stovepipe.

1196
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,752
- Stovepipe. Classic. Got it.
- Got it.

1197
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,680
- Fine, we'll go for stovepipe.
- Thank you.

1198
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:46,068
See those guys? I told them so many times
and they still don't understand.

1199
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,992
A very smart guy once said...

1200
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,436
"You tell somebody something once, they don't listen.
You tell somebody four times, they don't listen.

1201
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,632
"By the ninth time you say it,
they begin to hear you."

1202
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,552
That's why we're on 24 hours a day.

1203
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,360
That's why, with the people who I have
to tell about the stovepipe.

1204
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,039
Music in the makeup rooms?

1205
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,599
Yeah, I thought it'd
give a sense of place, Todd.

1206
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,955
But if you don't want it,
you can always turn it down.

1207
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,189
You're our biggest seller, Todd.

1208
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,351
Whatever you need to make you comfortable.
You're who we care about.

1209
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,600
You're our number - One seller.

1210
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,834
- What?
- Oh, no.

1211
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,553
He's your number - One seller?

1212
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,951
No, no, no. Cindy, please.
You know that we love you.

1213
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,028
Oh, for heaven sake.

1214
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:24,399
She's never had a professional attitude.
Clearly, she's jealous.

1215
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,552
But could you do me a favor?
Make her your friend.

1216
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,991
Could you just do me that favor, Todd?
Please?

1217
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,160
For me?

1218
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,195
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

1219
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,520
This is Joy. She has a very exciting new mop
that we're gonna introduce next week.

1220
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,920
I would like you to launch it.
You're my first choice.

1221
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,188
A mop?

1222
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,870
You want me to bring this newborn
into the world?

1223
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:50,232
That newborn that you're holding is
every cent, every dollar, even debt...

1224
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,435
that I've ever made.

1225
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,313
Every cent you've ever made?

1226
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,635
That's right.

1227
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,756
That kind of pressure is not helpful.

1228
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,593
- What?
- No

1229
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,990
It's not part of my process, either.

1230
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,549
Oh.

1231
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,236
- Todd...
- I didn't mean to pressure you, Todd.

1232
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,634
- Performers can be finicky creatures.
- He's very sensitive.

1233
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,030
He is our number - One seller.
He is selling everything through the roof...

1234
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,350
in numbers we've never seen before.

1235
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:17,915
I take it very seriously.

1236
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,150
I see it as a privilege that we have
to go into people's homes.

1237
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,958
And I despise anybody
who's cynical about that.

1238
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:25,510
Jack Warner wasn't cynical about that.
Darryl Zanuck wasn't cynical about that.

1239
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,398
And Neil Walker is not cynical about that.

1240
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,391
Let me show you the stage.

1241
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,597
I believe eventually, one day...

1242
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:37,595
television will even be
by and about actual regular people.

1243
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,991
Maybe even on computers,
24 hours a day.

1244
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,708
Who knows?
Nobody thought this network would be real.

1245
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,159
And here we are.

1246
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,120
- By the way, stock's going through the roof.
- What...?

1247
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,919
Must be mindful of Joan's dog.

1248
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:56,231
Who's... who's Joan?

1249
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,275
Thank you, darling.

1250
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:03,072
You're never gonna make it
in a man's world dressed like that.

1251
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,629
Mr. Peepers, you were almost
a Peepers pancake.

1252
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:09,515
It's a round stage that has four
or five different sets that rotate...

1253
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,353
depending on what we're selling
at a given moment.

1254
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,794
The clasp is part of the necklace. See?

1255
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,758
Look at the quality in this clasp.
That's what we do.

1256
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:17,920
Absolutely exquisite.

1257
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,317
Here comes Joan and Cindy.
Watch this.

1258
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,189
These guys are major.

1259
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,874
Joan's the original seller.

1260
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,360
If you're just starting your jewelry wardrobe,
can you do anything better than this?

1261
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,874
You're gonna mix in your blacks,
your golds, your pearls.

1262
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,029
- Everything.
- Everything.

1263
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,348
Look at it against the peach. Okay?

1264
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,033
- Look at that.
- Morning.

1265
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,679
- Look at that.
- Green. Afternoon.

1266
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,360
- Look. Black, night.
- Black, evening.

1267
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,670
- Of course at night.
- I mean, can you be more elegant?

1268
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,990
So it's functional. Elegant.

1269
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,720
You can wear it alone.
You can wear it... what I love...

1270
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,950
See. Stars and people,
they always make the mistake.

1271
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,997
They think it's about the face,
but it's not.

1272
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,639
It's about the hands.

1273
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,040
Because that's what people use.

1274
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:54,878
They hold things they care about.

1275
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,395
And her hands are gonna become
their hands.

1276
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,788
And that becomes them.

1277
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,315
And then their voice,
and then their eyes.

1278
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,993
Stars always make the mistake.

1279
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,477
It's really about the hands and the voice.
That's the heart of it.

1280
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,555
Number J - 6276.

1281
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,194
A $100 value.

1282
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:12,759
Are they not phenomenal?

1283
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,152
- Now watch this.
- These can be yours.

1284
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,834
- Cindy's gonna lay this down right...
- But you need to call in right now.

1285
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,035
$39.99.

1286
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,760
... now!

1287
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,911
You need this. You can get this.

1288
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,672
You need to call right now, though.

1289
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,515
- I'm being told we have limited quantity left.
- Watch the calls come in.

1290
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,352
Watch them. Here they come.

1291
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,875
For $39.99,
you might as well get several.

1292
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,235
Calls coming in now.

1293
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,038
Calls. Calls.

1294
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,391
Calls. Calls. Calls. Calls.

1295
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,596
Look at the count.
I guarantee we're gonna go over twenty.

1296
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,432
Those are FTC standards.
Those are legal.

1297
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,955
Those are coming in. Keep your eyes...
Those are actual sales, Joy.

1298
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,348
Lines are busy?

1299
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,033
- Is the queue full?
- Queue's full.

1300
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,233
Okay. We need a phone call right now.

1301
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,391
When they can't call through,
we gotta keep them watching.

1302
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,073
Did we get a call? Did we get a call?

1303
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,275
Okay. Got it.

1304
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,759
Keep this going. Phone call right now.

1305
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,000
Wait, wait, wait!
We have a caller! We have a caller!

1306
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,391
Sharon from Colorado. Hi, Sharon.

1307
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,520
Hi, Sharon.

1308
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,869
Cindy and Joan!
I can't believe I'm talking to you!

1309
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,278
Are you happy with your necklace?

1310
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,871
These necklaces are so gorgeous
and timeless.

1311
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,076
- My great - Grandmother had things like this.
- Y es, yes. Keep it going.

1312
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:18,312
I am so excited to have these.

1313
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:21,711
Keep it going. Y es. Y es. Y es.

1314
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,840
Get one for your mother.
Get one for your sister.

1315
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,319
Watch the counter, Joy. Joy.

1316
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,948
- You will not regret owning this.
- No, you will not.

1317
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,269
See those numbers?

1318
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,158
We're gonna wind up at 25,000.

1319
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,913
Cindy knows how to close it.

1320
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,160
Wow.

1321
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,076
Okay, I want you to go home,
i want you to call your lawyer.

1322
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,468
Look at your contract.

1323
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,114
Make sure your product factory
is in line.

1324
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,152
- Okay?
- Okay.

1325
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:48,232
Okay, Godspeed, good luck.
Here we go. I'll walk you out.

1326
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:55,995
You can't expect Trudy to write a check
for $200,000 for 50,000 mops...

1327
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,359
when you already owe her $18,000
to make mops you haven't even sold yet.

1328
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:07,959
Do you understand that there is a business
that wants to sell my mop on television?

1329
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,758
It's going to sell.

1330
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,989
Fine. You feel so strongly about it,
you put up half the money.

1331
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,590
Yes. It's only fair that you share
the financial risk, too.

1332
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:21,236
How's she gonna do that?
She's got nothing. She's got no money.

1333
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,913
What, do you want me to take out
a second mortgage on my house?

1334
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,275
They want me to take out
a second mortgage on my house.

1335
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,913
A second mortgage?

1336
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,433
But the house, the kids, Joy.

1337
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,636
What's gonna happen, Joy?
How would you do that?

1338
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:39,720
I don't know.

1339
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,192
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hey.

1340
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,828
You know I've been watching you through
that fence since you were a little girl?

1341
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,319
- Yeah.
- I've been watching you grow up.

1342
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,674
- Hey, listen.
- What?

1343
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,796
You think it would be okay if I...

1344
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,678
- You wanna fire a few rounds?
- I do.

1345
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,829
Yeah. Might make you feel better.

1346
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,080
Thank you. I think it will.

1347
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,673
- You know how to hold it?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1348
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,956
Okay. Sure.

1349
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:15,520
Good.

1350
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,155
Good.

1351
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,040
Good.

1352
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:20,915
Good.

1353
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,833
This is it! Oh, my gosh.

1354
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,671
Get ready. This is definitely
gonna change the holidays...

1355
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,718
for anyone who has a floor
or a bathroom...

1356
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,872
because we have the most exciting
new home product in years.

1357
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,160
Y eah!

1358
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,596
This is the new self - Wringing mop.

1359
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,760
Okay, okay, okay!

1360
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,673
It's the new standard in homes,
right here.

1361
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,832
Let's take a look at this.
This is brought to you only by Q VC.

1362
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,552
Now, this is clearly extremely
soft and absorbent cotton.

1363
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,554
There we go.

1364
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:13,030
You just take this, and you...

1365
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:14,709
start...

1366
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:18,515
I'm not sure.
This is a little trickier than it looks.

1367
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,600
Put it...

1368
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,388
Well, It's getting my arm wet, here.

1369
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,230
Let's see. We got no sales here.

1370
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:26,920
What happened?

1371
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,274
Is there a call?

1372
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,110
So there... so there are no calls.

1373
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:34,760
All right.

1374
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:41,515
And we do not have any sales still
so here's what we 're gonna do.

1375
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:44,235
We 're gonna move on.
Now, we 're gonna move on.

1376
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:48,677
Cindy is gonna talk to Sarina Kimball,
former star from Falcon Crest and Dynasty...

1377
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:54,077
and she is gonna tell us
all about her new line of gowns.

1378
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,477
These are my special occasion gowns...

1379
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,837
"Special." How apropos.

1380
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:07,473
... that were inspired by all of the times
that I was in Dynasty and Falcon Crest.

1381
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,916
That is absolutely amazing.

1382
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,230
I want you to pan in. Look at these.

1383
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,277
- Look at the detail.
- Look at the detail.

1384
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,118
Look at the value in that.

1385
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,271
About how many sequins
would you say that is?

1386
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,480
That's it?

1387
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,720
- That's all?
- No, It's over.

1388
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,994
That's how fast it happens.

1389
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,354
No, they're gonna give her
a second chance.

1390
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,158
No, they're not gonna give her
a second chance.

1391
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,316
That's not what's gonna happen.

1392
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,630
They're going to give her
a second chance.

1393
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,720
- Why do you have to be so negative?
- They will.

1394
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,631
$200,000!

1395
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,314
50,000 mops.

1396
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,230
Now, this is easily one of my favorites.

1397
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,913
She's wearing the black and gold...

1398
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,069
Joy.

1399
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:16,955
Hello?

1400
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,953
5,107 sequins for...

1401
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,157
Get this. How much?

1402
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,320
$299.

1403
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,191
I'm sorry the product didn't sell.

1404
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,278
That man didn't know
what he was doing, Neil.

1405
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,190
Well, It wasn't the man, Joy.
It was the product.

1406
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,716
I made 50,000 units
because you told me to.

1407
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:56,392
I mortgaged my house,
i'm in $200,000 of debt. More.

1408
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,640
Well, It's your business.
It's your debt.

1409
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,917
And we indemnify up to a third,
if you read your contract.

1410
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,400
To be honest,
that's even gonna be hard to get.

1411
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,675
Neil, you gotta give us another chance.

1412
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:13,748
I'm so sorry, Joy.

1413
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,718
I just can't bring it to my boss.
I can't.

1414
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,591
I can't accept your answer.

1415
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:26,071
I can't, and I won't.

1416
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,435
Joy, you have to let Trudy
report this loss in bankruptcy...

1417
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,398
because otherwise she's gonna
hemorrhage even more money.

1418
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,278
You have to file, too...

1419
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,113
because you mortgaged your
children's future and you lost...

1420
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,748
and you have to
prepare yourself for that.

1421
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,599
You have to file for bankruptcy.

1422
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,716
I warned you so many times, Joy!

1423
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,520
Dad, I warned you
to not spend her money!

1424
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:50,597
Come on! You've been plotting against her
from the very beginning, Peggy!

1425
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,313
Now we 're bankrupt, Tony!

1426
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,192
I'm in a meeting with our lawyers.

1427
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,234
What do you think you're doing?

1428
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:05,274
"Go home, Joy, and watch the numbers
roll in on television.

1429
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,588
"Make 50,000 mops...

1430
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:12,435
"borrowing and owing every dollar,
including your home."

1431
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,680
It could have been handled better.

1432
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,159
I'll let Todd have another shot.

1433
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,312
I don't want Todd
or anyone else to try it.

1434
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,152
It should be me.

1435
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:22,480
We don't have regular people.

1436
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,757
We have celebrities or spokesmodels
do the selling.

1437
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,393
I told you this.

1438
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,838
Who showed you the mop?

1439
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,070
Who sold it to you?
Who taught you how to use it?

1440
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,676
And who convinced you that it was great
after you thought it was worthless?

1441
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,591
Excuse me, can you give us a second?

1442
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,113
Come with me.

1443
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:58,240
You ever been in front of a TV camera?
You comfortable in front of a TV camera?

1444
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:02,159
Because when you get there, there's lights
and there's camera, and people freeze up.

1445
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,672
You said to me that David Selznick,
the son of immigrants...

1446
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:09,355
married Jennifer Jones,
an all - American girl from Oklahoma...

1447
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:13,354
because in America,
all races and all classes...

1448
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,717
can meet and make
whatever opportunities they can.

1449
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:22,113
And that is what you feel when you reach
into people's homes with what you sell.

1450
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,112
You said that.

1451
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,833
What do you think? Looks great, right?

1452
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,312
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Beautiful.

1453
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:36,879
Very vogue, very classic.

1454
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,868
All right, If you come back next time...
Lori? Lori?

1455
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:45,160
I just want you to just put the hair a little bit
forward, just like that, If she comes back again.

1456
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,670
Okay? Not with the comb,
not with the comb.

1457
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,353
- Try the black.
- Okay.

1458
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,635
Okay?

1459
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,840
It's gonna be perfect.

1460
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,600
Wow.

1461
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,594
Beautiful. What do you think?
How do you feel?

1462
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,719
I'd like to change just one thing.
Would you mind?

1463
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,275
- Okay, surprise me.
- Small thing.

1464
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,360
I'll surprise you.

1465
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,589
Okay, surprise me.

1466
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,438
What would the small thing be
that she changes?

1467
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,440
What?

1468
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,678
You undid the whole thing.

1469
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:35,720
This is me.

1470
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,915
This is you?

1471
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:39,560
You've got the exact same outfit
you had when you came in here.

1472
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,795
I wear a blouse and I wear pants.

1473
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,632
That's who I am.

1474
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,752
I want to go on as me.

1475
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,399
Gonna go on as you.

1476
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,632
I hope you make it back.

1477
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,510
Joan, Cindy. Say good luck to Joy.

1478
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,669
- Wow.
- Wow.

1479
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,040
You look great. Good luck today.

1480
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,120
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

1481
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,520
That's her, that's how she is.

1482
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,915
Blouse and... she should be in a skirt.
She's got nice long legs.

1483
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,195
Show her legs.

1484
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:03,315
Good luck.

1485
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:06,552
Joan Rivers wants me in a skirt,
but I'm gonna do pants.

1486
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,153
Do what you want to do.

1487
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,073
Come on, let's go upstairs.

1488
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:20,960
Are you nervous?

1489
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,120
Yes.

1490
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,068
Just be yourself.

1491
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:25,840
Just remember, It's all about the hands.

1492
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:27,829
Here we go.

1493
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,352
Ready... stage is moving!

1494
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:51,038
Household product 375 in three, two...

1495
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:59,034
What are you doing? Come on.

1496
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,515
Go! Go!

1497
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,513
She's freezing.

1498
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,954
Sorry, these lights are so bright.

1499
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:14,312
Nobody tells you how bright these lights...
Well, Neil did tell me.

1500
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:19,397
Neil is my boss. Here.

1501
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,394
I should thank him
for letting me be up here.

1502
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,199
- Sorry.
- You're Joy.

1503
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,360
I am Joy.

1504
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,398
Just say something!
Talk about the mop!

1505
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,560
Oh, my God.

1506
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:32,869
We have to do something.

1507
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,559
We have to do something.

1508
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,548
Do we have a call?

1509
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:38,709
- Could we go to a call?
- We have a call.

1510
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,069
- It's a friendly call?
- It's a friendly call.

1511
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,390
Okay. Take it. Take it.

1512
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:43,909
Joy, we have a call.

1513
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,196
A call? How did that happen?

1514
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,593
Well, we have a call.

1515
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,359
Hi. Joanne from New York.

1516
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,560
Joanne from New York.

1517
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,154
We have a call coming in
from Joanne from New York.

1518
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:58,877
Yeah, I'm calling in because I would love a mop
that I don't have to touch when I wring it.

1519
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,998
You know, my hands get raw
and when I mop broken glass...

1520
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:04,913
and I wring the mop, I cut my hands.

1521
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,075
Do you ever cut your hands
when you're wringing?

1522
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,549
Joanne, that is so funny
that you said that.

1523
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:16,111
That is actually exactly how
I was inspired to invent this mop.

1524
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:21,354
There was glass shattered everywhere.
I was with my two kids, with my father, and I...

1525
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,796
Every time I would wring the mop,
i would get glass shards in my hands.

1526
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,277
And the old mop
just wasn't very absorbent.

1527
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:33,560
So I went to my daughter's room,
and I borrowed her crayons...

1528
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:36,280
and I designed this mop.

1529
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,069
Make sure you get down there.
Yeah, that's it.

1530
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,840
It's made of plastic, so it's lightweight,
but very durable.

1531
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,399
Go in. Go in to the hands.

1532
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,469
It's extremely absorbent...

1533
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,949
with 300 continuous cotton loops...

1534
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,475
that I looped myself
when I designed it.

1535
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,752
- How much is it?
- It is $19.95.

1536
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,311
I like that price.
I want a whole bunch of them.

1537
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,308
Thank you.

1538
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,391
H375. That's the order number.

1539
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,630
Household item 375.

1540
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:01,840
I guarantee you...

1541
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,149
That's it. Stay right there.

1542
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:05,390
... you are not going to find
another mop like this that exists.

1543
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:08,916
If there was, I would have bought it
and I wouldn't have cut my hands up.

1544
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,788
You can get across the whole kitchen
with one wring. Just imagine that.

1545
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:15,279
Watch this.

1546
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,913
Chocolate syrup.

1547
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,229
Go the syrup. Go the syrup.

1548
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:24,000
Baby food.
A very big spill at my house.

1549
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,479
Very common spill for me.

1550
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,158
No. Hands, hands.

1551
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:31,588
Now, the biggest difference, I don't
have to touch this disgusting mop head.

1552
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,637
There's not another mop on the market...

1553
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:38,351
that has as much absorbent cotton
as this mop right here.

1554
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:42,308
And I guarantee you,
there will be no regrets, no returns.

1555
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,517
I have been mopping for most of my life,
every single day.

1556
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:46,680
Phones are ringing!

1557
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,080
I cannot tell you how much
this mop has changed my life.

1558
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:51,116
- Phones are ringing! Phones are ringing!
- The phones are ringing. The phones are ringing.

1559
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,200
Go.

1560
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:55,272
This is gonna be the greatest mop
to have around Christmas time...

1561
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,317
when you have family over...

1562
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:01,479
I am a mother of two.
There is just spill after spill.

1563
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,278
Family comes to town.

1564
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,869
You can mop your entire kitchen
with one wring!

1565
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,873
Oh, my God! 29,000!

1566
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,633
This is very special!

1567
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,394
I haven't even told you about
my personal favorite feature...

1568
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,551
which is the removable mop head...

1569
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:20,555
that I can put into the washing machine
and it will come out clean as new.

1570
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,119
Yes! Yes!

1571
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,589
Oh, my God, these numbers keep climbing!

1572
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,709
Thank you. I...

1573
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,240
Yes, that's right. Keep it going.

1574
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,395
Thank you.

1575
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,433
This is the most absorbent
mop on the market. It's lightweight.

1576
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:36,916
It's the only mop that you're ever gonna buy,
the best mop you're ever gonna use.

1577
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:41,358
It is lightweight and durable, and that is
just me speaking from my experience.

1578
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:45,599
As someone who mops their house
every single day, from my heart.

1579
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:50,071
This woman's gonna be
a whole new business.

1580
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:52,960
No way.

1581
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,719
Oh, my God.

1582
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,276
Can you believe it?
Can you believe it?

1583
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:26,836
I thought for sure you were gonna tell me
that your counting machine was broken.

1584
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,672
I listened to you. You were right.

1585
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:31,354
I just can't believe
that actually happened.

1586
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,520
I know.

1587
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,069
I guess you could say
we're friends in commerce.

1588
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,280
Friends in commerce.

1589
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:37,395
Yeah.

1590
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:40,995
Let's promise each other that if, one day,
and that day may come...

1591
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:44,470
that we become adversaries in commerce,
that we remain friends.

1592
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,278
Because that's a true friendship indeed.

1593
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,668
Friends in commerce.

1594
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,311
I agree. Let's shake on it.

1595
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,911
We've got 10 looms...

1596
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:36,595
and then when they're completed,
this is where the mop heads are sewn.

1597
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,159
Who makes your parts?

1598
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,352
A factory out in California.

1599
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,199
It was cheaper and faster
than any place around here.

1600
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,715
Smart. Are they gonna be able
to stay on schedule?

1601
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,195
Yeah.

1602
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,434
One time.

1603
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:19,160
- Right there.
- Thank you.

1604
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,480
- You're welcome.
- Right here?

1605
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,240
Hello?

1606
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:25,435
Mimi.

1607
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,349
Mimi.

1608
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,995
I so hated to leave her that day.

1609
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:50,754
I had so much I wanted to say to her.

1610
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,716
And to my great granddaughter.

1611
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:01,554
I felt I wanted to stay near her
and watch over her.

1612
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,272
Cristy.

1613
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,191
There's a problem in California.

1614
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:21,518
There can't be a problem in California.
I told Neil that everything was fine.

1615
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:24,672
Gerhardt keeps raising his price.
He just did it again.

1616
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:25,840
More money per unit.

1617
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:29,196
He can't do that.
We're gonna lose money.

1618
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,476
I sent a representative to handle him.

1619
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:34,520
Representative?
We don't have a representative.

1620
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:36,238
What representative?

1621
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:37,988
Peggy went.

1622
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:39,395
Peggy?

1623
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,836
I don't want to talk about this
right now.

1624
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,028
She wanted to be part of it.

1625
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,191
How could you send Peggy?

1626
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,876
She wanted to be part of it.

1627
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:09,793
You both are blood relatives.
You're half - Sisters.

1628
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:13,714
It's very, very important
that you love and respect each other.

1629
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:20,518
I paid them the 20
that you owed them. I had to.

1630
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:25,795
I got them to fill the order
of the 100,000...

1631
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,428
with a price increase
of only two dollars per unit.

1632
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:33,196
We can't increase at all, Peggy.
Don't you understand?

1633
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:38,159
We sold at a certain price.

1634
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,629
Any hikes,
especially the ones he's asking for...

1635
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,677
mean that I will lose so much money...

1636
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:49,072
that I'll be in even more debt
than I was before.

1637
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:52,752
You're gonna make it back.

1638
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,716
I'm gonna make it back?

1639
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:57,560
How?

1640
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,836
I've got ideas, you know.

1641
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:09,115
There are things that I'd like to do.

1642
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:12,955
I spoke to him about a project
that Dad and I have been designing.

1643
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,269
Right, Dad?

1644
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:15,919
Yes, we did.

1645
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:22,716
Do you have any idea
how much your idea will cost?

1646
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,950
How or where you'll sell it?

1647
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:28,791
If you can even manufacture it
after it's taken everything we've got...

1648
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,475
to sell this one product that now,
thanks to you...

1649
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,631
is going to cost more money?

1650
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,999
Maybe my product
is better than your product.

1651
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:40,549
I can do what you did on TV.
It's not that hard.

1652
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:44,315
Isn't that the whole purpose of that channel?
It's that everybody could do it?

1653
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:50,355
What your sister does is not easy...

1654
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:54,354
but what we were planning to do...

1655
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:58,195
is not that difficult.

1656
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,952
Listen to me.

1657
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:07,392
Never speak on my behalf...

1658
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:13,470
about my business again.

1659
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:18,113
Now I have to go to California.

1660
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:20,389
Can I help you?

1661
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:22,591
I'm Joy. I'm here to see Gerhardt.

1662
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,679
He's not available.

1663
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,109
I'll wait.

1664
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,875
She says she's here to see Gerhardt.

1665
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:34,840
Gerhardt!

1666
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:44,636
Hey. I'm Gerhardt.

1667
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,199
I'm Joy.

1668
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:47,588
Come on in.

1669
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,079
Derek Markham is my boss.

1670
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:50,309
He lives in Texas.

1671
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:54,798
Fabri - Pac is one of several companies
he owns or collects royalties for.

1672
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:58,316
I report to him.
He makes pricing decisions.

1673
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:01,438
Well, I've never met or talked
to this Derek Markham...

1674
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:03,278
but I've talked to you many times
on the phone.

1675
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:04,873
And I do find it very curious...

1676
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,998
that the second I'm on television,
with a lot of success...

1677
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:10,469
the price for our products goes up.

1678
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:13,313
Seems very unfair to me,
to say the least.

1679
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,275
Seems like you're shaking us down.

1680
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:18,715
You met Gregory, our plant foreman.

1681
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:21,189
It's very hard for us to lower the cost
at this point.

1682
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,830
We're already losing a lot of money.

1683
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:27,077
How could that possibly be,
with the $500,000 that we've given you...

1684
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:29,390
on top of the
$50,000 of advance royalties...

1685
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:32,677
that have gone to a Derek Markham
in Dallas.

1686
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,040
And that's not even counting
what my sister paid you...

1687
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:36,718
without my authority, by the way...

1688
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:39,553
for your overcharges and your mistakes.

1689
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:43,915
Your sister paid the increase
that you refused to pay.

1690
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:48,074
Well, she had no authority to do that.
She's not an officer of my corporation.

1691
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:53,596
You and I could both spend a lot of time and
money in court to prove that I'm right...

1692
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,398
but that would just make
our lawyers wealthy...

1693
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,949
while my product dies
instead of being on television...

1694
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,917
like it could be right now.

1695
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,638
You can pay more.

1696
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:06,754
I can't pay more. I won't.

1697
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:09,718
Costs are higher.
Wear and tear on the molds.

1698
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,876
We have to remake them every other week.

1699
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:14,873
Is that so? Can I see the molds?

1700
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:16,439
They're in the machines.

1701
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:19,433
It'll take some time
to prepare them for you.

1702
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,351
Is there a bathroom I could use?

1703
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,875
Yeah, It's down the hall.
Gregory will show you.

1704
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,195
Thanks.

1705
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:03,309
What?

1706
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:08,673
What are you doing in here?

1707
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:10,594
What is this?

1708
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:13,638
These are my designs,
these are my molds!

1709
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:14,800
Those are ours!

1710
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,956
And we knew you'd be trouble.
The cops are on their way.

1711
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,236
- We called 'em as soon as you showed up!
- These are my molds!

1712
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,469
Those are ours!

1713
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:22,517
I'm taking these with me.

1714
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,080
I'm taking all of these with me.

1715
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:26,435
I want all of these boxed up,
and I'm taking them.

1716
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:27,749
You're trespassing!

1717
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,148
It's not your patent!

1718
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,477
These are my designs!

1719
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:35,149
I'm not going anywhere without my molds.

1720
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,672
What? No. No.

1721
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,115
This is not stealing,
this is my property!

1722
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:41,435
This is my property.

1723
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:44,910
I have all of these designs.
These are all mine. They belong to me!

1724
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:48,709
She's from out of state, John!
You've known me 15 years!

1725
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,518
All right, come on, ma'am.
You're trespassing.

1726
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,272
- What?
- Yeah. Come on.

1727
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:53,793
- I'm not trespassing.
- Yeah, you're trespassing.

1728
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
I was in his office.

1729
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:56,513
- You don't know. Come on.
- He let me into his...

1730
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:58,079
Gerhardt, you're not gonna
get away with this.

1731
01:34:58,240 --> 01:34:59,639
- You're not gonna get away with this!
- Be careful what you're saying.

1732
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:01,711
- You're a thief! You're a thief, Gerhardt!
- Be careful, come on, come on.

1733
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,114
Be careful. Come on, stop it.

1734
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,350
- This is stealing!
- Hey, hey, stop it. Come on.

1735
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:06,520
All right.

1736
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:11,596
Watch your step. All right.

1737
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:20,868
What about Trudy's money, Joy?

1738
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,031
You have to pay back Trudy's money.

1739
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:24,758
This is only getting worse.

1740
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:26,797
I predicted tragedy, Joy.

1741
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:29,191
You're racking up quite a steep bill.

1742
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:32,477
We had to fly out here, bail you out.

1743
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:35,632
Plus it cost us an extra $10,000
for Ray Cagney...

1744
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:38,189
this California patent attorney,
to get us to this point.

1745
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,874
We got the state to decline prosecution.

1746
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,110
They see it's a contract dispute.

1747
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:46,795
When you paid royalties
to Derek Markham in T exas...

1748
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:50,919
it put all your parts and molds
under the umbrella of their patent.

1749
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:55,037
I see you brought your drawings
and hung them to prove your design.

1750
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,714
But it's impossible to fight it now.

1751
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:00,314
You were not properly advised.

1752
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:03,033
Cristy, please!

1753
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:04,200
Tony, take her to bed.

1754
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,516
I don't wanna go to bed.
I wanna stay here.

1755
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,033
I paid those royalties...

1756
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:09,240
because you told me to.

1757
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:12,119
Because your lawyer told me to.

1758
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:16,034
Our lawyer was mistaken.
This happens sometimes in business.

1759
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:17,394
It didn't work out for you.

1760
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:18,595
It happens sometimes.

1761
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:20,113
Trudy's lawyer is not a patent attorney.

1762
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:21,599
Which I said!

1763
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:25,719
And you said I had no business
being Joy's advisor.

1764
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,638
- And now it turns out that I was right!
- This is not helpful, Tony!

1765
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,800
- That's enough, Tony. Please.
- It's enough, now?

1766
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,514
I'm very sorry.
I wish there was more I could do.

1767
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:35,837
But when your sister Peggy paid
the unjustified bills...

1768
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:37,678
that you refused to pay...

1769
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:39,273
it closed the door on that.

1770
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:41,152
What about Neil Walker and QVC?

1771
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:43,834
Wouldn't they pay the expenses
on defending the patent?

1772
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:45,600
Be careful, Joy.

1773
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:49,389
You could be sued for misrepresentation
and failure to deliver your product.

1774
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:50,560
That's breach.

1775
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,751
QVC requires that you deliver
a fully patented product.

1776
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:57,309
I've been doing this for a long time.

1777
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:01,439
You're in for a long court process
that will stall your product.

1778
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,079
And you will probably lose.

1779
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:04,639
I wish I could do more.

1780
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:07,633
Take care, now.

1781
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:10,075
You're gonna have to accept
the facts, Joy.

1782
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:11,719
I mean, that's...

1783
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,276
You're most of half a million dollars
in debt.

1784
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:16,271
I don't know how you're gonna pay it.

1785
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,278
We have to declare bankruptcy.

1786
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:20,874
You're gonna have to declare bankruptcy.

1787
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:22,434
I have to declare bankruptcy.

1788
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:23,600
She has to.

1789
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,240
- To try to contain my losses.
- Yeah.

1790
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:26,509
I have to write it off.

1791
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:28,591
It just seems so wrong.

1792
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,318
We've worked so hard.

1793
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:32,550
We've come so far
for us to just give up now.

1794
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,199
It just seems so unfair!

1795
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:36,828
Business is unfair. That's it.

1796
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,036
It's not working out.
Well, that's what happens.

1797
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:42,875
That's why people don't go around
making invention every other day.

1798
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:44,115
Wake up!

1799
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:45,200
It's my fault.

1800
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,158
I gave her the confidence to think she was
more than just an unemployed housewife...

1801
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:51,039
selling plastic kitchen stuff
to other unemployed housewives...

1802
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,269
on a junk cable channel.

1803
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:55,159
It's my fault.
It's not your fault, honey.

1804
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:57,960
It was my mistake to make her think
that she was more than she was.

1805
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:00,828
She pressured herself into doing
something she shouldn't have done.

1806
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,080
It was wrong of you
to put that pressure on yourself.

1807
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:05,430
It was wrong of us
to put that pressure on you.

1808
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,033
I need more vodka.

1809
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:12,832
It was wrong of us to think that you'd be
an instant business person overnight.

1810
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,560
Of course, this is not who you are.

1811
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:21,469
It takes a kind of toughness,
a certain acumen...

1812
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:24,438
that you simply don't have.

1813
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:26,439
Sign the paper.

1814
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,434
You have to sign
these bankruptcy papers, honey.

1815
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:36,160
The notary's right outside.
Let me get her.

1816
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:42,360
You're gonna have to move
out of your house immediately.

1817
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,880
You're gonna have to move
into an apartment.

1818
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:47,436
Maybe you can move into a room
in Trudy's house.

1819
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:48,715
With the children?

1820
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,233
Yeah. You have room.

1821
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:52,593
She's my daughter. Why not?

1822
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,512
Let's talk about it.

1823
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,520
Trudy, we have to offer her something.

1824
01:38:57,680 --> 01:38:58,680
Again?

1825
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,034
Why me?

1826
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,432
Please sign, honey.

1827
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:36,875
Thank you.

1828
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:45,077
Mimi said you were the one born
to help carry the family to success.

1829
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:51,393
No, Cristy. Mimi was wrong.

1830
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:55,070
The world does not give you opportunities.

1831
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:59,995
The world destroys your opportunity
and it breaks your heart.

1832
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:04,235
I should have listened to my mother
when I was 10 years old.

1833
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,080
I should have spent the rest of my life...

1834
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:09,157
watching TV and hiding from the world
like my mother.

1835
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,674
So I don't wanna hear
any more about Mimi.

1836
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:14,309
She was wrong.

1837
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:17,916
She had her head in the clouds
and it was full of stupid ideas.

1838
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,275
And it gave me stupid ideas.

1839
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:23,800
Like this.

1840
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:28,790
This stupid, stupid idea!

1841
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:34,320
Mommy, don't tear them! No!

1842
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:58,190
Cristy, I'm so sorry.

1843
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,470
I'm sorry, Cristy.

1844
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:02,198
I'm so sorry.

1845
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:04,794
Please go to bed.
Everybody just go to bed.

1846
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:07,792
Good night, Mommy.

1847
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:10,155
Good night, sweetheart. Just go to bed.

1848
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:15,234
I'm so sorry I failed you, Joy.
I'm so sorry.

1849
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:17,072
Just, just don't.

1850
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:50,955
Joy? Joy?

1851
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:53,039
Joy, where are you?

1852
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:56,792
Joy, where are you?

1853
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:11,799
It's open.

1854
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:20,879
You can leave the door open.

1855
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,871
No one knows I'm here.

1856
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:51,871
You don't even know who I am.

1857
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:57,558
I could be Derek Markham or I might be
someone Derek Markham sent to handle you.

1858
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:00,031
You have no case.

1859
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:04,439
Maybe people think you came to Dallas
in despair to take your own life...

1860
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:09,549
because you were in such deep financial
trouble suddenly from your little venture.

1861
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:19,516
I made a phone call this morning
to Hong Kong.

1862
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:25,228
It was 1:00 a. M. In California but it was
5:00 p. M. The following afternoon in Hong Kong.

1863
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:29,757
I always think it's amazing
how time works like that.

1864
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:34,557
And I was fortunate enough to get
on the phone with Mr. Christopher...

1865
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:37,797
who I found to be very friendly,
which was surprising...

1866
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:41,077
because I really haven't found the
gentlemen in California to be very nice...

1867
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:43,629
considering we're all
in business together.

1868
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:47,588
Welcome to the world of business,
i guess.

1869
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:51,000
I told Mr. Christopher
that the reason that I was calling...

1870
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:55,073
was to discuss the differences
in the designs of our products.

1871
01:45:55,760 --> 01:46:00,117
But I quickly learned
that Mr. Christopher has no idea...

1872
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:06,435
if his Hong Kong patent for a self - Wringing
mop is worth anything or if it even works.

1873
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:12,108
Because they have not made
or sold a single mop.

1874
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:16,109
Unlike us, who have sold over 200,000.

1875
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:21,995
And I've paid you over $50,000
in advanced royalties...

1876
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:24,116
on behalf of Mr. Christopher.

1877
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:29,595
Blood money from my family
and my second mortgage.

1878
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:35,118
Turns out Mr. Christopher doesn't know
anything about those royalties.

1879
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:36,793
So it seems...

1880
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:41,589
we have a case of fraud and embezzlement.

1881
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:47,791
And, as if that weren't bad enough...

1882
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:54,198
I also discovered in the paperwork that our
mops actually don't bear any similarities.

1883
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:57,477
So I never did owe you
any royalties for your patent.

1884
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:00,476
That's another case of fraud.

1885
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:07,030
My lawyers really could go after you,
but I told them, "Give me a day."

1886
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:13,150
To see if maybe
you might've made a mistake...

1887
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,958
that you would correct,
given the chance.

1888
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:36,352
We'll pay you back all the royalties
you paid us.

1889
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:46,030
I'll give you $20,000
on top of paying you back the 50.

1890
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,228
Okay.

1891
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:04,674
I'll give you $50,000
on top of paying you back the 50.

1892
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:18,352
Plus interest.

1893
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:25,791
I want all of my molds back.

1894
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:28,749
I want you to sign
this piece of paper...

1895
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:33,076
saying that you have
no rights, financially.

1896
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:37,595
I'm just gonna add...
I said the 50...

1897
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:41,631
plus the 50...

1898
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:46,113
plus the interest.

1899
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:50,398
So I just want you to initial
next to those two numbers as well.

1900
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:57,953
So just sign there.

1901
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:08,428
She put up with just about anything.

1902
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:11,914
Until when she had to
bring the hammer down...

1903
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:15,118
she brought the hammer down.

1904
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:20,119
She couldn't know what was to come.

1905
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:25,118
That she'd go on to make
another 100 record - Setting patents.

1906
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,595
Skinny velvet hangers
make neater closets.

1907
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:32,115
That's a big deal to a lot of people.

1908
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:35,669
I mean, who thinks of things like that?

1909
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,154
Joy did.

1910
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:47,673
She didn't know any of this would happen
as she walked down the street that day.

1911
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:52,313
Yes, sir, tonight's the night for Ol'
Saint Nick to make his yearly visit...

1912
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:54,511
to all the folks all over the world.

1913
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:58,150
There's fun and expectation
in every house across the land.

1914
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:02,433
And speaking of houses, what do you say
we take a little look - In on a typical one?

1915
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:10,833
Now I'll admit that what you see right now is
just a small piece of the front of the house...

1916
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:14,794
but all you grownups and kids alike,
this is the time for Santa's magic...

1917
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:18,157
so I think we can make it
become a real house.

1918
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:20,473
Even a house with love in it.

1919
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:23,712
Mr. Santa Claus, can we have
a little snow, please?

1920
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,711
Thank you. That's fine.

1921
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,039
Now, Santa, let me see what it
really looks like inside this house.

1922
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:05,916
She couldn't know that one day
she would move into a big beautiful home.

1923
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:10,755
Her mother was happy.

1924
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:15,758
She remained close to her,
and with the rest of her family...

1925
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,673
which was, as always, complicated.

1926
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:25,994
She would pay for products made by
Rudy, Trudy, and Peggy.

1927
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:28,276
Even when they failed.

1928
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:33,675
Even when they wrongly sued
for ownership of her company.

1929
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:39,270
As Rudy got older, Joy continued
to take care of him and love him.

1930
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:50,797
As Neil Walker predicted,
joy did become a whole new business.

1931
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:53,196
And even outgrew Q VC.

1932
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:55,360
- She's talking to her children.
- Is T ony in there?

1933
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:56,719
Yes, T ony's in there.
The family's in there.

1934
01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:03,035
Her ex - Husband and her best friend
would remain her steadfast advisers.

1935
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:04,553
Please be patient.

1936
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,470
I love you.
You guys go and pack your rooms.

1937
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:14,437
- Good night, Mom.
- I love you.

1938
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:24,555
- Hi.
- Hi.

1939
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:26,392
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

1940
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:30,149
What do you have?

1941
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:31,992
A traveling clothes cleaner.

1942
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:33,160
Let's see it.

1943
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:35,269
So you're from Memphis?

1944
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:36,668
Yes, I am.

1945
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:37,989
You work as a waitress?

1946
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:39,309
Yes, ma'am.

1947
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,988
All right. Let's see it.

1948
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:44,669
You made this yourself?

1949
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:45,840
Yes, I did, ma'am.

1950
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:49,070
I made my first invention myself, too.

1951
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:52,511
I like this, It's a very good design.

1952
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:53,715
Thank you.

1953
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:56,314
Can you stay an extra day,
meet with our designers?

1954
01:52:57,160 --> 01:52:58,354
No, because of your boss?

1955
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,752
What hotel are you staying in right now?

1956
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:03,520
- The Holiday Inn, ma'am.
- Holiday Inn.

1957
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:05,636
Let's move them over to the Radisson,
get them a suite.

1958
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,480
You'll be more comfortable
with your baby.

1959
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:10,318
I'll call your boss and get it taken care of,
give you an extra day...

1960
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:12,761
so that tomorrow you can come in,
meet with the designers.

1961
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,712
- We can take it step by step, all right?
- Thank you.

1962
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:16,632
We'll work on your idea,
see if we can do something.

1963
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,631
This means so much to me.

1964
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:20,359
I know what it feels like.

1965
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:22,876
I know what it feels like
to be in that chair.

1966
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:25,560
- We'll see you tomorrow, okay?
- Thank you, ma'am.

1967
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:26,868
And good luck.

1968
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:28,560
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

1969
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:31,399
- Go get the next person, Tony.
- Okay.

1970
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:32,880
Neil.

1971
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,150
Sorry, we have legal stuff
with Barry, now.

1972
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:41,879
Yes, we do.

1973
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:46,073
Here we are.

1974
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:49,750
Adversaries in commerce.

1975
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:52,755
Adversaries in commerce.

1976
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,717
- And friends.
- Yes.

1977
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:57,354
And friends.

1978
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:01,234
I'm gonna tell you something
but you didn't hear it from me.

1979
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:03,720
I don't know who you are
or what you're talking about.

1980
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:05,518
That's what I wanted to hear.

1981
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:09,196
Barry's gonna come after you, hard.

1982
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:12,756
But that's just business.
That's the way Barry is. He's a negotiator.

1983
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:15,070
Ultimately, he needs you.

1984
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:18,431
He's buying HSN.

1985
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:21,910
It's all about HSN now,
and he wants you to come with him.

1986
01:54:24,360 --> 01:54:25,918
He needs you.

1987
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:28,750
You're going to be very big over there.

1988
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:31,236
That's what's going to happen.

1989
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:34,438
But, you didn't hear it from me, right?

1990
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:39,232
No, I sure didn't.
But thank you.

1991
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:44,511
It's nice to see you.

1992
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:46,238
It's good to see you.

1993
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:50,596
I'll see you around, pal.

1994
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:52,716
Yeah.

1995
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:00,949
It's been a long journey.

1996
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:02,160
Yes, It has.

1997
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:03,320
I'm proud of you.

1998
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:04,674
Thank you, Neil.

1999
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:42,389
This right here,
this is a special power.

2000
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:46,157
This is a special power.

2001
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:54,156
And then I started to build
my very own house...

2002
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:58,514
where I would live
and make wonderful creations...

2003
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:02,030
for all the world to see and love.

2004
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:10,188
She didn't know any of
this would happen...

2005
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:13,233
as she walked that day.
