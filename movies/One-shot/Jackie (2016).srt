1
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,237
Mrs. Kennedy?

2
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:17,615
They told me to come up.

3
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,577
And I'm so sorry
for your loss.

4
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,622
Have you read
what they've been writing?

5
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:27,625
Krock and Merriman
and all the rest?

6
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:30,753
Yes, I have.

7
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:33,631
Merriman is such
a bitter man.

8
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:36,551
It's been just one week.

9
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:39,637
Already they're treating him
like some dusty old artifact,

10
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,139
to be shelved away.

11
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:44,559
That's no way
to be remembered.

12
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:47,145
And how would you like him remembered,
Mrs. Kennedy?

13
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,313
I...

14
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:53,109
You understand that I will be
editing this conversation?

15
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:56,946
Just in case I don't say
exactly what I mean.

16
00:03:57,363 --> 00:04:00,825
With all due respect, that seems very unlikely,
Mrs. Kennedy.

17
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:09,542
Right.
Okay. Uh...

18
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,839
So, this will be your own
version of what happened?

19
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,966
Exactly.

20
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,302
Come in.

21
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:26,684
I thought it was
another backfire.

22
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:29,582
I very nearly didn't go.
What if I'd been here

23
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:34,359
or out riding
in Virginia somewhere?

24
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:37,570
Thank God
I was with him.

25
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:40,531
Why, "Thank God"?

26
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,910
Do you know what
I think of history?

27
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:47,246
Of history?

28
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:50,458
I've read a great deal.
More than people realize.

29
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,085
The more I read,
the more I wonder...

30
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,505
When something is written down,
does that make it true?

31
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,006
It's all that
we have.

32
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:58,174
Had.

33
00:04:58,257 --> 00:04:59,801
We have television now.

34
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:02,387
At least people can see
for their own eyes.

35
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:06,557
That tour of the White House
that you did a couple of years ago for CBS,

36
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:12,155
I always assumed
that you did that for

37
00:05:12,155 --> 00:05:13,648
a purpose? No?
After the fashion magazines?

38
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:14,899
You even won an Emmy.

39
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,318
I didn't do that
program for me.

40
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:19,904
I did it for
the American people.

41
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:22,532
That program was my first glimpse
into the White House

42
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:25,034
and, for whatever it's worth,
I thought you were excellent.

43
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:26,411
Very poised.
Oh, thank you.

44
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:29,247
You could have had a career
as a broadcaster, I'm sure.

45
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:30,540
What?

46
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:34,544
I'm sorry?

47
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:35,962
What did you say?

48
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:38,881
I said you could have
a career...

49
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:40,717
Could have had a career
as a broadcaster.

50
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,760
Are you giving me
professional advice?

51
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:48,433
I'm not.

52
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,479
But I am sure that the whole
country would like to know

53
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:54,772
what you're going to do next.

54
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:57,984
I can assure you,
not television.

55
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:01,654
Welcome to the White House.

56
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:05,533
Welcome to the White House.

57
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,910
We're so proud
to call it home.

58
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:11,414
Why don't you try,
"The People's House"?

59
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:13,416
Make it more personal.

60
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,878
Welcome to
The People's House.

61
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,338
We're so proud
to call it home.

62
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:20,631
Better?

63
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,843
When will Jack join us?

64
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:26,012
They want to
hear from you.

65
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:27,722
They think I'm a fool.

66
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,974
One year in office,
wasting their money.

67
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:32,477
That's why you need to show
them what you've done.

68
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:35,313
The President will join
you in the Monroe Room

69
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:36,814
at the end
of the tour.

70
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:38,941
You'll be great.

71
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,527
Stay close.
Of course.

72
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:45,323
You look beautiful. Go.

73
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,160
Hello.
Excuse me.

74
00:06:57,168 --> 00:07:00,671
This is the White House
as seen from its South Lawn.

75
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:04,672


76
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:02,548
For the next hour,
Mrs. John F. Kennedy

77
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:05,051
invites you to visit
the President's House

78
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:08,471
and see some of the restorations
she's made in its interior.

79
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:11,099
Mrs. John F. Kennedy,

80
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:13,777
third-youngest of the 29 wives

81
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:15,335
to live in the White House.

82
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,236
Mrs. Kennedy,
I want to thank you

83
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:25,947
for letting us visit
your official home.

84
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,826
This is obviously the room
from which much of your work on it is directed.

85
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:33,079
Yes, it's attic and cellar
all in one.

86
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:34,455
Since our work started,

87
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:37,333
we receive hundreds
of letters every day.

88
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:40,294
This is where we evaluate
all the finds,

89
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:41,587
and see if we want
to keep them,

90
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,714
if they'll fit
into our budget.

91
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,342
Mrs. Kennedy,
every First Lady

92
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:50,221
and every administration since
President Madison's time,

93
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:53,724
has made changes, greater or smaller,
in the White House.

94
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,060
Before we look at any
of the changes you've made...

95
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:59,355
Now, what's
your basic plan?

96
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:03,109
Well, I really
don't have one.

97
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:07,530
Because I think this house
will always grow, and should.

98
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:10,955
It just seemed to me such a shame
when we came here to find

99
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:14,495
hardly anything of the past
in the house.

100
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:17,248
Hardly anything before 1902.

101
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:23,379
Now suppose that you and your committee
were to acquire some of the things

102
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:26,591
that are in this room, what happens when
the next President's wife

103
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:28,426
comes into the White House?

104
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:32,930
Well,
if they don't want it...

105
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:36,726
In the past, you see,
they could sell it or throw it out.

106
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:42,231
And the talk of the taxpayer
money being wasted?

107
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:46,360
Oh, I raised every dime privately
that we spent on that restoration.

108
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:48,154
I... I loved that house,

109
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,448
and I wanted to share it
with the American people.

110
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:53,659
To impart a sense
of America's greatness.

111
00:08:54,493 --> 00:09:00,082
Objects and artifacts last far longer than people,

112
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,700
and they represent

113
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:04,003
important ideas in history,

114
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:06,797
identity, beauty.

115
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:10,384
But I'm sure that, uh,
the readers would like to know

116
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:14,138
what it's like to be
a member of your family?

117
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:20,019
Imagine a little boy
surrounded by all of this.

118
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,855
Having his older brother
die in battle,

119
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:24,357
and then going off
to that same war

120
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:26,025
and coming home a hero.

121
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:29,445
People see
that little boy,

122
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:33,032
born to wealth
and privilege,

123
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:36,994
willing to sacrifice
everything for his ideals

124
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:39,038
in service
to his nation.

125
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:41,249
Royalty. You make him
sound like royalty.

126
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:45,336
Well, for royalty
you need tradition.

127
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:48,839
And for tradition,
you need time.

128
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:54,136
Well, I guess it has
to start somewhere, right?

129
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,515
There has to be a day one.

130
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,184
This is the East Room,

131
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:04,355
pretty much as Americans
have known it now for 60 years.

132
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,815
Obviously you haven't felt that

133
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,401
you had to make any
great changes in here.

134
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:11,028
No, I think it's lovely.

135
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,114
I hate to make changes really,

136
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,616
so when you find
a room like this,

137
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,201
it's wonderful. This...

138
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,328
This piano brings to mind

139
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:24,375
that, uh, this is the part of the White House
where you have the musical affairs.

140
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:29,547
That's right. This piano was
designed by Franklin Roosevelt

141
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:31,048
with the eagle support.

142
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:36,929
And this is
the end of the room

143
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,848
where Pablo Casals played for us,
where we had a portable stage built,

144
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:40,725
when we had
the Shakespeare players.

145
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:46,439
Mrs. Kennedy, this administration
has shown a particular affinity

146
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:49,900
for artists, musicians,
writers, poets...

147
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:53,362
Is this because
you and your husband just feel that way,

148
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:55,614
or do you think
that there's a relationship

149
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,867
between the government
and the arts?

150
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,245
That's so complicated.

151
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,164
I... I don't know.

152
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,770
I just think that everything

153
00:11:05,771 --> 00:11:06,625
in the White House
should be the best.

154
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:31,423
And if it's
an American company

155
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:32,610
that you can help,
I like to do that.

156
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,946
If it's not...
Just as long as it's the best.

157
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,479
Is your faith helping you?

158
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:12,024
I'd prefer to discuss
my faith with a priest.

159
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,486
You're not a man
of the cloth, are you?

160
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,905
No. No, I'm not.

161
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,115
I'm just trying
to get to the truth.

162
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:21,283
That's what reporters do.
Oh, the truth.

163
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:23,494
Well, I've grown accustomed
to a great divide

164
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:26,539
between what people believe
and what I know to be real.

165
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:31,669
Fine. I will settle for
a story that's believable.

166
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:33,504
That's more like it.

167
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:37,550
You know, I used to be
a reporter myself once.

168
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,302
I know what
you're looking for.

169
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:41,804
I'm sorry?

170
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,640
A moment-by-moment account.

171
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:47,560
That's what you came
here for, isn't it?

172
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:54,900
You want me to describe the sound the bullet made
when it collided with my husband's skull.

173
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:12,042
I'm very happy

174
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:23,011
to be in the great State of Texas, to be with you
and experience the noble Spanish tradition

175
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:26,056
that has achieved so much in Dallas.

176
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:27,933
This tradition

177
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:37,902
started 100 years before the colonization
of Massachusetts, my husband's State.

178
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:46,285
It is all a tradition
that remains alive and strong.

179
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:56,420
Is that the sound of birds?

180
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:59,882
Uh, not exactly birds.

181
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:02,551
Must be the ocean.
Hmm.

182
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:04,762
You ready?
Of course.

183
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,889
I love crowds.

184
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:19,568
You remember Governor
and Mrs. Connally.

185
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:22,154
Welcome to Dallas,
darling.

186
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,823
Thank you so much
for coming.

187
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,283
Very nice to meet you.

188
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,457
My! What a welcome!

189
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,110
There'd been the biggest
motorcade from the airport.

190
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:04,488
Hot, wild,
like Mexico or Vienna.

191
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:07,658
The sun was strong
in our faces,

192
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:10,160
but I couldn't wear
my sunglasses.

193
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,454
Jack has his hand out,

194
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:16,625
and I see a piece
of his skull come off.

195
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,046
And it was flesh-colored,
it wasn't white.

196
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:23,924
And he slumps in my lap.

197
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:26,969
His blood
and his brains are in my lap.

198
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:31,849
And I'm saying, "Jack,
"Jack, can you hear me?

199
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,893
"Jack! I love you, Jack!"

200
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,566
And his head was so beautiful,

201
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:45,487
and his mouth was beautiful,
and his eyes were open.

202
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,662
I was trying to keep
the top of his head down.

203
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,206
Keep it all in.

204
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:03,047
He had the most wonderful
expression on his face, you know?

205
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:05,424
Just before
they'd ask him a question,

206
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,217
just before he'd answer,

207
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,762
he looked puzzled.

208
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,516
I knew he was dead.

209
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:26,028
Mrs. Kennedy, uh...

210
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,406
Don't think for one second
that I'm going to let you publish that.

211
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:35,371
You understand?

212
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:36,747
Yes. Yes, of course.

213
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:38,374
Yes, I understand.

214
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:44,880
What did the bullet
sound like?

215
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,035
Mrs. Kennedy?

216
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,580
Are you all right?
It's Larry.

217
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,707
I'll be ready
in a moment.

218
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,543
Take all the time
you need.

219
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:14,636
Are they waiting?

220
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,642
"I do solemnly swear..."

221
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,728
I do solemnly swear...

222
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:24,646
"...that I will
faithfully execute..."

223
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,024
...that I will
faithfully execute...

224
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:30,277
"...the office of President
of the United States."

225
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,571
...the office of President
of the United States.

226
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:35,574
"And will to the best
of my ability..."

227
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,659
And will
to the best of my ability...

228
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:40,871
"...preserve, protect..."
...preserve, protect...

229
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:42,706
"...and defend..."
...and defend...

230
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,501
"...the Constitution
of the United States."

231
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,836
...the Constitution
of the United States.

232
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:49,713
"So help me God."

233
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,423
So help me God.

234
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,449
Mr. President.

235
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,118
Start the engines.

236
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:22,746
Get some of the heat
off this plane. Thank you.

237
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,727
Can you tell me
what size the bullet was?

238
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:50,524
I don't think
it was a.38, was it?

239
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:51,692
It seemed...

240
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,944
What's that called,
the caliber?

241
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:55,821
It seemed bigger.

242
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,739
It seemed like something
soldiers would use,

243
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,658
or maybe what they use
for deer hunting...

244
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,118
Mrs. Kennedy,
you don't have to...

245
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:03,412
We don't know yet.

246
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,956
We need to have
the Irish cadets.

247
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,165
I'm sorry?

248
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,294
Yes. The Irish cadets,
for the funeral.

249
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:11,988
Jack loved them.

250
00:20:11,989 --> 00:20:13,922
He saw them
perform in Dublin last summer.

251
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,757
Of course, Mrs. Kennedy.
We'll make sure of it.

252
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:18,260
And those bagpipers
from Scotland we just had.

253
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,928
What were they
called, Kenny?

254
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:21,597
The Black Watch.

255
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,390
The Black Watch.
That's right.

256
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:24,850
The Black Watch Pipers.

257
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:27,269
When we arrive,
we'll be exiting the rear of the plane.

258
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,855
You, the President...
President Johnson, that is.

259
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,981
Why the rear?

260
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,232
There's press at Andrews.

261
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:33,400
Not to mention
the security risk...

262
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,110
Am I supposed
to hide away? Now?

263
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:36,194
Not hide.

264
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,405
Oh, I'm sure those people
would love that.

265
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,283
What do they call themselves,
The Birch Society?

266
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:45,871
No, I will not sneak out
the back door.

267
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:48,832
I will go out the usual way.
We all will.

268
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:50,834
I'll arrange it.

269
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,336
When we land,
Mrs. Kennedy,

270
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:55,464
we'll need to proceed directly
to the hospital for the autopsy.

271
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,049
The autopsy?

272
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:59,217
Is that necessary?

273
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:00,802
I'm afraid it's required.

274
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:02,346
By who?

275
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:03,889
The law, Mrs. Kennedy.

276
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,353
And what exactly
will they do?

277
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:13,106
I'm not sure...

278
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,693
What does an autopsy entail?
I want you to explain to me.

279
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:19,321
I want to hear
all the details.

280
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:22,324
I'm his wi...
Whatever I am now.

281
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,661
I want all the details.

282
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,371
What, will they
slice him open?

283
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,872
Darling.

284
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:33,835
Can I send somebody
to help you change

285
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,712
before we land?

286
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,715
All those cameras.

287
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,717
People will be watching.

288
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:45,389
There were wanted
posters everywhere.

289
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:47,933
For Jack.

290
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,227
With Jack's face on them.

291
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:54,189
Let them see
what they've done.

292
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:02,614
Jackie?

293
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,574
Bobby.

294
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:15,043
Sir, there's a car waiting
on the tarmac

295
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:17,629
to take you and Mrs. Kennedy
to Bethesda.

296
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:37,274
Mrs. Kennedy and I will ride
with the casket in the ambulance.

297
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,192
Valenti wants to know

298
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:41,111
how we're going to handle the exit.

299
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:42,195
The exit?

300
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,906
He says Johnson
wants to talk to the press.

301
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:47,826
He can do whatever he wants.
We're leaving now.

302
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,556
The casket will be closed,
won't it?

303
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:10,640
At the funeral?

304
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:12,184
We'll sort that
all out later.

305
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:14,978
I want it closed
so badly, Bobby.

306
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:18,982
I'm not sure it can be
for a head of state.

307
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,653
There was blood
everywhere.

308
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:27,616
There were
so many pieces.

309
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:28,784
Jackie...

310
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:30,994
I tried to hold
his head together.

311
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:34,122
Hey!

312
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:35,665
Slow down.

313
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,928
The President
was lying motionless in the car.

314
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:50,305
Mrs. Kennedy was
leaning over him.

315
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:52,015
Governor Connally was
leaning back in his seat,

316
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,184
holding his stomach
with both hands.

317
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:57,020
Inside the emergency room,

318
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:59,272
witnesses said the First Lady,
splattered with blood,

319
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,191
waited without a word.

320
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:09,407
Jackie, Jackie...

321
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:13,036
Come on.

322
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:17,207
Make sure they make him
look like himself.

323
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,251
I know.

324
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:22,379
Where are the children?

325
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:23,839
They're with Maud.

326
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:26,133
She's taken them
to the house in Georgetown.

327
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,051
I'd rather them at home.

328
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:29,594
Their routine
shouldn't be disrupted.

329
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:31,429
Yes, yes, yes.
Of course. Mary...

330
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,557
I'll see to it.
What do they know?

331
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,726
...that cannot be weighed.

332
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:39,354
For me, it is a deep...

333
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:41,773
You need some rest.
Oh.

334
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:43,942
I think she needs water.

335
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,278
Thank you, Nancy.

336
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:52,033
It had to be some
silly little Communist.

337
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:53,994
If he'd been killed
for civil rights,

338
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:55,829
then at least it would
have meant something.

339
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:56,913
You know?

340
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,123
Jack warned me.

341
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,667
Jack said, he said
we were going to nut country,

342
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,170
but I thought
it was going well.

343
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:05,213
At Fort Worth. In Houston.
I know.

344
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:07,883
I kept... All the problems
that Adlai had...

345
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:11,052
Jack was winning him over.
Shh. I know.

346
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:14,181
They... They handed me
yellow roses.

347
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:16,516
Yellow roses.
At every stop.

348
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,395
Then in Dallas...
I know.

349
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:22,772
Here, let's turn this off.

350
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,486
They want a show of grief.

351
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:31,156
They're already asking
about funeral arrangements.

352
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:03,980
Darling. Come.

353
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:08,735
President Johnson
met with Secretary of State Rusk.

354
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,779
Minutes later,
there was a hastily added

355
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:13,323
conference with
Secretary of Defense McNamara.

356
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:14,730
Even at a time of sorrow,

357
00:26:14,731 --> 00:26:16,743
the harsh facts of the Cold War

358
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,662
do not allow a pause in overseeing

359
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:20,789
the affairs of defense
and foreign policy.

360
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:25,168
There seems little doubt that McNamara
will stay on under Mr. Johnson.

361
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:26,503
A new president...

362
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:31,531
Lyndon's people
are claiming

363
00:26:31,532 --> 00:26:33,760
I told him to take
the oath in Dallas.

364
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:37,055
Asshole couldn't wait, and now they're
blaming me for it.

365
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:51,069
Excuse me.

366
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:54,489
Do you know
who James Garfield was?

367
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,033
No, ma'am.

368
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:02,998
Do you know who William McKinley was,
what he did?

369
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:09,504
They were both U.S. presidents
killed while they were in office.

370
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,258
And what about Abraham Lincoln?

371
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:15,719
Do you know what he did?

372
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:18,221
He won the Civil War.

373
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:20,682
He abolished slavery, ma'am.

374
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:22,100
That's right.

375
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:24,102
Thank you.

376
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:28,898
Bobby, please tell them
I want the books on Lincoln.

377
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:30,066
About his funeral.

378
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:46,680
You'll have to share something
personal, eventually.

379
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:48,598
People won't stop asking
until you do.

380
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,100
And if I don't
they'll interpret my silence

381
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:52,227
however they want?

382
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,646
"Her brow furrows.

383
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:56,481
"Her lips are drawn.

384
00:30:57,315 --> 00:31:00,944
"She holds back her tears,
but she can't hide her anger."

385
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:03,821
Most writers
want to be famous.

386
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:05,031
You want
to be famous?

387
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:06,991
No, I'm fine as I am,
thank you.

388
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:08,368
You should
prepare yourself,

389
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:11,329
this article will bring you
a great deal of attention.

390
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:13,915
Ah. In that case,
any advice for me?

391
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:15,250
Yes.

392
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:18,169
Don't marry the President.

393
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:23,258
Are you afraid I'm about to cry again?

394
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:25,760
No, I'd say you're
more likely to scream.

395
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:26,844
Scream what?

396
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:29,806
"My husband was a great man."

397
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:37,564
Lincoln's funeral cortege
departed the White House,

398
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:40,650
progressed along
Pennsylvania Avenue

399
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:41,985
to the Capitol.

400
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,403
And the next day

401
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:45,071
returned to
the White House,

402
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:47,407
then they walked all the way to St.
Matthew's

403
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,826
in a long, grand procession.

404
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,828
It was a sunny spring day.

405
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:54,080
Only 600 tickets were allotted,

406
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:55,331
but thousands,

407
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:58,167
thousands lined the streets
and rooftops,

408
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:00,837
citizens, senators,
congressmen,

409
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:02,755
diplomats, officers,

410
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:05,842
all in their
full dress uniforms.

411
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:09,762
Lincoln's mount,
Old Bob,

412
00:32:09,846 --> 00:32:13,182
was draped in a black blanket
with white trim and tassels.

413
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:15,584
Hooded,
he was led rider-less,

414
00:32:15,585 --> 00:32:17,967
the head of
a miles-long procession

415
00:32:17,968 --> 00:32:19,939
by the Reverend Henry Brown.

416
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:21,774
I can feel Jack
getting angry with this.

417
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:26,029
"There you go,
spending all that money

418
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:32,869
"on those silly
knick-knacks."

419
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:37,290
The man would spend
whatever it took for votes,

420
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:39,792
but balked at buying
a beautiful painting.

421
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:46,549
We don't have to worry
about that anymore.

422
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:52,013
We must get
this right, Bill.

423
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:53,640
We must get this right.

424
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:57,393
It has to be beautiful.

425
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:01,481
Did you tell them we'll need
a horse-drawn carriage?

426
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:04,484
We have to
march with Jack.

427
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,069
Everyone.

428
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:09,822
A big, beautiful procession
that people will remember.

429
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:12,909
Mrs. Kennedy,
you don't have to do this.

430
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:15,495
Do what?

431
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:19,165
In fact, I don't think they'll let you parade
through the streets.

432
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,585
The world's gone mad.

433
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:25,505
You should take the
children and disappear.

434
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:28,341
Build a fortress in Boston
and never look back.

435
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:31,928
Mrs. Kennedy?

436
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:35,515
Are the children awake?

437
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:37,725
They're playing
in Caroline's room.

438
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:44,190
How do I do this?

439
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:45,692
Oh, dear.

440
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:48,444
It doesn't matter
what you say.

441
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:51,531
Just hug them and tell
them it will be okay.

442
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:08,214
Mommy,
why are you dressed so funny?

443
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:12,468
Because something
very sad has happened.

444
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:16,931
And this is how we dress
when something sad happens.

445
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:19,600
Mommy, where's Daddy?

446
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,603
Daddy's not coming home.

447
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:24,480
Why not?

448
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:29,652
Daddy had to go see
your baby brother Patrick.

449
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:31,320
In heaven.

450
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:32,905
Why?

451
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,657
Because I'm here with you.

452
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:39,120
We don't want Patrick
to get lonely, do we?

453
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:42,749
But what about us?

454
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:50,673
Caroline, I need you
to be a big girl.

455
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:55,636
You can be brave, right?
You can be a soldier?

456
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:01,267
A very bad man hurt Daddy.

457
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,479
Daddy would come home
if he could.

458
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:06,689
But he can't.

459
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,525
He has to go to heaven.

460
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:15,531
Can I say goodbye?

461
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:20,203
Yes, of course you can,
my love.

462
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:25,124
Let your ears be attentive
to my cry for mercy.

463
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:29,796
If you, O Lord,
kept a record of sins,

464
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:32,507
O Lord, who could stand?

465
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:36,552
But with you
there is forgiveness,

466
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:39,138
therefore you are feared.

467
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:44,727
I wait for the Lord,
my soul waits,

468
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:47,396
and in his word
I put my hope.

469
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:50,733
My soul waits for the Lord

470
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:53,694
more than watchmen wait
for the morning.

471
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:59,742
O Israel,
put your hope in the Lord,

472
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:03,871
for with the Lord
is unfailing love.

473
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:23,683
That was
a beautiful mass.

474
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:28,187
Excuse me, Mother. Jackie.

475
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:38,197
Have you started on
the guest list for the burial?

476
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:39,615
The what?

477
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,868
You'll need to
pare it down, dear.

478
00:36:41,951 --> 00:36:45,621
We can't possibly accommodate
all these people at Brookline.

479
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:48,875
Mr. Kennedy,
we need to discuss the funeral, sir.

480
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:51,346
We all want
to follow her lead,

481
00:36:51,347 --> 00:36:53,129
but we still don't know
much about this Oswald.

482
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:55,131
There may be
co-conspirators.

483
00:36:56,424 --> 00:36:59,719
I'll talk to her,
but she makes the call.

484
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,929
There's also the matter
of the Oval.

485
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,309
What do you want me
to do first?

486
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:08,750
Hmm? Plan the funeral
or pack the furniture?

487
00:37:08,751 --> 00:37:09,990
I know this is
all delicate.

488
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:11,397
That's why
I'm approaching you.

489
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:13,232
But a procession is insane.

490
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:15,151
Brookline?

491
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:16,986
The family plot.

492
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:22,241
Well, I assume Jack will be
buried with the rest of us.

493
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:24,261
A crowd full of people,
given what's happened,

494
00:37:24,262 --> 00:37:26,329
I just can't have
my President walking.

495
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:28,497
Your President?
My President.

496
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,668
Well, regardless
of what happens,

497
00:37:32,752 --> 00:37:34,670
my brother is going
to be carried in a box.

498
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:36,339
And I am
sorry, sir.

499
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,592
Fuck off, Jack.

500
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:49,268
Averell Harriman owns

501
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:52,021
at least four properties
in Georgetown.

502
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:54,690
I'm sure he could
loan out one of them.

503
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:56,692
I'll have Sarge
look into it.

504
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:57,944
I'm sure we have time.

505
00:37:58,027 --> 00:38:00,363
They can't expect us to
move immediately, can they?

506
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:03,699
Of course not.
Don't be silly.

507
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:06,035
Lincoln's widow
died destitute.

508
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:09,288
She moved back to Illinois,

509
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:11,791
had to sell
all her furniture.

510
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:15,294
And the Van Burens
and the Tylers, too.

511
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,881
She auctioned it off,
piece by piece,

512
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:20,883
just to keep a roof
over her head.

513
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:22,885
But that
won't happen to you.

514
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:24,887
And the collectors
we bought it from...

515
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:26,138
Remember? Bill and I,

516
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:28,808
we had to haggle
over every sofa, every chair.

517
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:33,479
If I sell some of it
back now,

518
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:36,482
maybe I can put John
and Caroline through school.

519
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:39,902
This staircase
goes up to the second floor,

520
00:38:40,027 --> 00:38:44,490
which I know are reserved for the private living of
the President and his family.

521
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:46,909
I don't think
any television cameras

522
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:49,787
or motion picture cameras
have ever gone up there,

523
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,081
'cause that's where you live.

524
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,582
That's right.

525
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:58,087
Here is what the White House
did to President Lincoln.

526
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:00,756
Here is how he changed.

527
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:03,676
1861.

528
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:06,512
The strong man
with the arched eyebrow.

529
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:08,764
1865.

530
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:12,768
One week before
his assassination.

531
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:16,939
Mrs. Kennedy, do you spend
a great deal of time

532
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:18,065
in the Lincoln Room?

533
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:20,860
It was where we lived
when we first came here,

534
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:22,528
when our rooms
at the other end of the hall

535
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:23,696
were being painted.

536
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:24,780
It's a nice room.

537
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:27,199
Was this a bedroom
during Lincoln's time?

538
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:30,036
No, it was,
uh, Lincoln's Cabinet Room.

539
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,580
Are all the pieces
from Lincoln's time?

540
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:36,542
Uh, yes, they are.

541
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:40,046
The most famous one,
of course, is the Lincoln bed.

542
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:42,214
It was bought by Mrs. Lincoln,

543
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:44,050
along with
the dressing bureaus

544
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:46,135
and chair, and this table.

545
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:49,805
Um, she bought a lot
of furniture for this house,

546
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,891
which made her husband
rather cross

547
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:54,477
because he thought
she spent too much money.

548
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:03,569
And on the table
is the Gettysburg Address.

549
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:07,907
This is probably the greatest
treasure in this room.

550
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:12,661
And this sofa
and these two chairs,

551
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:15,081
they were sold
in that Lincoln sale

552
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:16,749
I was telling you about,

553
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:18,375
that Mrs. Lincoln sold.

554
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,422
And they went to England,

555
00:40:20,423 --> 00:40:24,340
and then through the descendants
of the man who brought them there.

556
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:26,842
Here he comes, here he comes.

557
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:28,094
Bobby?

558
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:30,846
Here he comes out
and down the hall again.

559
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:36,352
I really don't know
what this situation is about.

560
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:39,647
Nobody has told me anything,
except that I'm accused of...

561
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:42,358
I don't mean
to upset your mother,

562
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:45,444
but Brookline is no place
to bury a President.

563
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:54,954
Did you
kill the President?

564
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:57,123
No, I've not
been charged with that.

565
00:40:57,206 --> 00:40:59,375
In fact, nobody has
said that to me yet.

566
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,710
First thing I heard
about it was when

567
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:04,213
the newspaper reporters
in the hall...

568
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:24,150
Welcome to Arlington,
Mrs. Kennedy.

569
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:25,401
Thank you.

570
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,336
The third option
is just over there,

571
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,588
at the base of that hill.

572
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:47,256
That's too low.

573
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:48,591
What do you think, Ken?

574
00:41:48,716 --> 00:41:51,427
I did like Dewey Circle, if we could get rid
of the leaves in time.

575
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:53,262
Well, the problem
there isn't just the leaves.

576
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:54,889
It's the access roads.

577
00:41:56,015 --> 00:41:57,516
There's gonna be
10,000 people here.

578
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,518
Well,
that's what I'm saying.

579
00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:00,769
Jackie?

580
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:08,527
Jackie.

581
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:23,292
Where are we going?

582
00:42:23,417 --> 00:42:25,294
He can't just be
buried anywhere.

583
00:42:26,128 --> 00:42:27,296
He deserves more.

584
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:31,800
Watch your step.

585
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:36,388
You all right?

586
00:42:36,472 --> 00:42:38,474
My shoes are sticking
in the mud.

587
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:32,820
I think maybe you should
talk to a priest.

588
00:43:36,198 --> 00:43:37,449
Maybe.

589
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:42,871
Bobby, I want to
talk to the press.

590
00:43:42,955 --> 00:43:43,998
No.

591
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:47,209
No. You let
Dave handle that.

592
00:44:00,723 --> 00:44:02,474
You know, that first night
Bob McNamara said

593
00:44:02,558 --> 00:44:05,311
he'd buy back our house
for us in Georgetown.

594
00:44:08,981 --> 00:44:11,066
I don't even
have things. I...

595
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,651
I don't have things.

596
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:14,320
I don't even have a home.

597
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:16,238
And what about this house?

598
00:44:16,322 --> 00:44:19,491
This? It's awfully cold.

599
00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:22,328
Well, you could light a fire,
invite people over.

600
00:44:24,913 --> 00:44:26,582
The parties that you threw
at the White House,

601
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:28,709
nobody had ever
seen anything like that.

602
00:44:29,585 --> 00:44:33,756
Private concerts with artists,
friends, drinking champagne

603
00:44:33,881 --> 00:44:34,923
and singing...

604
00:44:35,007 --> 00:44:36,759
Are you suggesting
I throw a party?

605
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:40,679
No, not now, obviously.
But, no. Uh...

606
00:44:40,763 --> 00:44:43,182
I'm only suggesting
that you've, uh...

607
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:48,354
That you've brought life
to a cold house before.

608
00:44:48,437 --> 00:44:50,439
That house was not mine.

609
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:54,234
Neither is this one.
Nothing is ever mine.

610
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:56,945
Not to keep, anyway.

611
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:02,368
Leaving that house
must have been very difficult.

612
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:07,039
A First Lady must always be
ready to pack her suitcases.

613
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:09,750
It's inevitable.

614
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:16,048
We've found beds for
almost all the family.

615
00:45:17,091 --> 00:45:19,051
The Trumans at Blair House.

616
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:22,638
There was a brief crisis about
him not having a driver,

617
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:24,223
but Ike offered his.

618
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:26,558
We're running
a bed-and-breakfast.

619
00:45:29,812 --> 00:45:31,397
Lyndon just wants to
move into the Oval.

620
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,482
He wants to
address Congress.

621
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:35,484
I'll hold him off
as long as I can,

622
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:37,569
but it has to happen
sooner or later.

623
00:45:40,656 --> 00:45:43,325
They're worried
about an outdoor procession.

624
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:45,327
They think
it's a security risk.

625
00:45:45,953 --> 00:45:47,162
Jackie.

626
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:49,915
They think
it's a security risk.

627
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:51,500
Everyone's spooked.

628
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:54,586
Apparently even
State's discouraging

629
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,672
foreign dignitaries
from attending.

630
00:45:57,756 --> 00:46:01,176
It's eight city blocks
to St. Matthew's.

631
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,430
That's a long way to be
strolling through crowds.

632
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:07,266
All those rooftops.
All those windows.

633
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:15,023
Bobby,
it's our last chance.

634
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,651
We have to march with him.

635
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:11,413
It's true, it's true

636
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:14,166
The crown has made it clear

637
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:16,752
The climate must be perfect

638
00:47:17,211 --> 00:47:19,087
All the year

639
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:23,342
A law was made
a distant moon ago here

640
00:47:24,343 --> 00:47:27,387
July and August
cannot be too hot

641
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:32,351
And there's a legal limit
to the snow here

642
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:34,269
In Camelot

643
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:40,609
The winter is forbidden
till December

644
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:44,613
And exits March the second
on the dot

645
00:47:45,447 --> 00:47:49,284
By order, summer lingers
through September

646
00:47:49,785 --> 00:47:51,245
In Camelot

647
00:47:54,206 --> 00:47:57,209
Camelot, Camelot

648
00:47:57,751 --> 00:48:00,379
I know it
sounds a bit bizarre

649
00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:03,632
But in Camelot

650
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,968
Camelot

651
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,804
That's how conditions are

652
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:14,560
The rain may never fall
till after sundown

653
00:48:15,394 --> 00:48:18,313
By 8:00, the morning fog
must disappear

654
00:48:19,565 --> 00:48:23,819
In short, there's simply not
A more congenial spot

655
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:27,489
For happy-ever-aftering

656
00:48:27,573 --> 00:48:32,995
Than here in Camelot

657
00:48:53,515 --> 00:48:56,518
Camelot, Camelot

658
00:48:57,102 --> 00:48:59,521
I know it
gives a person pause

659
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:03,191
But in Camelot

660
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:05,360
Camelot

661
00:49:06,028 --> 00:49:08,363
Those are the legal laws

662
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:13,493
The snow may never slush
upon the hillside

663
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:17,456
By 9:00 p.m.
the moonlight must appear

664
00:49:18,707 --> 00:49:22,628
In short, there's simply not
A more congenial spot

665
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:26,632
For happy-ever-aftering

666
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:32,054
Than here in Camelot

667
00:49:41,355 --> 00:49:42,731
How would you write that?

668
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:45,901
"She lights yet
another cigarette

669
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:49,988
"and explains
through her soft sobs

670
00:49:50,072 --> 00:49:51,323
"that Jack wasn't perfect,

671
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:53,992
"but he was perfect
for our country.

672
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:56,578
"And I ask about his flaws,

673
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:57,893
"and she explains..."

674
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:59,748
Perfect people
can't change.

675
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:02,250
Jack was always
getting better,

676
00:50:02,376 --> 00:50:03,710
stronger.

677
00:50:04,753 --> 00:50:08,256
Sometimes he would
walk into the desert alone,

678
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:11,927
just to let himself
be tempted by the devil.

679
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,514
But he'd always
come back to us,

680
00:50:15,597 --> 00:50:17,099
his beloved family.

681
00:50:22,396 --> 00:50:23,939
And I don't smoke.

682
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:30,362
I shouldn't
say these things.

683
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:35,325
That's why
we're here, isn't it?

684
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:36,785
To talk about
what happened?

685
00:50:38,704 --> 00:50:40,539
Is this a confession?

686
00:50:40,622 --> 00:50:42,791
Only if there's
something you regret.

687
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:45,544
Everyone knows my story.

688
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:48,588
God isn't interested
in stories.

689
00:50:49,798 --> 00:50:52,134
He's interested
in the truth.

690
00:50:53,552 --> 00:50:56,054
I came here looking
for sympathy, Father.

691
00:50:58,181 --> 00:50:59,516
Of course.

692
00:51:01,393 --> 00:51:03,395
Father, are you listening?

693
00:51:04,396 --> 00:51:05,856
I'm listening.

694
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,775
Yes, I think so.

695
00:51:11,653 --> 00:51:13,447
I think God is cruel.

696
00:51:14,948 --> 00:51:17,200
Well, now you're
getting into trouble.

697
00:51:18,577 --> 00:51:19,995
God is love.

698
00:51:23,165 --> 00:51:25,083
And God is everywhere.

699
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:27,586
Was he in the bullet
that killed Jack?

700
00:51:28,962 --> 00:51:30,338
Absolutely.

701
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:32,632
Is he inside me now?

702
00:51:33,258 --> 00:51:35,302
Yes, of course.
Of course he is.

703
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:38,054
Well, that's a funny
game he plays,

704
00:51:38,138 --> 00:51:39,639
hiding all the time.

705
00:51:39,723 --> 00:51:43,185
The fact that we don't understand him
isn't funny at all.

706
00:51:44,436 --> 00:51:46,480
If there's a heaven,
then there's your God,

707
00:51:46,563 --> 00:51:48,690
with all his empty promises.

708
00:51:48,982 --> 00:51:52,360
What kind of God takes a father
from his two little children?

709
00:51:52,444 --> 00:51:54,738
Thy Lord sacrificed
his only son...

710
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:56,531
And my two babies.

711
00:51:56,948 --> 00:51:58,742
Arabella in the womb.

712
00:51:58,825 --> 00:52:01,369
And Patrick.
Thirty-nine hours on Earth.

713
00:52:01,453 --> 00:52:03,914
Just long enough
to fall in love with him.

714
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,042
What did I do
to deserve that?

715
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:08,877
Nothing.

716
00:52:11,087 --> 00:52:14,216
Jack and I hardly ever
spent the night together.

717
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:16,843
Not even that last night
in Fort Worth.

718
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:21,348
Your husband loved you,
Mrs. Kennedy. I'm sure of it.

719
00:52:21,431 --> 00:52:24,601
I seem to remember
there being more to our vows.

720
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:29,898
Don't look at me like that.

721
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:31,775
I was First Lady
of the United States.

722
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:35,111
Women have endured
far worse for far less.

723
00:52:35,862 --> 00:52:37,489
There are two kinds of women.

724
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:39,324
Those who want power
in the world,

725
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:41,910
and those who
want power in bed.

726
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:47,415
Of course,
now what am I left with?

727
00:52:50,043 --> 00:52:53,213
When men see me now,
what do you think they feel?

728
00:52:55,048 --> 00:52:56,299
Sadness.

729
00:52:57,175 --> 00:52:58,552
Compassion.

730
00:53:01,513 --> 00:53:03,181
Desire, maybe.

731
00:53:03,265 --> 00:53:05,892
You're still a young woman,
Mrs. Kennedy.

732
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:09,145
I used to make them smile.

733
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:17,863
No one understands
the pain he was in

734
00:53:17,946 --> 00:53:19,698
and how loyal he was.

735
00:53:19,781 --> 00:53:22,325
Just some of his friends
were so crude.

736
00:53:24,703 --> 00:53:26,121
Jack wasn't, of course.

737
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:28,039
But he could get
caught up in it.

738
00:53:31,543 --> 00:53:33,753
Still, he was
a great father.

739
00:53:34,504 --> 00:53:37,424
I picture him on that
rocking chair in his office,

740
00:53:37,507 --> 00:53:39,801
Caroline and John
at his feet.

741
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,554
How could I hate him?

742
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:47,268
Take comfort
in those memories.

743
00:53:47,684 --> 00:53:49,019
I can't.

744
00:53:49,102 --> 00:53:51,354
They're mixed up
with all the others.

745
00:54:00,906 --> 00:54:03,742
Do you have the latest list
from the State Department?

746
00:54:04,326 --> 00:54:06,828
The dignitaries planning
to attend the funeral.

747
00:54:06,912 --> 00:54:09,581
Oh, yes.
I have it right here.

748
00:54:11,708 --> 00:54:12,751
General de Gaulle.

749
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:14,044
Prince Phillip.

750
00:54:14,127 --> 00:54:16,296
Even the Soviet
Foreign Minister.

751
00:54:16,713 --> 00:54:17,881
More than we were expecting?

752
00:54:17,964 --> 00:54:18,924
Oh, yes.

753
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:20,216
There's dozens of names.

754
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,301
Good.

755
00:54:22,677 --> 00:54:24,012
Will you read them to me?

756
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:25,513
Yes.

757
00:54:26,598 --> 00:54:29,017
Um, from the United Nations,

758
00:54:29,643 --> 00:54:32,771
there's Paul Hoffman,
Managing Director,

759
00:54:33,438 --> 00:54:35,065
David B. Vaughan.

760
00:54:36,566 --> 00:54:38,026
The King of Belgium.

761
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:40,195
Denmark,
the Crown Prince George.

762
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:43,698
Bulgaria, the Deputy
Minister of Foreign Affairs.

763
00:54:43,782 --> 00:54:46,576
Canada, it's the Prime Minister,
Lester B. Pearson.

764
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,620
Austria, the Chancellor.

765
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:50,330
I don't know.

766
00:54:50,413 --> 00:54:52,999
I think you should just
try it without it.

767
00:55:00,382 --> 00:55:04,010
We've been together a long time,
haven't we, Nancy?

768
00:55:04,094 --> 00:55:05,971
Yeah.

769
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:11,059
I used to worry that
you might be jealous of me.

770
00:55:11,142 --> 00:55:12,143
Oh, stop it.

771
00:55:12,227 --> 00:55:15,522
No, you never did anything
to make me feel that way.

772
00:55:16,606 --> 00:55:19,234
But I worried.
After I married Jack.

773
00:55:19,317 --> 00:55:21,361
After he won the election.

774
00:55:22,404 --> 00:55:24,489
Now that seems ridiculous,

775
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:28,493
anyone...
Anyone being jealous of me.

776
00:55:29,452 --> 00:55:31,287
I've buried two children,

777
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:33,498
and now I'm burying
my husband.

778
00:55:39,796 --> 00:55:41,756
You know, I was jealous.

779
00:55:42,841 --> 00:55:44,634
Of that dress
you wore in Vienna.

780
00:55:47,137 --> 00:55:49,917
I know that it's hard
to see it right now,

781
00:55:49,918 --> 00:55:52,600
but you have your whole
life ahead of you.

782
00:55:54,144 --> 00:55:55,895
That's a terrible
thing to say.

783
00:55:55,979 --> 00:55:57,063
You do!

784
00:55:57,147 --> 00:55:59,441
That's a terrible,
terrible thing to say.

785
00:55:59,524 --> 00:56:00,734
But you do.

786
00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:05,321
I'm sorry.

787
00:56:06,281 --> 00:56:07,490
I'm sorry.

788
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:10,952
What will you do now?

789
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:12,620
Oh, I'll stay with you.

790
00:56:13,246 --> 00:56:14,247
You won't go anywhere?

791
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:15,331
No, I'm not
going anywhere.

792
00:56:15,415 --> 00:56:16,750
I don't have
anywhere to go.

793
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:20,670
Those kids are so lucky
to have you.

794
00:56:20,754 --> 00:56:22,797
No, they're
not lucky at all.

795
00:56:22,881 --> 00:56:24,549
They're not lucky.

796
00:56:25,467 --> 00:56:30,138
I'm scared, Nancy,
I'm scared, I'm scared...

797
00:56:30,472 --> 00:56:31,681
I know.

798
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:33,850
I know.

799
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:34,976
At the Capitol,

800
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:38,188
where the President's body will lie in state
throughout the remainder of the day

801
00:56:38,271 --> 00:56:39,939
after it has been removed
from the White House,

802
00:56:40,023 --> 00:56:43,193
there will be
three short speeches or...

803
00:56:43,276 --> 00:56:46,571
She'll be right down.
I'm told any moment.

804
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:48,323
...is allowed to start
viewing the body.

805
00:56:48,406 --> 00:56:50,784
To Dallas, Texas,
and Tom Pettit.

806
00:56:50,867 --> 00:56:52,452
There's the prisoner.

807
00:56:53,036 --> 00:56:54,788
There is Lee Oswald.

808
00:56:57,248 --> 00:56:59,751
He's been shot.
He's been shot.

809
00:57:00,085 --> 00:57:02,087
Lee Oswald has been shot.

810
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:04,547
- There's a man with a gun.
- Jesus Christ.

811
00:57:04,631 --> 00:57:05,757
Are you ready to go?

812
00:57:05,924 --> 00:57:07,050
Yeah.

813
00:57:08,635 --> 00:57:10,220
Will you look at me?

814
00:57:10,929 --> 00:57:12,347
Mommy,
is it my birthday?

815
00:57:12,514 --> 00:57:13,890
Not yet, dear.

816
00:57:13,973 --> 00:57:17,143
But why am I wearing
my party clothes?

817
00:57:22,774 --> 00:57:23,983
Special Agent Hill.

818
00:57:24,067 --> 00:57:25,735
Whenever Mrs. Kennedy
is ready.

819
00:57:26,361 --> 00:57:27,737
Oh, Clint.

820
00:57:31,574 --> 00:57:33,326
We're nearly done here.

821
00:57:37,664 --> 00:57:39,666
It's the strangest thing.

822
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:42,794
I hardly remember
anything after.

823
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:46,673
But I read about
what you did in the papers,

824
00:57:46,756 --> 00:57:48,800
and I just wanted
to thank you.

825
00:57:48,883 --> 00:57:50,260
We got to get a handle
on this thing.

826
00:57:50,343 --> 00:57:52,178
We got to get involved.
Yes, sir.

827
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:56,683
This is making us look like
a bunch of goddamn barbarians.

828
00:57:56,766 --> 00:57:59,811
Mrs. Kennedy is on her
way down with the children.

829
00:58:00,228 --> 00:58:01,855
Turn the television off!

830
00:58:04,691 --> 00:58:06,860
You're not to speak
a word of this.

831
00:58:07,235 --> 00:58:10,613
Understood? I'll tell Jackie
when the time is right.

832
00:58:11,156 --> 00:58:12,323
Sit down.

833
00:58:13,908 --> 00:58:15,243
Excuse me?

834
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:17,036
Sit down.

835
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,455
Darling?

836
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:26,880
What do you remember?
Will you tell me everything?

837
00:58:26,963 --> 00:58:28,256
I need to hear.

838
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:29,883
Mrs. Kennedy...

839
00:58:32,802 --> 00:58:34,762
I was ten yards back
when I heard the first shot.

840
00:58:36,598 --> 00:58:39,100
And as my eyes crossed
the President's car...

841
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,938
Mrs. Kennedy...

842
00:58:45,023 --> 00:58:46,399
Keep going.

843
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:50,862
I had to get to you,
put myself between you,

844
00:58:50,945 --> 00:58:52,989
the President,
and the shooter.

845
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:54,782
Who was it?

846
00:58:55,909 --> 00:58:57,118
Was it that Oswald?

847
00:58:57,285 --> 00:58:58,536
They think so.

848
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,455
I need to talk to him.

849
00:59:01,623 --> 00:59:02,624
Uh...

850
00:59:02,707 --> 00:59:03,791
I need to talk to him.

851
00:59:05,877 --> 00:59:09,547
I don't... I don't know
about that, Mrs. Kennedy.

852
00:59:14,177 --> 00:59:15,428
The children
are ready.

853
00:59:15,511 --> 00:59:17,972
Shall I take them downstairs
to ride with Maud?

854
00:59:18,056 --> 00:59:20,016
I would like them
to come with me.

855
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:21,517
But the press
is out front...

856
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:24,562
Their father is leaving
this house for the last time.

857
00:59:24,646 --> 00:59:26,814
They should be there
to say goodbye to him.

858
00:59:26,898 --> 00:59:28,024
But the cameras.

859
00:59:28,107 --> 00:59:30,985
Those pictures are being broadcast
to every corner of the world.

860
00:59:31,069 --> 00:59:33,696
Those pictures
should record the truth.

861
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,909
Two heartbroken,
fatherless children are part of that.

862
00:59:39,911 --> 00:59:41,913
You can tell them
I'm ready to leave,

863
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:43,248
with Caroline and John.

864
00:59:43,331 --> 00:59:44,624
Yes, Mrs. Kennedy.

865
00:59:44,707 --> 00:59:46,042
Nancy?
Yes?

866
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,461
I'm not
the First Lady anymore.

867
00:59:49,254 --> 00:59:51,047
You can call me Jackie.

868
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:53,299
I will.

869
00:59:57,595 --> 01:00:00,265
Caroline, are you ready,
sweetheart?

870
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:02,517
My brave girl.

871
01:00:05,937 --> 01:00:07,814
Oh, John, John, John.

872
01:00:08,231 --> 01:00:10,108
Let me take you, son.

873
01:00:11,276 --> 01:00:13,111
I value my privacy.

874
01:00:13,194 --> 01:00:14,487
I always have.

875
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,197
And yet,
in the days after,

876
01:00:16,281 --> 01:00:18,700
directly after,
something seemed to change.

877
01:00:18,783 --> 01:00:19,867
In what way?

878
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:21,160
Before the funeral,

879
01:00:21,244 --> 01:00:23,955
the day you moved
the casket to the Capitol,

880
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:27,834
well, your children were on full display
for the whole world to see.

881
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:30,586
Well, what are you insinuating, that I exploited them?

882
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:32,964
Oh, no, of course not.
I just, um...

883
01:00:36,217 --> 01:00:39,053
Present arms!

884
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,668
I'm only wondering if you ever

885
01:01:10,752 --> 01:01:12,837
considered to do more
to shield them.

886
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,423
I think that most people
would have...

887
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:17,675
We aren't most people.

888
01:01:18,509 --> 01:01:20,762
Most people don't have to
make decisions like that,

889
01:01:20,845 --> 01:01:23,139
hours after watching
their husband get murdered

890
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:24,390
next to them.

891
01:01:33,191 --> 01:01:34,567
Oh, Lyndon.

892
01:01:35,193 --> 01:01:38,029
What an awful way
to begin your presidency.

893
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:06,015
Are you saying
it was a mistake?

894
01:02:06,474 --> 01:02:09,310
No, of course not.

895
01:02:32,792 --> 01:02:34,335
How dare you?

896
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:36,754
They murdered him
inside the jail.

897
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:39,507
These people
can get to anyone.

898
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:41,426
How dare you
keep that from me?

899
01:02:41,509 --> 01:02:42,927
You had no right!
The children?

900
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:44,095
The ceremony
at the Capitol...

901
01:02:44,178 --> 01:02:45,221
I took them
out the front door.

902
01:02:45,304 --> 01:02:46,681
Are you...
This is all insanity!

903
01:02:46,764 --> 01:02:47,765
You and your brother.

904
01:02:47,849 --> 01:02:49,600
All these years,
all your goddamn secrets!

905
01:02:49,725 --> 01:02:51,978
That's not fair... Caroline
and John are all I have left,

906
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:54,397
and I put them in danger
because of you.

907
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,315
I would never
put you at risk.

908
01:02:56,399 --> 01:02:57,900
You can't know that!

909
01:02:57,984 --> 01:03:00,153
You think you all
control everything,

910
01:03:00,236 --> 01:03:02,780
that you have the world
on puppet strings.

911
01:03:02,864 --> 01:03:06,200
And you're ridiculous.
And I let myself believe it.

912
01:03:07,368 --> 01:03:09,370
And this parade?
Who is it really for?

913
01:03:09,454 --> 01:03:10,580
For Jack?

914
01:03:10,663 --> 01:03:13,708
One more campaign stop
along the way to the grave?

915
01:03:14,417 --> 01:03:16,377
Lyndon's people are right.

916
01:03:16,461 --> 01:03:17,545
It's not worth it.

917
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:19,255
It's not worth
risking people's lives.

918
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:21,299
You tell them
we're calling it off.

919
01:03:21,382 --> 01:03:22,925
We'll motorcade
to the Cathedral.

920
01:03:23,009 --> 01:03:24,010
The back way.

921
01:03:24,093 --> 01:03:26,512
And then we'll bury him,
and we put an end to all this.

922
01:03:26,596 --> 01:03:28,389
I don't give
a damn anymore.

923
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:30,183
I don't.

924
01:03:31,058 --> 01:03:32,685
I would never put you
and the children in danger.

925
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:35,396
I know you think I'm some
silly little debutante.

926
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:37,315
Listen to me. You don't
protect me anymore.

927
01:03:37,398 --> 01:03:39,984
I would never put you
and the children in danger.

928
01:03:40,818 --> 01:03:42,612
You don't know anything.

929
01:03:49,577 --> 01:03:53,539
I lie awake at night,
and all I can think is

930
01:03:54,415 --> 01:03:56,167
I should have been
a shop girl

931
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,585
or a stenographer.

932
01:03:57,668 --> 01:04:02,590
I should have married
an ordinary, lazy, ugly man.

933
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:12,934
Let me share
with you a parable.

934
01:04:16,187 --> 01:04:22,318
Jesus once passed a blind
beggar on the road,

935
01:04:22,985 --> 01:04:26,072
and his disciples asked,
"Who sinned,

936
01:04:26,614 --> 01:04:29,825
"this man or his parents,
that he should be born blind?"

937
01:04:29,909 --> 01:04:32,078
And Jesus said,

938
01:04:32,161 --> 01:04:35,414
"Neither this man
nor his parents sinned.

939
01:04:36,832 --> 01:04:38,417
"He was made blind

940
01:04:38,501 --> 01:04:41,504
"so that the works of God
could be revealed in him."

941
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:45,341
And with that,
he placed mud on his eyes

942
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:48,928
and told him to wash
in the Pool of Siloam.

943
01:04:51,556 --> 01:04:54,767
And the man did,
and he came back seeing.

944
01:04:56,978 --> 01:04:58,729
Right now you are blind.

945
01:04:58,813 --> 01:05:00,064
Not because you've sinned,

946
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:02,233
but because
you've been chosen.

947
01:05:03,985 --> 01:05:07,488
So that the works of God
can be revealed in you.

948
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:17,081
It's perfect.

949
01:05:17,748 --> 01:05:19,709
We installed it
while you were away.

950
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:21,419
I thought
it'd be a nice surprise

951
01:05:21,502 --> 01:05:22,587
for you and the President.

952
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:24,088
It changes everything.

953
01:05:25,464 --> 01:05:26,799
And the Treaty Room?

954
01:05:26,966 --> 01:05:28,301
Hunter green.

955
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:30,928
Exactly as you imagined it.

956
01:05:32,054 --> 01:05:33,556
I wish Jack...

957
01:05:35,266 --> 01:05:37,435
Who knows
if he would have cared?

958
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:41,731
I lost track, somewhere...

959
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:45,192
What was real.

960
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:48,654
What was performance.

961
01:05:49,322 --> 01:05:51,574
Well, he was a president.

962
01:05:52,366 --> 01:05:53,909
You were right earlier.

963
01:05:53,993 --> 01:05:56,621
I'm not going to march tomorrow.

964
01:05:58,247 --> 01:05:59,679
I won't put people in danger

965
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,083
on account of my vanity.

966
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:04,837
I was scared for you.
I still am.

967
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,339
But I never thought
it was vanity.

968
01:06:06,422 --> 01:06:08,591
You know, that's what
Jack called all this.

969
01:06:09,216 --> 01:06:11,802
When he saw what we
were spending, he said,

970
01:06:14,472 --> 01:06:16,098
"Your little vanity project

971
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:19,101
"is going to bankrupt
the federal government."

972
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:23,898
People need their history.

973
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:25,358
It gives them strength.

974
01:06:26,776 --> 01:06:30,446
They need to know that
real men actually lived here.

975
01:06:31,072 --> 01:06:33,282
Not ghosts
and storybook legends,

976
01:06:33,908 --> 01:06:37,244
people who faced adversity
and overcame it.

977
01:06:39,288 --> 01:06:41,666
What you've done
in this house matters.

978
01:06:41,749 --> 01:06:43,751
That's kind of you, Bill.

979
01:06:44,794 --> 01:06:47,004
Even I'm starting
to lose him.

980
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:51,258
Pretty soon

981
01:06:52,426 --> 01:06:54,470
he'll just be
another oil portrait

982
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:56,430
lining these hallways.

983
01:07:08,109 --> 01:07:12,279
Happy birthday to you

984
01:07:13,114 --> 01:07:17,576
Happy birthday to you

985
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:21,664
Happy birthday, dear John

986
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,402
I spoke to Johnson.

987
01:07:53,154 --> 01:07:54,655
Tomorrow...

988
01:07:56,073 --> 01:07:57,450
It's being handled.

989
01:07:57,908 --> 01:07:59,660
Everyone will ride.

990
01:08:00,745 --> 01:08:02,246
No procession.

991
01:08:05,166 --> 01:08:06,792
I'm sorry, Bobby.

992
01:08:13,382 --> 01:08:15,801
Do you think
Lincoln's widow knew?

993
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:18,679
What?

994
01:08:18,763 --> 01:08:21,348
That we'd build a monument
to her husband?

995
01:08:24,185 --> 01:08:27,146
Why is this room
so peaceful?

996
01:08:27,229 --> 01:08:29,190
"Peaceful"? I don't know.

997
01:08:31,525 --> 01:08:32,943
Every time I walk
by this room,

998
01:08:33,027 --> 01:08:36,822
I'm reminded that
on January 1st, 1863,

999
01:08:36,906 --> 01:08:40,284
an ordinary man
signed a document

1000
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:43,037
that freed four million people
from slavery.

1001
01:08:44,413 --> 01:08:45,873
So,

1002
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,628
I don't think of it
so much as peaceful

1003
01:08:52,046 --> 01:08:55,049
as a place
of profound legacy.

1004
01:08:57,092 --> 01:09:00,304
And it's too bad that ours
is totally fucking wasted.

1005
01:09:00,387 --> 01:09:01,680
Bobby!

1006
01:09:02,556 --> 01:09:03,557
What?

1007
01:09:04,725 --> 01:09:06,727
Bobby, watch your mouth.

1008
01:09:06,811 --> 01:09:09,438
What did we accomplish, huh?

1009
01:09:10,356 --> 01:09:13,150
We're just... We're just
the beautiful people?

1010
01:09:13,234 --> 01:09:14,693
Right? Isn't that
what we are?

1011
01:09:14,777 --> 01:09:16,237
Bobby.
Because what did we...

1012
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,864
What did we truly accomplish?

1013
01:09:20,241 --> 01:09:21,408
Maybe Jack will be remembered

1014
01:09:21,492 --> 01:09:22,785
for the way he handled
the missile crisis,

1015
01:09:22,868 --> 01:09:24,286
or maybe he'll be remembered

1016
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:25,746
for having created a crisis

1017
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:27,706
that he was then
forced to solve.

1018
01:09:35,589 --> 01:09:37,716
We could have
done so much.

1019
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:40,928
Civil rights,
the space program.

1020
01:09:42,054 --> 01:09:44,974
Vietnam. Now, Johnson
gets to handle Vietnam.

1021
01:09:45,057 --> 01:09:46,892
We teed it up for him.

1022
01:09:46,976 --> 01:09:48,978
He gets to knock it down.

1023
01:09:51,188 --> 01:09:54,108
I shouldn't have pushed him
so hard on Castro.

1024
01:09:54,191 --> 01:09:56,402
You can't
do that, Bobby.

1025
01:09:58,612 --> 01:10:00,531
What's wrong with you?

1026
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:05,286
What's wrong with me?

1027
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:10,040
History is harsh.

1028
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,630
There's no time.

1029
01:10:18,632 --> 01:10:20,593
We're ridiculous.
Look at you.

1030
01:10:25,389 --> 01:10:26,724
I'm sorry.

1031
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:16,583
How do you like
your new office?

1032
01:12:16,834 --> 01:12:18,252
Mrs. Kennedy.

1033
01:12:19,253 --> 01:12:20,462
Come in.

1034
01:12:21,088 --> 01:12:22,715
Sorry, I'm just
doing my job, ma'am.

1035
01:12:22,798 --> 01:12:24,508
Of course you are.

1036
01:12:24,591 --> 01:12:27,136
I remember
when we won the election.

1037
01:12:27,261 --> 01:12:28,512
It was so overwhelming.

1038
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:29,680
We're doing just fine.

1039
01:12:29,763 --> 01:12:31,515
Everyone's thoughts
are with you right now.

1040
01:12:31,598 --> 01:12:33,767
Oh, that's
very kind of you.

1041
01:12:35,477 --> 01:12:37,688
I've come
to discuss tomorrow.

1042
01:12:38,272 --> 01:12:39,667
The Attorney General
relayed to me your desire

1043
01:12:39,668 --> 01:12:41,683
for a more modest ceremony.

1044
01:12:41,684 --> 01:12:42,943
I've changed my mind.

1045
01:12:43,944 --> 01:12:45,195
I'm sorry?

1046
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:46,864
I said I've changed my mind.

1047
01:12:46,947 --> 01:12:48,449
We will have a procession,

1048
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:50,034
and I will walk
to the Cathedral

1049
01:12:50,117 --> 01:12:51,535
with the casket.

1050
01:12:52,953 --> 01:12:56,290
Well, even if we could resume
the arrangements,

1051
01:12:56,373 --> 01:12:57,458
I'm sure you can understand

1052
01:12:57,541 --> 01:12:59,585
the Secret Service
still has their concerns.

1053
01:12:59,668 --> 01:13:01,211
And President Johnson?

1054
01:13:01,295 --> 01:13:02,546
President Johnson
would like nothing more

1055
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:03,672
than to fulfill your wishes,

1056
01:13:03,797 --> 01:13:06,050
but I have to take
into account his safety.

1057
01:13:06,133 --> 01:13:09,470
The country couldn't endure another blow
should anything...

1058
01:13:12,139 --> 01:13:13,474
It's not the same.

1059
01:13:13,557 --> 01:13:14,767
If it were up to him,

1060
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:17,061
he'd do anything that
might bring you comfort.

1061
01:13:17,644 --> 01:13:20,272
Then who is it up to,
Mr. Valenti?

1062
01:13:20,355 --> 01:13:21,482
Well, as I'm sure
you know,

1063
01:13:21,565 --> 01:13:24,026
tomorrow we're expecting
close to 100 Heads of State.

1064
01:13:24,151 --> 01:13:25,861
One-hundred three.

1065
01:13:25,986 --> 01:13:27,237
Yes, I'm sure that's right.

1066
01:13:27,321 --> 01:13:30,574
And I suspect they'll make
all their own decisions.

1067
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:32,493
Based on what?

1068
01:13:33,827 --> 01:13:35,954
There's a great deal
of classified intelligence

1069
01:13:36,038 --> 01:13:37,998
that I just can't get into.

1070
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:41,794
We've intercepted a threat
against General de Gaulle

1071
01:13:41,877 --> 01:13:43,712
from our assets in Geneva.

1072
01:13:44,004 --> 01:13:47,091
I'm afraid if he refuses
to march, others may follow.

1073
01:13:49,384 --> 01:13:51,011
I understand.

1074
01:13:51,095 --> 01:13:52,429
As I said, Mrs. Kennedy,

1075
01:13:52,513 --> 01:13:53,514
I wish there were
more we could do

1076
01:13:53,597 --> 01:13:55,099
to accommodate
your wishes.

1077
01:13:55,182 --> 01:13:56,391
I'm terribly sorry.

1078
01:13:56,517 --> 01:13:57,768
Don't be.

1079
01:13:57,851 --> 01:14:00,062
You and the Johnsons
have already done so much.

1080
01:14:00,187 --> 01:14:01,396
Good day, Mrs. Kennedy.

1081
01:14:01,522 --> 01:14:02,940
Um, Mr. Valenti.

1082
01:14:03,023 --> 01:14:05,960
Would you mind
getting a message

1083
01:14:05,961 --> 01:14:07,236
to all our funeral guests
when they land?

1084
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:08,862
Of course.

1085
01:14:08,946 --> 01:14:12,116
Inform them that I will walk
with Jack tomorrow.

1086
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:14,701
Alone, if necessary.

1087
01:14:15,786 --> 01:14:17,913
And tell General de Gaulle

1088
01:14:18,038 --> 01:14:20,541
that if he wishes to ride
in an armored car

1089
01:14:20,624 --> 01:14:22,417
or in a tank
for that matter,

1090
01:14:22,876 --> 01:14:24,086
I won't blame him.

1091
01:14:24,878 --> 01:14:27,047
And I'm sure
the tens of millions of people

1092
01:14:27,131 --> 01:14:28,757
watching won't either.

1093
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:32,386
Why are you doing this,
Mrs. Kennedy?

1094
01:14:32,469 --> 01:14:34,555
Oh, I'm just doing my job.

1095
01:14:43,397 --> 01:14:45,732
Would you like
to write this down?

1096
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,152
Do you think I should?
I...

1097
01:14:48,235 --> 01:14:49,570
I do.

1098
01:14:56,618 --> 01:14:59,997
We all live on
far after our deaths.

1099
01:15:01,582 --> 01:15:04,084
Presidents will
come and go,

1100
01:15:05,252 --> 01:15:07,045
and every one of them

1101
01:15:07,129 --> 01:15:11,758
will look up to Jack
for guidance, for inspiration.

1102
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:17,806
What do you say to those
who say he didn't deserve it?

1103
01:15:18,432 --> 01:15:21,225
The scale of it. I mean,
he was a great president,

1104
01:15:21,226 --> 01:15:23,854
but he didn't win
the Civil War, for instance.

1105
01:15:24,813 --> 01:15:27,983
It was a funeral for
the President of the United States.

1106
01:15:28,609 --> 01:15:31,236
Your husband drove cars,
he didn't ride horses.

1107
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,051
Yes, and there should
have been more of them.

1108
01:15:33,052 --> 01:15:35,745
There should
be more horses,

1109
01:15:35,745 --> 01:15:37,784
more soldiers,
more crying, more cameras!

1110
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:48,212
I'm guessing you won't
allow me to write any of that.

1111
01:15:49,463 --> 01:15:50,631
No,

1112
01:15:51,465 --> 01:15:53,217
because I never said that.

1113
01:15:56,803 --> 01:16:00,974
Perhaps Jack didn't have time
to defeat Communism,

1114
01:16:02,226 --> 01:16:03,810
but I do seem to recall...

1115
01:16:03,894 --> 01:16:05,395
With all due respect,

1116
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:07,856
you were at the center
of it all, Mrs. Kennedy,

1117
01:16:08,232 --> 01:16:13,153
and I'd imagine it's impossible
to have any perspective from that vantage point.

1118
01:16:13,237 --> 01:16:17,157
But I can assure you that
it was a spectacle.

1119
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:32,441
Nancy said
they wanted to share my grief,

1120
01:17:32,566 --> 01:17:33,817
so I let them.

1121
01:17:34,609 --> 01:17:38,947
But after, I realized
that all the pageantry,

1122
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:42,617
all the demands
I made to honor him,

1123
01:17:43,243 --> 01:17:46,413
it wasn't for Jack
or his legacy.

1124
01:17:48,332 --> 01:17:49,833
It was for me.

1125
01:18:49,810 --> 01:18:51,478
I wrote him a letter.

1126
01:18:52,354 --> 01:18:55,941
That night, before we moved
the casket to the Capitol.

1127
01:18:56,024 --> 01:18:57,692
Do you know what I wrote?

1128
01:18:58,485 --> 01:18:59,986
That I wanted to die.

1129
01:19:00,654 --> 01:19:02,197
I understand.
Do you?

1130
01:19:02,322 --> 01:19:03,407
I do.

1131
01:19:04,408 --> 01:19:08,036
Unless you are
asking my permission.

1132
01:19:08,161 --> 01:19:12,165
No, only crass, self-indulgent people
kill themselves.

1133
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:14,239
No, I was just hoping
that if I walked

1134
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:17,064
down the street
next to Jack's body,

1135
01:19:17,065 --> 01:19:20,070
maybe someone would be
kind enough to do it for me.

1136
01:19:20,093 --> 01:19:21,883
In front of
the whole world?

1137
01:19:22,509 --> 01:19:25,137
Famous life, famous death.

1138
01:19:25,887 --> 01:19:27,681
I never wanted fame.

1139
01:19:28,265 --> 01:19:30,058
I just became a Kennedy.

1140
01:20:04,384 --> 01:20:09,181
I told everyone
that I can't remember.

1141
01:20:09,264 --> 01:20:10,599
It's not true.

1142
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:13,018
I can remember.

1143
01:20:13,101 --> 01:20:14,478
I can remember everything.

1144
01:20:19,816 --> 01:20:21,902
The first bullet. Boom.

1145
01:20:22,235 --> 01:20:24,446
Then boom.

1146
01:20:28,575 --> 01:20:29,993
I could have saved him.

1147
01:20:35,582 --> 01:20:37,083
I should have known
it was a gunshot.

1148
01:20:37,167 --> 01:20:39,085
I should have shielded him.

1149
01:20:40,712 --> 01:20:42,005
I tried to stop the bleeding,

1150
01:20:42,088 --> 01:20:43,590
but when we got
to the hospital, it was...

1151
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,507
That night,
and every night since,

1152
01:21:25,632 --> 01:21:27,133
I pray to die.

1153
01:21:28,969 --> 01:21:31,763
Won't God let me be
with my husband?

1154
01:22:37,537 --> 01:22:38,830
Can I look?

1155
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:44,461
It's just the...
It hasn't...

1156
01:22:44,544 --> 01:22:46,755
You don't write
very legibly, do you?

1157
01:23:07,233 --> 01:23:09,486
You left your mark on this
country, Mrs. Kennedy.

1158
01:23:09,569 --> 01:23:12,238
These past few days,
that's the story.

1159
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,910
Losing a president is like...
It's like losing a father.

1160
01:23:16,993 --> 01:23:18,370
And you were a mother
to all of us,

1161
01:23:18,453 --> 01:23:20,080
and that's
a very good story.

1162
01:23:23,083 --> 01:23:25,627
The entire country
watched the funeral

1163
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:28,672
from beginning to end.

1164
01:23:29,089 --> 01:23:30,840
Decades from now,

1165
01:23:33,301 --> 01:23:37,847
people will remember
your dignity and the majesty.

1166
01:23:38,348 --> 01:23:40,058
They'll remember you.

1167
01:23:40,392 --> 01:23:42,477
It will serve
a definite purpose.

1168
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,522
My husband has
so many meetings up here,

1169
01:23:45,605 --> 01:23:46,648
in this part of the house.

1170
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:49,984
All the men who wait to
see him now sit in the hall,

1171
01:23:50,068 --> 01:23:52,612
with baby carriages
going by them.

1172
01:23:52,696 --> 01:23:54,489
So they can sit in here

1173
01:23:54,572 --> 01:23:57,617
and have a conference around
this table, waiting for him.

1174
01:23:59,077 --> 01:24:00,787
Well,
he's going to come in, uh...

1175
01:24:01,413 --> 01:24:02,914
Mr. President.

1176
01:24:03,998 --> 01:24:05,041
Well, Mrs., uh...

1177
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:06,251
Mr. Collingwood.

1178
01:24:06,334 --> 01:24:08,586
Mrs. Kennedy
has been showing us

1179
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:09,879
about the White House

1180
01:24:09,963 --> 01:24:13,591
and all the changes
that she's made therein.

1181
01:24:13,675 --> 01:24:16,386
What do you think of
the changes that she's made?

1182
01:24:16,469 --> 01:24:20,348
Well, I think the great effort
that she's made has been to, uh,

1183
01:24:20,432 --> 01:24:22,642
bring us much more
intimately in contact

1184
01:24:22,726 --> 01:24:24,269
with all the men
who lived here.

1185
01:24:24,352 --> 01:24:26,865
Of course,
I think anyone who comes

1186
01:24:26,866 --> 01:24:27,794
to the White House as a President, uh,

1187
01:24:27,795 --> 01:24:29,899
desires the best
for his country.

1188
01:24:29,983 --> 01:24:34,571
But I think he does receive
a stimulus from the knowledge

1189
01:24:34,654 --> 01:24:40,623
of living in close proximity
to the people who are legendary,

1190
01:24:40,624 --> 01:24:44,640
but who actually were alive
and were in these rooms.

1191
01:25:00,889 --> 01:25:01,931
Thank you.

1192
01:25:02,265 --> 01:25:04,058
Everything will be
held in storage

1193
01:25:04,142 --> 01:25:06,102
until you decide
where to settle.

1194
01:25:38,343 --> 01:25:40,178
There's one last thing.

1195
01:25:40,261 --> 01:25:42,555
It's more important
than all the rest.

1196
01:25:43,431 --> 01:25:45,558
You know,
every night before bed,

1197
01:25:45,642 --> 01:25:47,352
we had this old Victrola.

1198
01:25:48,102 --> 01:25:50,021
We'd listen
to a couple records.

1199
01:25:50,104 --> 01:25:52,482
His favorite was Camelot.

1200
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:53,733
The musical?

1201
01:25:53,817 --> 01:25:55,527
Oh, I'm so
ashamed of myself.

1202
01:25:55,610 --> 01:25:57,362
Every quote
out of Jack's mouth

1203
01:25:57,445 --> 01:25:59,531
was either Greek or Roman.

1204
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:03,743
And that last song,
that last side of Camelot,

1205
01:26:03,827 --> 01:26:06,412
is all that keeps running
through my mind.

1206
01:26:08,873 --> 01:26:11,000
"Don't let it be forgot,

1207
01:26:11,835 --> 01:26:15,694
"that for one brief,

1208
01:26:16,199 --> 01:26:17,674
"shining moment
there was a Camelot."

1209
01:26:22,345 --> 01:26:23,721
Jack loved history.

1210
01:26:23,805 --> 01:26:25,348
It's what made him
what he was.

1211
01:26:25,431 --> 01:26:26,933
Just imagine,
he was a little boy

1212
01:26:27,016 --> 01:26:28,476
with scarlet fever in bed,

1213
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,019
reading history.

1214
01:26:30,103 --> 01:26:32,856
King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.

1215
01:26:32,939 --> 01:26:34,649
That's what Camelot is about.

1216
01:26:34,732 --> 01:26:37,108
Ordinary men banding together

1217
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:38,570
to fight for a better world.

1218
01:26:40,363 --> 01:26:42,282
Don't misunderstand me.

1219
01:26:42,365 --> 01:26:44,033
Jack wasn't naive.

1220
01:26:44,868 --> 01:26:46,494
But he had ideals.

1221
01:26:46,619 --> 01:26:49,539
Ideals he could rally
others to believe in.

1222
01:26:51,165 --> 01:26:53,376
Will those ideals
live on?

1223
01:26:54,586 --> 01:26:56,045
Sure they will.

1224
01:26:56,129 --> 01:26:58,381
Of course, there will
be great progress.

1225
01:26:58,464 --> 01:27:00,425
There will be
other great presidents.

1226
01:27:00,508 --> 01:27:03,344
The Johnsons have been
so generous to me.

1227
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:08,016
But there won't be
another Camelot.

1228
01:27:09,642 --> 01:27:11,436
Not another Camelot.

1229
01:27:13,479 --> 01:27:15,440
Why are you really here?

1230
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:17,233
'Cause I needed to talk.

1231
01:27:17,317 --> 01:27:19,861
You say that you pray
every night to die.

1232
01:27:20,653 --> 01:27:22,697
That your children have no use for you.

1233
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:24,824
You wish only to be with your husband.

1234
01:27:24,908 --> 01:27:27,493
And yet, I'm not burying you today.

1235
01:27:29,787 --> 01:27:36,686
There comes a time in man's search for meaning,
when one realizes

1236
01:27:37,211 --> 01:27:39,339
that there are no answers.

1237
01:27:39,505 --> 01:27:44,677
And when you come to that horrible,
unavoidable realization,

1238
01:27:45,428 --> 01:27:47,555
you accept it
or you kill yourself.

1239
01:27:48,598 --> 01:27:52,435
Or you simply stop searching.

1240
01:27:54,687 --> 01:27:58,733
I have lived
a blessed life.

1241
01:27:59,776 --> 01:28:03,237
And yet, every night,
when I climb into bed,

1242
01:28:03,321 --> 01:28:08,117
turn off the lights,
and stare into the dark,

1243
01:28:09,827 --> 01:28:11,287
I wonder...

1244
01:28:11,913 --> 01:28:14,207
Is this all there is?

1245
01:28:14,791 --> 01:28:16,501
You wonder?

1246
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,420
Every soul
on this planet does.

1247
01:28:20,338 --> 01:28:21,631
But then,
when morning comes,

1248
01:28:21,714 --> 01:28:24,300
we all wake up
and make a pot of coffee.

1249
01:28:24,384 --> 01:28:25,802
Why do we bother?

1250
01:28:25,969 --> 01:28:27,387
Because we do.

1251
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:30,640
You did this morning.
You will again tomorrow.

1252
01:28:31,474 --> 01:28:35,061
But God,
in his infinite wisdom,

1253
01:28:35,144 --> 01:28:36,771
has made sure

1254
01:28:38,523 --> 01:28:40,692
it is just enough for us.

1255
01:28:48,032 --> 01:28:51,452
Once more. Mrs. Kennedy
has expressed her desire

1256
01:28:51,536 --> 01:28:55,415
to re-inter the bodies
of the two children they lost

1257
01:28:55,498 --> 01:28:57,792
to rest alongside
their father.

1258
01:28:57,875 --> 01:28:59,544
You got that part, right?

1259
01:28:59,836 --> 01:29:02,839
She wants them
to always remember,

1260
01:29:02,922 --> 01:29:05,550
for one brief,
shining moment,

1261
01:29:06,551 --> 01:29:08,803
there was a...

1262
01:29:08,886 --> 01:29:11,139
Yeah, Camelot. Yeah.

1263
01:29:21,065 --> 01:29:23,693
I hope you have a good night,
Mrs. Kennedy.

1264
01:29:26,779 --> 01:29:28,906
He wrote down every word.

1265
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:30,616
Did it help heal you?

1266
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:33,161
It's been reprinted
all over the world.

1267
01:29:33,244 --> 01:29:36,497
Maybe that's what they'll
all believe now. Camelot.

1268
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:39,751
People like to believe
in fairy tales.

1269
01:29:39,834 --> 01:29:41,044
And you?

1270
01:29:41,711 --> 01:29:44,297
Do you believe
you did him justice?

1271
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:46,966
I believe that the characters
we read about on the page

1272
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:50,720
end up being more real than
the men who stand beside us.

1273
01:29:52,388 --> 01:29:53,848
I should have guessed

1274
01:29:53,931 --> 01:29:56,267
it was too much to ask
that we grow old together,

1275
01:29:56,768 --> 01:29:58,770
see our children
grow up.

1276
01:30:00,146 --> 01:30:02,440
The darkness
may never go away,

1277
01:30:03,441 --> 01:30:05,902
but it won't always
be this heavy.

1278
01:30:07,195 --> 01:30:08,362
Come.

1279
01:30:09,405 --> 01:30:11,449
They're waiting for us
at Arlington.

1280
01:30:18,706 --> 01:30:20,500
In the name of the Father,

1281
01:30:20,583 --> 01:30:23,127
the Son,
and the Holy Spirit...

1282
01:30:30,384 --> 01:30:31,969
In the name of the Father,

1283
01:30:32,053 --> 01:30:35,348
the Son,
and the Holy Spirit...

1284
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:07,630
Each evening,
from December to December

1285
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:12,552
Before you drift
to sleep upon your cot

1286
01:31:14,554 --> 01:31:18,349
Think back on all the tales
that you remember

1287
01:31:20,059 --> 01:31:21,894
Of Camelot

1288
01:31:25,273 --> 01:31:29,110
Ask every person
if he's heard the story

1289
01:31:30,570 --> 01:31:32,071
And tell it strong...

1290
01:31:32,155 --> 01:31:36,993
I was just so happy
that he could be proud.

1291
01:31:37,076 --> 01:31:39,620
Because then
I was having a baby,

1292
01:31:39,704 --> 01:31:40,746
and I couldn't campaign,

1293
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:42,748
and then we got
in the White House,

1294
01:31:42,832 --> 01:31:45,585
and all of the things
I'd always done,

1295
01:31:45,668 --> 01:31:48,588
suddenly they
became wonderful.

1296
01:31:48,671 --> 01:31:50,923
Because anything
the First Lady does

1297
01:31:51,007 --> 01:31:53,759
that is different
everyone seizes on.

1298
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:56,345
And I was just
so happy for Jack

1299
01:31:56,429 --> 01:31:58,973
that he could be proud of me.

1300
01:32:00,099 --> 01:32:02,310
Those were our happiest years.

1301
01:32:06,856 --> 01:32:10,943
Where once it never
rained till after sundown

1302
01:32:12,361 --> 01:32:16,782
By 8:00 a.m.,
the morning fog had flown

1303
01:32:17,992 --> 01:32:20,328
Don't let it be forgot

1304
01:32:20,912 --> 01:32:23,414
That once there was a spot

1305
01:32:23,915 --> 01:32:27,126
For one brief,
shining moment

1306
01:32:28,502 --> 01:32:32,048
That was known

1307
01:32:32,131 --> 01:32:38,804
As Camelot
