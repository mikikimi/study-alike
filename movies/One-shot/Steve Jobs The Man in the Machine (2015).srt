1
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,396
After hours of getting
this thing right...

2
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,824
God, look at that.
Look, I'm on television.

3
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,536
- Hey! Isn't that amazing?
- Yeah, it is.

4
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,701
- You're on TV in New York, too.
- What's that?

5
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,368
- You're on TV in New York, too.
- No, no.

6
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,751
- Yes, you are.
- Am I really? Are you serious?

7
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,120
- Yeah, they got you in New York.
- God.

8
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,296
I'm gonna let you
put it in your own ear.

9
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,635
- Really?
- It's a talk back.

10
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:58,552
- They're going to talk to you.
- This is not the real thing, right?

11
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,016
You just want a picture of me now?

12
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,893
- They're going to sit you here first.
- God.

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,732
You need to tell me
where the restroom is, too,

14
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,146
cos I'm deathly ill, actually,

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,902
and ready to throw up
at any moment, so...

16
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,365
- It's right across the hall.
- Great. I'm not joking.

17
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,619
We're ready to go, gentlemen.
New York's waiting for a shot of him.

18
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:02,454
If you see in my eyes,
I've been crying just a little bit.

19
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,619
And it seems really ridiculous
because I've never met the man.

20
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:11,543
I know life is ephemeral,
but I just, you know,

21
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,586
I expected him to be around
a little longer.

22
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,005
Pretty sure everybody did,
but, you know...

23
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:21,131
The thing I'm using right now,
an iMac, he made.

24
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:25,010
He made the iMac.
He made the Macbook.

25
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,388
He made the Macbook Pro.
He made the Macbook Air.

26
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:32,187
He made the iPhone.
He made the iPod.

27
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:38,774
Yeah, he's made the iPod Touch.
He's made everything.

28
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:49,535
<i>♪ Hey, Mr Tambourine Man

00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:54,672

32
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:12,061
It's not often that the whole
planet seems to feel a loss together,

33
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,058
but after the death of Steve Jobs,

34
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,153
co-founder of Apple
and singular dreamer,

35
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,364
all day, we watched
as there was a kind of global wake.

36
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:24,532
<i>On Facebook, millions changing
their profiles to the Apple logo.</i>

37
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:28,156
<i>A kind of black armband,
a gesture of gratitude.</i>

38
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,540
<i>We've been monitoring
the hashtag "thankyousteve."</i>

39
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,378
<i>My favorite tweet last night</i>

40
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:39,175
<i>was four simple letters
simply saying, "iSad."</i>

41
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,852
Hi.

42
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:01,152
<i>When Steve Jobs died,
I was mystified.</i>

43
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:05,072
<i>What accounted for the grief of
millions of people who didn't know him?</i>

44
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,571
<i>I'd seen it with John Lennon
and Martin Luther king,</i>

45
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:12,291
<i>but Steve Jobs wasn't a singer
or a civil-rights leader.</i>

46
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,667
Many commentators were surprised

47
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,884
by the intensity and the power
of this wave of emotion.

48
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:27,007
What was it?
And I think it was truly love.

49
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:33,184
Jobs has proven to be the one
and only person in the world

50
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:38,606
who can create
technology products that people love.

51
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,901
Wall-E.

52
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:47,198
<i>I love "Wall-E,"
a film Jobs's Pixar produced,</i>

53
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,537
<i>and I love my iPhone,</i>

54
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:54,038
<i>but the grief for Jobs seemed to go
beyond the products he left behind.</i>

55
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,583
<i>We mourned the man himself,
but why?</i>

56
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:01,879
<i>Behind the scenes, Jobs could be
ruthless, deceitful and cruel.</i>

57
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:07,301
<i>Yet he won our hearts by convincing us
that Apple represented a higher ideal.</i>

58
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:11,676
<i>It was not like other companies.
It was different.</i>

59
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,600
Good morning and welcome to Apple's
1984 annual shareholders' meeting.

60
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,148
I'd like to open the meeting
with part of an old poem,

61
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,443
about a 20-year-old poem, by Dylan.
That's Bob Dylan.

62
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,702
"Come writers and critics
who prophesize with your pens

63
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,413
and keep your eyes wide,
the chance won't come again."

64
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,290
"And don't speak too soon
for the wheel's still in spin

65
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,827
and there's no telling
who that it's naming."

66
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:42,708
"For the loser now will be later to win,
for the times, they are a-changing."

67
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:46,840
<i>Jobs loved Dylan
maybe because he wasn’t just one thing.</i>

68
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:51,428
<i>He was a storyteller who could
be whatever we wanted him to be.</i>

69
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,978
I don't even what know what
<i>All Along The Watchtower</i> means.

70
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,393
I think it is one of
the most beautiful, haunting,

71
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:04,317
brilliant pieces of poetry ever.
And to me, it's like Steve.

72
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,109
"There must be some way
out of here, said the..."

73
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,244
What is it?

74
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,903
<i>Said the Joker to the Thief.</i>

75
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,613
He's both.

76
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,923
<i>♪ "There must be
Some way out of here"</i>

77
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,015
<i>♪ Said the joker to the thief</i>

78
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,559
<i>♪ There's too much confusion</i>

79
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,564
<i>♪ I can't get no relief</i>

80
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,651
<i>♪ Businessmen, they drink my wine</i>

81
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,193
<i>♪ Plowmen dig my earth</i>

82
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,363
<i>♪ None of them along the line</i>

83
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,658
<i>♪ Know what any of it is worth</i>

84
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,030
<i>There's something going on
here in life</i>

85
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,997
<i>beyond just a job and a family
and career.</i>

86
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,867
<i>There's another side of the coin.</i>

87
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,705
<i>It's the same thing</i>

88
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:50,217
<i>that causes people to want to be poets
instead of bankers.</i>

89
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:57,301
<i>And I think that that same spirit
can be put into products.</i>

90
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,893
<i>And those products can be manufactured
and given to people,</i>

91
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,354
<i>and they can sense that spirit.</i>

92
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,111
<i>A computer is a straightforward,
everyday machine.</i>

93
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,982
<i>A simple way of studying
the principle of how it works</i>

94
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:15,235
<i>is that a computer is quite dead.</i>

95
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,408
<i>It can do nothing without
someone to give instructions.</i>

96
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,539
<i>When I was growing up,
computers weren't something to love.</i>

97
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,457
<i>They were something to fear.</i>

98
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,878
<i>They were huge, impersonal,
made by faceless corporations.</i>

99
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,128
<i>But for Jobs, it was different.</i>

100
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,176
I saw my first computer
when I was 12 at NASA.

101
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,641
<i>We had a local NASA center
nearby. It was a terminal,</i>

102
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,178
<i>which was connected
to a big computer somewhere.</i>

103
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,101
This is one of the consoles
they might be using in the future.

104
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,437
It looks very much like
just a regular typewriter.

105
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,026
Too often the equipment of the past

106
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,020
has sort of been designed
for other machines.

107
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,317
They're really not for people.

108
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:57,035
I saw my second computer a few
years later, the Hewlett-Packard 9100.

109
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,950
The 9100 computing calculator.

110
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:05,076
It was very large. Had a very small
cathode ray tube on it for display.

111
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,830
And I got a chance to play with
one of those maybe in 1968.

112
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,501
<i>I started going up</i>

113
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,751
<i>to Hewlett-Packard's Palo Alto
research lab every Tuesday night,</i>

114
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:18,052
and I spent every spare moment I had
trying to write programs for it.

115
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,264
I was so fascinated by this.

116
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,936
We have a pointing device
called a mouse.

117
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,646
I don't know why we call it a mouse.

118
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:30,185
<i>By 1968, Stanford's
Doug Engelbart, inventor of the mouse,</i>

119
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,856
<i>was asking new questions</i>

120
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:36,232
<i>about the essential nature of our
changing relationship with computers.</i>

121
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,986
If in your office,
you as an intellectual worker

122
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,955
were supplied with a computer display

123
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:47,202
backed up by a computer
that was alive for you all day

124
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:51,581
and was instantly responsible,
responsive,

125
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,924
instantly responsive
to every action you had,

126
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,051
how much value
could you derive from that?

127
00:09:56,221 --> 00:10:00,181
<i>We needed a guide to help us
navigate this new relationship.</i>

128
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:08,269
<i>My whole adult life has been spent
building personal computers.</i>

129
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,440
<i>So, the history of my vocation
and my avocations</i>

130
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,905
<i>and, you know,
my growing up are all the same,</i>

131
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,738
and it's very hard
to separate one from the other.

132
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,879
<i>I come from a place called
Silicon Valley, California,</i>

133
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,999
<i>and you'll find there are
a lot of electronics kits around.</i>

134
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,049
<i>My electronics teacher realized
that I had a lot of computer ability</i>

135
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,547
<i>that went beyond anything he could
possibly teach me in school.</i>

136
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:45,222
He knew that as long as I was in class,
I was just going to sit around,

137
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,185
playing pranks on the other students

138
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,764
like wrapping little hair wires
around certain circuits

139
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,141
so when they plugged in their radio,
it would blow up.

140
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,823
<i>As hard as I think about it,</i>

141
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,406
<i>I don't think I ever had one friend
who was not one of the tech kids.</i>

142
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:07,448
<i>I met Woz when I was maybe
12 years old, 13 years old.</i>

143
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,292
<i>He was the first person I met
that knew more electronics than I did.</i>

144
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,755
And one of the things that Woz and I did
was we built blue boxes.

145
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,961
<i>One day I picked up a magazine,</i>

146
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:25,341
and I started reading a story
about phone phreaks and blue boxes.

147
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,557
<i>When phone phreaks
have a convention,</i>

148
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,433
<i>as they did in the ballroom
of a seedy New York hotel lately,</i>

149
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:38,188
<i>masks are given out at the door.
People don't give their right names.</i>

150
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:43,280
The blue box was a little device that
put special tones into anybody's phone

151
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,700
and those tones would connect you
anywhere you wanted.

152
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,619
<i>Halfway through reading this,
I called Steve Jobs over</i>

153
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,751
<i>and started reading it to him
over the phone.</i>

154
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,830
There's a way to fool
the entire telephone system

155
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,169
into thinking you were
a telephone computer

156
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,294
and to open up itself and let you call
anywhere in the world for free.

157
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:05,139
<i>You could call from a pay phone,
go to White Plains, New York,</i>

158
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,757
<i>take a satellite to Europe.</i>

159
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,476
<i>And you'd go around the world
and call the pay phone next door.</i>

160
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,729
<i>Shout in the phone,
be about 30 seconds,</i>

161
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,597
<i>it'd come out the other end
of the other phone.</i>

162
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:17,519
And he's like, "Hello,"
There's a lag and, "Hello, how are you?"

163
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,361
"I'm fine." You know?

164
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,903
<i>Why, one might wonder,
would someone want to do that?</i>

165
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,363
<i>To rip off the phone company.</i>

166
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,657
And these were illegal, I have to add.

167
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,500
<i>In college, I had a blue box
of my own. It was important</i>

168
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:37,212
<i>because long-distance phone calls
were really expensive back then.</i>

169
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,842
<i>It was also a way
of sticking it to the man.</i>

170
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,714
<i>This would become an important
selling point for Jobs, too,</i>

171
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:49,558
<i>even as he left
the technical work to others.</i>

172
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,643
<i>Well, I had this blue box design.</i>

173
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,058
<i>I did a trick in there
that I've never done that good a trick</i>

174
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,647
<i>in any other design in my life.</i>

175
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,735
<i>And Steve Jobs said,
"Hey, why don't we sell them?"</i>

176
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,229
<i>You know, you rapidly run
out of people you want to call,</i>

177
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,449
<i>but it was the magic that two teenagers</i>

178
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,284
<i>could build this box
for $100 worth of parts</i>

179
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:13,533
<i>and control hundreds of billions
of dollars of infrastructure</i>

180
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,502
<i>in the entire telephone network
in the whole world.</i>

181
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,755
We could sort of influence the world,
you know?

182
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,547
Control it, in the case of blue boxes,

183
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,134
but something much more powerful
than controlling.

184
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:32,226
Influencing, in the case of Apple.
And they're very closely related.

185
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,810
I really do, to this day,

186
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:37,147
feel that if we hadn't had had
those blue box experiences,

187
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,645
there never would have been
an Apple computer.

188
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,939
<i>I think Jobs
was always a storyteller.</i>

189
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,948
There was always this sense
that he was constructing a persona.

190
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,070
<i>The first time I sat down
with him to work on a story,</i>

191
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,321
he immediately asked me
if I had read.

192
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:57,577
<i>Thomas Kuhn's "The Structure
of Scientific Revolutions."</i>

193
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,455
<i>I think he was assimilating
into this personality,</i>

194
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,923
<i>this notion that he had found in Kuhn.</i>

195
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,210
<i>The random result
that eventually creates</i>

196
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,963
a paradigm shift where everybody
one morning wakes up,

197
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,881
and they think the new way.

198
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:15,136
<i>And I believe that he thought
that he was a paradigm shifter.</i>

199
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:19,231
<i>That was part of his story. He wanted
to have a foot in both worlds.</i>

200
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,943
<i>He wanted to be the renegade,
but he also wanted to be legit.</i>

201
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:29,654
<i>This is the video deposition
of Steven P Jobs.</i>

202
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:33,746
We are on the record at 9:22am.

203
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:38,243
Can we just sort of briefly go over
your employment history after 1973?

204
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:45,546
I was employed by Atari,
a maker of video games.

205
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:51,757
- What timeframe?
- I don't know. Early '70s.

206
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:08,363
Creativity is a lot about anarchy.

207
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,410
<i>I had been in the video-game
business two years</i>

208
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:18,533
and our corporate culture
was really "work hard, play hard."

209
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,751
<i>The true original sin of Apple</i>

210
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,746
literally takes place
before the company is founded.

211
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:27,465
<i>Jobs had left Reed College
and now he was back in Silicon Valley.</i>

212
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,676
<i>Woz was working at HP.</i>

213
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,215
<i>I was such a nerd.</i>

214
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,340
<i>When I finished designing calculators
at Hewlett-Packard in the daytime,</i>

215
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,182
<i>I would work on my own little projects.</i>

216
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,518
<i>I saw "Pong" in a bowling alley,
and I said,</i>

217
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,605
<i>"I know logic design,
and I know electronics of televisions."</i>

218
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:46,773
<i>"I'll use my home TV, snake a wire in,"
and I built myself a "Pong."</i>

219
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,611
Steve came back from Reed College

220
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,322
and saw that I had built
my own <i>Pong</i> game.

221
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,239
<i>And so that gave him the idea
to go down to Atari.</i>

222
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,737
<i>And he went down,
and he showed them the board</i>

223
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,450
<i>and he wound up with a job.</i>

224
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,747
Steve came in and said,
in typical Steve Jobs fashion,

225
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,710
"I'm not going to leave
until you hire me."

226
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:10,506
<i>And I really appreciated his intensity.
He had one speed. Full on.</i>

227
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,970
<i>I had one little project
that everyone kept turning down.</i>

228
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,805
<i>It was a project called "Breakout."</i>

229
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,017
<i>And finally I said,
"Steve, hey, do this for me."</i>

230
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,431
In the back of my mind,

231
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:26,480
I knew that Woz was coming over all
the time after working at HP all day,

232
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:30,230
and I thought,
"OK, I'll put Steve on the night shift."

233
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:33,486
"Woz will come over. I'll get
two Steves for the price of one."

234
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:37,407
<i>Steve said, "Nolan Bushnell
of Atari wants another game built."</i>

235
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,495
<i>But we only had four days, Steve said.</i>

236
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:42,458
<i>When a game is made out of chips
and it's not a program,</i>

237
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,749
<i>four days is, like, impossible.
This is months' worth of work.</i>

238
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:48,793
<i>I did the entire design,</i>

239
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,542
<i>and then Steve would breadboard
my design for a little while.</i>

240
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:56,968
<i>We were up four days and nights
non-stop. Both got mononucleosis.</i>

241
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,012
<i>And we got "Breakout" delivered
to Atari, and they paid for it.</i>

242
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,645
<i>Later on,
Woz and I were out to dinner.</i>

243
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,144
He was talking about <i>Breakout,</i>

244
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,530
and I said, "Well, you know,
you guys got paid pretty well for it."

245
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,275
He looked at me puzzled, and I said,

246
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,574
"Yeah, I mean,
you did such a good job."

247
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:24,791
"I think there was at least
a $5,000 bonus that you guys got."

248
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,788
So, yeah, he was paid $7,000,
and he told me that we were paid $700,

249
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,915
and he wrote me a check for $350.

250
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,217
<i>You know, and that hurts
because we were friends.</i>

251
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,549
<i>And do you do that to a friend?</i>

252
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,765
<i>If he'd said, "I need the money,"
I would have said, "Take it all."</i>

253
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,509
<i>I was happy to be on the project.</i>

254
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,228
I think that Steve...

255
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,354
was very driven

256
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:57,279
and would very often take
shortcuts to achieve his goals.

257
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:06,416
♪ Then in time we'll tell who has fell

258
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,537
<i>♪ And who's been left behind</i>

259
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,915
<i>♪ When you go your way
And I go mine</i>

260
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,092
<i>Apple was a sitcom.
It was a 30-year sitcom.</i>

261
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,681
And Steve was the main character.

262
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,396
<i>This was written in December 1976.</i>

263
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:32,734
In fact it starts out saying,
"Who's Apple," so that was very early.

264
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:39,241
<i>He and Woz came in.
Steve had long hair down his back.</i>

265
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:44,371
<i>He had a Ho Chi Minh beard,
cutoffs, Birkenstocks.</i>

266
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:48,367
And Wozniak was maybe a little bit
upscale from that, but not much.

267
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,619
I used to like Intel's advertising,

268
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,748
So I called them up one day,
and I said, "Who does your advertising?"

269
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,796
They said, "Well, Regis McKenna."
"What's a Regis McKenna?"

270
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,759
They said, "No, it's a person."

271
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:02,677
<i>Wozniak had a technical article
on the Apple II.</i>

272
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,767
<i>He wanted us to try to get it
placed into a magazine.</i>

273
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:10,265
Nobody could read it. It was
all technical jargon and so forth.

274
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,353
<i>And so I told him
I'd have to rewrite it,</i>

275
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,522
<i>and he wasn't happy about that.</i>

276
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,771
He said, "No one's going to rewrite
my stuff."

277
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,863
I said, "Well,
then there's nothing I can do for you",

278
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,107
so you might as well leave."

279
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,527
<i>Steve called back,
and he pretty much convinced me</i>

280
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,780
<i>that he would be the person
that we'd be dealing with</i>

281
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,874
and that Wozniak would be designing
and building things,

282
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,867
which is the way it happens
in most businesses.

283
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,710
The engineers are more back room

284
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:36,666
and you work with either the
entrepreneur or the marketing people.

285
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,461
<i>Did you think early on
that Steve could be the guy?</i>

286
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:44,260
Oh, definitely. You just had to spend
a few minutes with him and you knew it.

287
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,799
<i>He had the ability</i>

288
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:49,849
<i>to talk about the possibility
of what this computer could be.</i>

289
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,815
And I think the key is not just
talking about the product,

290
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:59,029
but giving you an idea
of what is possible using this product

291
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,240
and what the next generation
is going to be like.

292
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:06,203
So he gives people this feeling
of forward movement.

293
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,118
- How many calculators do you own?
- Two, maybe.

294
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,954
Right, and do you use
the automatic bank-telling machines?

295
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,373
- Sure.
- Life is already seducing you

296
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,748
into learning this stuff.
It's not going to happen at once,

297
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,297
and it's certainly not
a <i>1984-ish</i> vision at all.

298
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,178
It's just going to be very gradual
and very human

299
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,798
and will seduce you
into learning how to use it.

300
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,971
<i>Transitioning from a hobby
to a personal computer,</i>

301
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,769
<i>that whole idea was driven by Steve.</i>

302
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,108
He was trying to say
we need to differentiate ourselves

303
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,898
and really move out
of this hobbyist realm.

304
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,897
<i>It ended up
coming out of the room saying,</i>

305
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,820
<i>"We're going to call ourselves
the personal computer."</i>

306
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,568
<i>Industry experts say</i>

307
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,822
<i>we're no longer on the verge
of the personal computer revolution.</i>

308
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,535
<i>We're right in the midst of it,
thank you.</i>

309
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,874
And it's gathering steam

310
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:56,245
with more and more people
jumping aboard every day.

311
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,044
I use my computer right now
for mostly word processing.

312
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,886
I use it for solar evaluation programs.

313
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,130
We put our entire accounting system
on it.

314
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,052
The wife can use it to store recipes.

315
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,595
To balance my checkbook for me.

316
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,385
We do the computer club's bulletin.

317
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,144
- Playing games.
- Shopping by mail.

318
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,559
- Budgeting.
- Bowling-league type scores.

319
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,149
- Electronic mail.
- A guy can be creative on it.

320
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,519
I mean, he can use it
for whatever he can dream up.

321
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,611
This is a 21st-century bicycle

322
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,609
that amplifies a certain intellectual
ability that man has.

323
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,578
The effects that it's going to
have on society

324
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,287
are actually going to far outstrip

325
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,032
even those that the petrochemical
revolution has had.

326
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,168
<i>Time</i> magazine, I think,

327
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,664
said single-handedly he created
the industry because he was relentless.

328
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,592
<i>The powers that be
of "Time" magazine</i>

329
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,182
decided that they would make
the Man of the Year that particular year

330
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,551
the Computer of the Year.

331
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:56,054
<i>I was transferred to the bureau
in San Francisco.</i>

332
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,354
And gradually I began to cotton on
to the fact

333
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:04,025
that there were a lot of stories
in this part of California

334
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:08,196
between San Jose
and San Francisco

335
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,943
about these odd, little companies

336
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,072
that people on the East Coast
at that point

337
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,666
hadn't heard about
and really didn't care about.

338
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,877
<i>And then I got very interested in Apple</i>

339
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:23,715
<i>and Steve was,
of the early characters in the company,</i>

340
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:28,967
the most articulate and the most
interesting and the oddest.

341
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:33,012
<i>Steven Jobs helped build
the first Apple computer in his garage.</i>

342
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:36,181
<i>He is now 26 years old
and is chairman of the board.</i>

343
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,725
<i>There was some debate</i>

344
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,975
<i>over whether or not
they should use the name "Apple."</i>

345
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,944
<i>You know, the whole model
of the computer industry</i>

346
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,733
and the computer business was IBM.

347
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:50,656
<i>Another business service of
tomorrow made possible today by IBM.</i>

348
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,403
IBM was an anonymous organization.

349
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,703
No one knew who the president was.
They probably had no idea.

350
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:02,000
<i>The IBM logo looked like it was
carved out of Roman marble, you know?</i>

351
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,839
It was just
this monolithic kind of thing.

352
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,835
<i>And we took just the opposite,
which was,</i>

353
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,259
<i>"Let's make Steve very high profile.
Let's tell our story."</i>

354
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,224
<i>Working in this garage,
Jobs and a high-school classmate</i>

355
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,684
<i>quit their positions
at large electronic companies,</i>

356
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:21,432
<i>and using tiny silicon chips,
built this small computer board.</i>

357
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:31,400
<i>Funny, the garage story was
less of a feature in those early days.</i>

358
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,115
<i>It later on became more of a look back</i>

359
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:39,037
<i>when people started doing stories
on the background, and so forth.</i>

360
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:45,165
You know, I told Steve this,
and most of my clients in fact,

361
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:49,168
there's a song in <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i>
that Tevye sings.

362
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:53,673
He says, "If I were a rich man."
And he said, "I'd sit in the temple,

363
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,891
and I'd lecture to the wise men
all day long,

364
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,976
"and it wouldn't matter
if you're right or wrong."

365
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,766
"When you're rich,
they think you know."

366
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,514
So, in a technology business,

367
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,526
you have to show that you are successful
in order to have a platform.

368
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,233
<i>It led to
a quarter-billion-dollar business</i>

369
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:13,325
<i>and the most popular typewriter-sized
computer on the market today.</i>

370
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,240
Steve Jobs,
I realize this is your baby,

371
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,949
and you've made a career out of it,

372
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:20,540
but you're also
something of a philosopher.

373
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:24,794
Do you see the inherent possibility
of bad coming out of all of this?

374
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,255
Well, I think one of the things
you really have to look at

375
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:30,091
is you have to go watch
some kids using these things.

376
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:33,383
<i>And what you find is far
from something quite harmful.</i>

377
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,005
<i>In effect, what you see</i>

378
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,971
<i>is an instantaneous reflection
of a part of themselves,</i>

379
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,561
the creative part of themselves
being expressed.

380
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,988
<i>He was going for a computer</i>

381
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:56,235
<i>that really felt like
an extension of the self.</i>

382
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,284
That's what people wanted, and I think
he sensed that. He knew that.

383
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:05,832
<i>My first book on the computer culture
was called "The Second Self."</i>

384
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,920
<i>The key quote
that gave me the title was,</i>

385
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,631
"When you think of a computer,"

386
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:14,841
you put a little piece of your mind
into the computer's mind,

387
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,259
"and you come to think
of yourself differently."

388
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:23,012
Our whole company,
our whole philosophical base,

389
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:27,273
is founded on one principle.
And that one principle

390
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:32,271
is that there's something very special
and very historically different

391
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:36,867
that takes place when you have
one computer and one person.

392
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,703
<i>Did you have an opportunity
to meet Jobs?</i>

393
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,156
<i>Yes,
I met him on several occasions.</i>

394
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,284
And did you sense
from talking to him

395
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,502
that he really did understand
what he was doing?

396
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,791
I think he understood what he was doing.

397
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:54,297
<i>He knew
he had created something intimate</i>

398
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,504
<i>and that could be sold
as something intimate.</i>

399
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,222
And it would be you.
I mean, it would be for you.

400
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:04,469
It wasn't just for you. It was you.

401
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,728
Can you just show me
the front of it?

402
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,693
That's the part
that most people would recognize.

403
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:19,568
This is a piece that everybody
remembers from the ads,

404
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:23,322
from the <i>Time</i> magazine cover
with Steve holding it in his lap.

405
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:29,411
And this is the famous beige that
we're never going to have any more of.

406
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,208
He hated this even at this time,

407
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,708
but we were kind of stuck with it
by the time we got there.

408
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,176
It was a fun little machine.

409
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:48,187
<i>He called me just out of the blue.
I was working at Xerox.</i>

410
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:52,317
And I picked up the phone,
and it was Steve Jobs.

411
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,937
And he said, "I hear you're a good guy",

412
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:59,487
but everything you've done so far
is crap. Come work for me."

413
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:05,113
<i>I told my wife at the time.
I said, "Well, what could happen?"</i>

414
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,911
<i>"How bad could this be?"</i>

415
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,370
I didn't realize how bad it could be.

416
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,254
<i>First trip Steve ever made to Japan</i>

417
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:20,424
<i>was to see what we could do about
getting a disc drive for the machine.</i>

418
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:25,517
<i>And we saw the Sony disc facility
in Atsugi, Japan.</i>

419
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:30,810
He had a lot of affection for Sony
because the Walkman was a machine

420
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,020
that he just thought
was the bee's knees.

421
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,065
♪ You really feel the music
with a Sony Walkman

422
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,564
<i>The Sony Walkman is
a tiny stereo cassette player</i>

423
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,154
<i>with truly incredible sound.</i>

424
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,744
<i>♪ You really feel the music
You really feel it</i>

425
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,368
I think it was the first product
in human history

426
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,742
that went over a billion units.
That he liked.

427
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,333
One of things that Steve thought
was important,

428
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,126
and Jerry Manock facilitated it,

429
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,671
was this is
where all the signatures are.

430
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:02,295
And they're all the people,
the original group,

431
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:08,974
that actually signed the machine.
There's Steve Jobs right in the middle.

432
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,937
My name is over here.

433
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,598
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

434
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:17,569
Because the people that worked
on it consider themselves,

435
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,154
and I certainly consider them, artists.

436
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,649
These are the people that
under different circumstances

437
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:26,994
<i>would be painters and poets, but,
because of the time that we live in,</i>

438
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,239
<i>this new medium has appeared</i>

439
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,538
<i>in which to express oneself
to one's fellow species.</i>

440
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:36,037
And that's a medium of computing.

441
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:45,214
<i>We would sit
in the temples in Kyoto,</i>

442
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:49,719
<i>just taking off our shoes at the door
and sitting.</i>

443
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:07,323
<i>Did he take from that any
kind of aesthetic vision, do you think?</i>

444
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:11,573
<i>I think certainly. A simplicity.</i>

445
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,044
Just feeling that inner calm

446
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:20,290
that's so available
at some places in Japan.

447
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:25,925
<i>He was a very much a person
who was comfortable in silence.</i>

448
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:40,777
Steve ruled by a kind of a chaos.
And it's easy to make chaos,

449
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,818
and if you're comfortable with it,
you can use it as a tool.

450
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,114
<i>And he used a vast number
of really irritating tools</i>

451
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:52,615
to get other people involved
in his schemes.

452
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:59,747
<i>He's seducing you, he's vilifying you
and he's ignoring you.</i>

453
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,588
You're in one of those three states.

454
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:07,967
<i>When you get a core group of,
you know, ten great people,</i>

455
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:12,601
<i>it becomes self-policing
as to who they let into that group.</i>

456
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:18,144
So, I consider the most important job
of someone like myself is recruiting.

457
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:21,851
<i>Steve Jobs brought us all together
in a place that had no rules.</i>

458
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:26,448
He's a maniac. He's a maniacal genius.
His job is to stir up everything.

459
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,909
<i>Most places in life
are continuously telling you</i>

460
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,286
<i>that your dreams aren't possible
or practical.</i>

461
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,451
You don't want to hear that
when you're under 30.

462
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,245
What you want to do is race after them.

463
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,867
You ask yourself, why are you doing it?

464
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,873
I'm certainly not doing it
for Steve Jobs.

465
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,588
I'm doing it for what I think is
a much greater good than that.

466
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:45,959
Everybody just wanted to work, not
because it was work that had to be done,

467
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,503
but it was because it was something
that we really believed in.

468
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:54,134
Here is how we see personal computers.
Here is how we want the world to be.

469
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,761
And here's how we're going to change it.

470
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,479
We have a vision
of what we want it to be.

471
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,974
We want to convert people.
We want to make converts.

472
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:04,144
<i>I felt my job at Macintosh</i>

473
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,738
<i>was to make the division
work smoothly enough</i>

474
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,701
<i>that we could actually get this thing
from really a mess of kids</i>

475
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,536
<i>playing around with a bunch
of hardware and software</i>

476
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,327
<i>into something that would be
a commercial product.</i>

477
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,122
And that's what I did.
I got that machine finished.

478
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:32,505
<i>It is now 1984.</i>

479
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,475
IBM became the apparent visible threat.

480
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,561
IBM wants it all,
and is aiming its guns

481
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:43,023
on its last obstacle
to industry control. Apple.

482
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,485
Will Big Blue dominate
the entire computer industry?

483
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:50,448
The entire information age?
Was George Orwell right?

484
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:55,453
<i>Today, we celebrate
the first glorious anniversary</i>

485
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,448
<i>over the information
purification directives.</i>

486
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,542
<i>That ad was again
a juxtaposition with IBM.</i>

487
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,627
<i>- That's what it was about.
- Yeah.</i>

488
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,213
<i>The people in the audience
were mindless IBM users.</i>

489
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,207
<i>Yes. You know,
for Steve it was great</i>

490
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:12,587
because he had this bad guy/good guy,
and he loved playing that role.

491
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:16,636
<i>We shall prevail!</i>

492
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,863
<i>Looking back, behind the scenes,</i>

493
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:42,496
<i>it's easy to see the irony in the ad.</i>

494
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,539
<i>Today, Apple is Goliath.</i>

495
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,128
Rolling. Rolling.

496
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,205
<i>But even in 1984,</i>

497
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,126
<i>when Apple cast itself
as the counterculture company,</i>

498
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,762
<i>working at Apple was a lot tougher
than IBM.</i>

499
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,012
<i>I think if you talk to a lot of
people on the Mac team,</i>

500
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:05,141
they will tell you it was the hardest
they've ever worked in their life.

501
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,024
Some of them will tell you
it was, you know,

502
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:08,984
the happiest they've ever been
in their life,

503
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,024
but I think all of them will tell you

504
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:14,490
that it is certainly one of the most
intense and cherished experiences

505
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:15,984
they will ever have in their life.

506
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,953
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, they did.
- So...

507
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,742
You know...

508
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:29,960
Some of those things are
not sustainable for some people.

509
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,347
<i>I ended up
changing my entire life.</i>

510
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,766
I lost my wife in that process.

511
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:44,558
I lost my children in that process.
I lost...

512
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:48,441
The whole structure of my life
was just changed forever

513
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:52,562
by going and working on the Mac.

514
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,780
Because the work
became so intense?

515
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,365
The work was intense.

516
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,530
The commitment needed to do it
was intense.

517
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,655
<i>I would go into work
on a Tuesday morning</i>

518
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,656
<i>and half the people would hate me,</i>

519
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,408
<i>and I'd come back on Wednesday morning,</i>

520
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,168
<i>and half the people would hate me,
but it was the other half.</i>

521
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,751
<i>There were an awful lot
of prima donnas in that outfit,</i>

522
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,590
<i>so I was always in conflict.</i>

523
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:20,515
Here's the piece you wrote.
You want to read it?

524
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:26,391
"Steve's passing did come
as a bit of a shock for me."

525
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:31,393
"For a bit more than three years,
1982 to 1985,

526
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:34,236
we were together a lot of the time."

527
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:38,491
"We made a dozen trips to Japan
together. We were close."

528
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,656
"After that,
I only saw him a few times."

529
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,155
"I haven't seen him in many years."

530
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:48,667
"He was an extraordinary person in many
ways and quite normal in others."

531
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,254
<i>"The outpouring of feelings
from people all over the world</i>

532
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:57,130
<i>was a bit of a surprise to me at first,
and then it seemed natural."</i>

533
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:00,050
<i>"He was for them
a combination of James Dean,</i>

534
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:04,050
<i>Princess Diana and John Lennon
and maybe Santa Claus."</i>

535
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,849
"What is in that bag of goodies?"

536
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:12,642
<i>"The iPod, the iPhone
and the iPad are so personal."</i>

537
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:17,772
<i>"They are warm in your hand.
They sing to you when you're alone."</i>

538
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,364
<i>"They are caressed."</i>

539
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,156
"In those three years together,

540
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:26,247
I packed in a decade or two
of experience."

541
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:31,787
"Steve packed in a couple of centuries
in his 56 years."

542
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:36,461
"He did everything he wanted,
and all on his own terms."

543
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,461
"It was a life well and fully lived,

544
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:43,055
even if it was a bit expensive
for those of us who were close."

545
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:50,062
You do have friends, you know?

546
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,308
Even if they're bizarre people.

547
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:58,480
Yes. He is.
He's one of those mythic characters.

548
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:05,658
Yeah, and they're not that much fun
on the ground most of the time,

549
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:09,328
but there are those moments
when suddenly...

550
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,703
They're the only person
who could've ever done it.

551
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,288
Right.

552
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:19,084
- Yeah, and they change us.
- Right.

553
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,774
<i>Without death,
there would be very little progress.</i>

554
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:39,316
<i>I'm sure that life evolved
without death at first</i>

555
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:44,826
<i>and found that without death,
life didn't work very well.</i>

556
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:48,321
<i>Because it didn't make room
for the young</i>

557
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:52,913
<i>who didn't know how the world was,
you know, 50 years ago,</i>

558
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,754
<i>but who saw it as it is today
without any preconceptions</i>

559
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,248
<i>and dreamed how it could be
based on that.</i>

560
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:07,181
<i>The minute that you understand
that you can poke life,</i>

561
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,140
<i>you can change it, you can mold it,</i>

562
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,886
<i>you'll want to change life
and make it better</i>

563
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,013
<i>cos it's kind of messed up
in a lot of ways.</i>

564
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,234
<i>Once you learn that,
you'll never be the same again.</i>

565
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,990
<i>Just be here.</i>

566
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:30,955
<i>Don't judge, don't try,
don't stop, don't start. Just be here.</i>

567
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,698
<i>It's all just enough.</i>

568
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,996
<i>It's enough to know that I love you.</i>

569
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:47,297
<i>Steve and I met two weeks into
our freshman year at Reed College.</i>

570
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:51,642
<i>We had both happened to buy
"Be Here Now."</i>

571
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,725
And it was such an unusual book.
I just wanted...

572
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,975
I was carrying it around
and wanted somebody to talk to about it,

573
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,353
and Steve was the one person
who also had read it.

574
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,286
<i>When we went to India,</i>

575
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:15,909
<i>we were looking for
remarkable experiences.</i>

576
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:19,583
<i>We didn't have a guru.
We didn't have a particular school.</i>

577
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,832
<i>And so we traveled around
for four months.</i>

578
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:29,931
<i>Had some interesting experiences.
No major enlightenment experiences.</i>

579
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,425
Steve's quote later was,

580
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:35,094
"We had figured out that
we weren't going to meet somebody

581
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,438
who was going to make us enlightened."

582
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:42,401
<i>If you think about Hindu spirituality,</i>

583
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,439
<i>you think of Mother Teresa
feeding the poor.</i>

584
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:49,950
<i>That's not really the path
that Steve took.</i>

585
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,741
Those weren't Steve's values.

586
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,825
<i>It was the next year,
after India,</i>

587
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:02,001
<i>when he connected
with the Zen Center in Los Altos.</i>

588
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:08,594
<i>Zen is about clarity,
simplicity, cleanliness.</i>

589
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:15,264
<i>Ending the duality of your ego
and simplifying your life.</i>

590
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:18,479
<i>And that really appealed to Steve.</i>

591
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:23,313
It's based on taking off
and creating something for yourself.

592
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:27,438
You know, giving life to your own life
in whatever way you wish to do it.

593
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,991
<i>At the time
he was starting Apple,</i>

594
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,908
<i>Steve was very actively looking
for a mentor.</i>

595
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:43,208
<i>Kobun Chino would
become Jobs's spiritual advisor.</i>

596
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:47,716
<i>Kobun encouraged Jobs
not to retreat into a monastery,</i>

597
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:51,554
<i>but instead to find Zen
in his life and work.</i>

598
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,848
<i>But they would argue
over the path to enlightenment.</i>

599
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:14,907
Steve always says, "Make me monk.
Please make me monk."

600
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:18,327
I say, "Not until proof."

601
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:26,046
When I was living in California,
23 years ago...

602
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,961
Midnight...

603
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:32,883
I answered the doorbell and there he is.

604
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:36,052
18 years old, he was.

605
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:39,427
And he wanted to see me.

606
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,064
And I looked into his eyes, and...

607
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:48,061
They looked terrible,
but he is not crazy.

608
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:51,405
I must talk with him.

609
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:57,028
I took him for a walk
through the downtown of Los Altos.

610
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,198
All stores closed.

611
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:06,295
One bar called The Teacup was open.

612
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,833
We sat down at the counter.

613
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:17,716
I had Irish coffee and he had juice.

614
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:23,062
After sipping, he started to talk.

615
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:29,444
He said, "I feel I'm enlightened."

616
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,358
"I don't know what to do with this."

617
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:41,122
That's wonderful.
That is very wonderful.

618
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,789
I need proof of it.

619
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:53,588
A week later he came back

620
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:59,098
with a little metal sheet in his hand.

621
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:03,932
Many things were going,
wires going around...

622
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,680
I didn't know what it was.

623
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:12,277
It was a chip of a personal computer.

624
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:20,120
He said, "I designed it.
My friend Woz helped me."

625
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:26,501
"This is called Lisa."

626
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,584
"I named it Lisa."

627
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:34,842
Which is the name of his daughter.

628
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:40,427
That was the origin of Apple Computer.

629
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:49,315
And I'm still not quite sure
that was a true proof or not.

630
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:54,654
He's brilliant, but too smart, I think.

631
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:03,908
When you broke the Lisa story,
why was that important?

632
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,454
There was a computer called "Lisa."

633
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:12,705
And everybody wondered
who the computer was named after.

634
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,964
I didn't choose
to name the computer "Lisa."

635
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:22,430
I was obviously curious
about why it was named "Lisa".

636
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,852
Fair or unfair, I think that was,

637
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:30,347
to me,
that was a germane part of the story.

638
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:43,243
<i>♪ With your mercury mouth</i>

639
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:47,581
<i>♪ In the missionary times</i>

640
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:51,167
<i>♪ And your eyes like smoke</i>

641
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,958
<i>I was 17, sitting in the quad.</i>

642
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:57,800
<i>Early spring,
warm and cold at the same time.</i>

643
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:03,636
And I look over, and there's
this guy I have never seen.

644
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:09,683
I've been there for three years.
I can't believe how gorgeous he is.

645
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:16,152
<i>And he starts to walk out of the quad,
and I followed him</i>

646
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:19,693
<i>cos I thought,
"I've got to introduce myself to him."</i>

647
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:24,990
And I'm going, "What do I say?"
I had no idea what to say.

648
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:28,330
<i>A few months later,
I was working on a film.</i>

649
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:33,953
<i>We worked all night long,
and he walks up out of the dark.</i>

650
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:38,628
He was confident and awkward.
He was a study in contrasts.

651
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:44,801
And he had jeans on that drooped
because they had so many holes in them.

652
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:48,263
And he was very intentional,
very intense.

653
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:53,981
<i>And then he handed me a poem
by Bob Dylan.</i>

654
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,437
<i>"Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands."</i>

655
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:02,781
<i>He would re-write Dylan's songs
to fit his life.</i>

656
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:09,492
And then he... he just scanned the quad

657
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:13,493
and the darkness
that went over his face...

658
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:21,672
The edge, the worry,
the dissonance, was shocking to me.

659
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:25,546
And I was young enough where I thought,
"Did I say something wrong?"

660
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:28,344
But later I realized
that wasn't what it was.

661
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,468
That was part of who he was.

662
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:33,266
And I mean, that was one of the things
that I was attracted to,

663
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:36,265
is that he had a lot going on
inside him.

664
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,822
Steve was a romantic,
and he really loved Chrisann.

665
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:47,325
<i>I think she was
a seductive force in his life,</i>

666
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:53,996
<i>and there was a part of Steve
that didn't want to push that away.</i>

667
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,413
But the main thing in Steve's life,
number one,

668
00:45:56,545 --> 00:46:00,084
was getting Apple off the ground.

669
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:03,675
<i>And he just really could not focus
on anything else.</i>

670
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:08,259
<i>I came out in June of '77,</i>

671
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:13,511
<i>and the three of us went
and rented a house in Cupertino.</i>

672
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:19,392
<i>Apple is beginning.
Steve and I are falling in love again.</i>

673
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:22,144
But we're going back and forth
big time now.

674
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,615
It's just like I'm insecure
because he's so unkind,

675
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:30,156
and then we connect.

676
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:36,033
<i>But I don't know how to handle
how fast Steve's mind is</i>

677
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:39,286
<i>and how fast
he throws negative stuff at me.</i>

678
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:44,925
And by the time I figure out,
"I've got to get out of here..."

679
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,428
Um...

680
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:51,469
"This is not working."

681
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:57,562
Um... "I don't want to be in their club,
Daniel's or just even with Steve."

682
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:03,311
"It's just not working."
That's when I got pregnant.

683
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:07,857
What happened when
you told Steve that you were pregnant?

684
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,779
Um...

685
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,574
I told Steve in the dining room.

686
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:18,917
Steve's jaw clenched.

687
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,914
And searing anger...

688
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,128
And he runs out the door,
kind of like a teenager,

689
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,796
slams the door.

690
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:41,265
<i>She got pregnant.</i>

691
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,486
And Steve just was, "Not... not...
not me."

692
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,152
"It's not me. It's not me," right?

693
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:53,945
Even though that was not
a reasonable thing to say.

694
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:59,449
<i>After Lisa was born,
Steve came up three days later.</i>

695
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:02,293
<i>And we're sitting in a field,
and he...</i>

696
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:05,414
We're like, trying to negotiate...

697
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:10,802
what name we both feel good about
for her.

698
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,593
He knows he's the father.

699
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:19,929
<i>He comes with the idea
of wanting to call her Claire,</i>

700
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:23,774
<i>and I don't want Claire because
it's too much like Clara,</i>

701
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,563
<i>his mother's name.</i>

702
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,310
So, we're looking through the book,

703
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,608
and we're thinking
and going back and forth,

704
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,323
trying different names,
and finally I go, "Lisa!"

705
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:37,954
<i>He said, "Yeah!"
We both loved that name.</i>

706
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:44,750
<i>But later I realized he wanted
to name a line of computers</i>

707
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,042
<i>or the next computer
the "Claire."</i>

708
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:50,550
<i>I only knew this later.</i>

709
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:55,890
He went back to Apple
and changed it to the "Lisa."

710
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:04,852
<i>It says a lot about somebody</i>

711
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:11,948
that they would have the wit,
the imagination, the audacity,

712
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:16,990
to name a computer in the fashion
that Steve named this

713
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:22,992
and believe that you're going to
be able to get away with it.

714
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:29,498
<i>That is the sort
of very telling anecdote</i>

715
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:33,468
<i>that helps illuminate
somebody's personality.</i>

716
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,480
<i>My biological mother was
a young, unwed graduate student,</i>

717
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:48,476
<i>and she decided
to put me up for adoption.</i>

718
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:50,318
<i>So, everything was all set</i>

719
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:53,939
<i>for me to be adopted at birth
by a lawyer and his wife.</i>

720
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,066
Except that when I popped out,

721
00:49:56,243 --> 00:50:00,078
they decided at the last minute
that they really wanted a girl.

722
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,660
So, my parents,
who were on a waiting list,

723
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,746
got a call in the middle
of the night, asking,

724
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,830
"We've got an unexpected baby boy.
Do you want him?"

725
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,298
They said, "Of course."

726
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:15,635
My biological mother found out later

727
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:18,346
that my mother had never
graduated from college

728
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:21,475
and that my father had never
graduated from high school.

729
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:25,729
She refused to sign
the final adoption papers.

730
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,722
She only relented a few months later

731
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:31,818
when my parents promised
that I would go to college.

732
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,817
This was the start in my life.

733
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:41,779
<i>You know, another paradox
for him, you know, here's a guy,</i>

734
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:44,657
<i>you know, being pissed off
that he was left for adoption,</i>

735
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,626
<i>and when he has a child,
he wants to run the other way.</i>

736
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:50,211
<i>Yes, that's a huge paradox.</i>

737
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:55,593
Even when I first met Steve, the fact
that he was given up for adoption

738
00:50:55,719 --> 00:51:01,681
was a huge emotional issue
in his life.

739
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:05,598
<i>I was, I remember,
right here on the lawn</i>

740
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:09,939
<i>telling Lisa McMoyler, who lived
across the street, that I was adopted,</i>

741
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:14,107
<i>and she said, "So, does that mean
your real parents didn't want you?"</i>

742
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:17,106
<i>Ooh, lightening bolt. I remember
running into the house.</i>

743
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:21,326
<i>I think I started crying, asking
my parents, and they sat me down.</i>

744
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,365
<i>They said,
"No, you don't understand."</i>

745
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,615
<i>They said,
"We specifically picked you."</i>

746
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:33,330
<i>That was clearly
a very defining image in his life,</i>

747
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,750
<i>both that he was rejected
and that he was special.</i>

748
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,763
<i>The IPO was November 1980.</i>

749
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,258
<i>By the summer of 1980,
it was clear it was going to happen,</i>

750
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:48,478
<i>and so Steve's net worth
was going to go from $10 million</i>

751
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:51,223
<i>to around $200 million.</i>

752
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,646
<i>And I think he had the opportunity
to completely reinvent himself.</i>

753
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:02,155
<i>In his reinvention, some
people who helped him were left behind.</i>

754
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,952
<i>Woz had no taste for management,</i>

755
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:09,245
<i>so he left Apple with a big stock
package and a lifetime stipend.</i>

756
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:14,459
<i>Daniel Kottke had been
one of Apple's first employees.</i>

757
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,458
<i>In the run-up to the IPO,
an Apple executive offered</i>

758
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:20,552
<i>to give Daniel the same amount
of stock that Steve would give.</i>

759
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:24,889
<i>Steve replied,
"Fine. I'll give him zero."</i>

760
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:33,433
<i>Jobs also saw an opportunity
to rewrite his history with Chrisann.</i>

761
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:38,187
<i>He composed a fiction which implied
she had many sexual partners,</i>

762
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,279
<i>and he claimed he was sterile</i>

763
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:45,160
<i>and therefore did not have the physical
capacity to procreate a child.</i>

764
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:53,161
<i>A woman with a baby,
and I was that threatening to them.</i>

765
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:56,629
<i>"If he'd said," I can't do this,
but let me help</i>

766
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,875
because I can be practical here,"

767
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,002
that would have been...

768
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,762
made for so much.

769
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:09,100
But it almost seemed that the point
was to be out of integrity.

770
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:14,272
<i>When a court-ordered DNA test
proved Jobs's paternity,</i>

771
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,684
<i>he stopped fighting Chrisann
in court.</i>

772
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,693
<i>She was on welfare at the time,</i>

773
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:24,949
<i>so Jobs reluctantly agreed to pay
$500 a month in child support.</i>

774
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:30,823
<i>When Apple went public,
he was worth nearly $200 million.</i>

775
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:33,701
<i>Steve is so hugely successful,</i>

776
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:37,500
<i>and yet he treated
so many people so badly.</i>

777
00:53:37,673 --> 00:53:41,917
How much of an asshole
do you have to be to be successful?

778
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,009
What is the moral of the story here?

779
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:46,380
<i>Hello. I am Macintosh.</i>

780
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:50,267
<i>It is with considerable pride
that I introduce a man</i>

781
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:53,683
<i>who's been like a father to me.
Steve Jobs.</i>

782
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,536
<i>He didn't know
what real connection was.</i>

783
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:24,259
So he was a part of the technology
that connected the world.

784
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:27,045
Does that make sense?

785
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:32,726
He made up another kind of connection.

786
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:41,063
You know,
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

787
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:47,403
There's a version of Steve Jobs
presenting the iPhone

788
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:52,913
<i>where you can see his own feeling
of "I love this object."</i>

789
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,622
Isn't this awesome?

790
00:54:54,833 --> 00:55:01,421
His stuff was beloved,
but it wasn't that he was beloved.

791
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,798
<i>He wasn't a nice guy.</i>

792
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:06,509
<i>First, he had a reputation
as a womanizer,</i>

793
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:07,923
<i>and then he had a reputation</i>

794
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:13,050
<i>as sort of not caring about anybody
and as being kind of a tough guy.</i>

795
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:19,105
<i>People are not connected to him
because of his character.</i>

796
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:22,067
That is not people's connection to him.

797
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:25,938
In <i>Be Here Now</i> by Ram Dass,

798
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:30,317
one of the memories I still have
after all these years

799
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:34,742
<i>was when someone goes into
a state of enlightenment...</i>

800
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:40,119
<i>but they do it while
they're still attached to their ego...</i>

801
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:46,091
<i>They call that, as I recall him
saying it, "the golden chain."</i>

802
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:52,013
<i>And that's what I feel
happened to Steve.</i>

803
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:59,597
<i>He went into magnificence
and into enlightenment, but he...</i>

804
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,099
He just...

805
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:05,522
He blew it.

806
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:11,031
<i>Steve Jobs blew it?</i>

807
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,698
<i>How many people in the world
believe that?</i>

808
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:18,039
<i>He made products everyone loved.</i>

809
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:22,794
<i>He was the computer era's
most successful entrepreneur.</i>

810
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:25,834
<i>How could anyone think he blew it?</i>

811
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:30,134
<i>The entrepreneur's a person
who wants to shake things up,</i>

812
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:34,051
who wants to change things,
who sees a better way of doing that.

813
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:37,550
But he or she tends to be
a royal pain in the neck.

814
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:40,641
<i>Apple computer has sued
its co-founder and former chairman,</i>

815
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:43,310
<i>Steven Jobs, to stop him
from starting a rival company.</i>

816
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:48,028
Jobs quit Apple last week in a bitter
fight with his board and management.

817
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:49,737
<i>So, Apple is reorganizing.</i>

818
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:53,654
<i>John Sculley is taking control
from Steven Jobs.</i>

819
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:56,653
<i>Tell us about your departure
from Apple.</i>

820
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:01,040
Oh, it was very painful. I'm not even
sure I want to talk about it. Um...

821
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,834
What can I say? I hired the wrong guy.

822
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,423
- That was Sculley?
- Yeah.

823
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:15,673
<i>And... he destroyed everything
I'd spent ten years working for.</i>

824
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:35,196
<i>What did you do
after you left Apple in 1985?</i>

825
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:39,158
I started two companies.

826
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,155
One was started

827
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:46,537
<i>by buying the computer-graphics
division of Lucasfilm.</i>

828
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,456
<i>We christened it Pixar.</i>

829
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:53,130
<i>Pixar was acquired by Disney.</i>

830
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:56,550
<i>I'm on the board of directors
of the Walt Disney Company.</i>

831
00:57:57,766 --> 00:58:00,383
<i>And the other was called NeXT.</i>

832
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:06,056
From having left
or been bounced from Apple,

833
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:08,308
did he have a kind of a chip
on his shoulder?

834
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:13,359
Was there some...
Was this Steve in the wilderness?

835
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,447
I don't think he felt he was
in the wilderness at all.

836
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:19,489
I think he felt he was on a path.
He was on a mission.

837
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,578
Where are we going to?

838
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,331
<i>In 1986, after he had left Apple</i>

839
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,293
<i>and was in the process
of starting this new company,</i>

840
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:30,622
<i>"Esquire" convinced him to
give a journalist a week of his time.</i>

841
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,382
<i>So, I basically spent that week
with him,</i>

842
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,844
<i>talked to him a lot, went to dinner,
sat in on meetings,</i>

843
00:58:36,972 --> 00:58:41,433
and got to see Jobs as he was
at that moment in his life.

844
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,803
But, I mean, I agree that...
Let me back up a bit.

845
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,474
So, somebody's got to say,

846
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:49,724
"Here's what we can do,
and we can make it happen,

847
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:53,149
and here's the level of thing
we can ship in 16 months."

848
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,647
And what I hear him saying is,

849
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:58,237
"Well, anything more than
a port of Mac author, forget it."

850
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,155
And boy, that just makes me smoke.

851
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:02,825
<i>If he was in a meeting
and somebody said,</i>

852
00:59:02,998 --> 00:59:07,288
"Here's a great idea," and put the idea
out there and he didn't like it,

853
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:09,706
he'd just chop the person
into mincemeat.

854
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,872
The problem I've got, though,
is one,

855
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:14,966
will everybody believe
that the stake is in fact in the ground,

856
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,800
and, secondly,
when software comes back

857
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,045
and says what they can do
by summer or spring of '87,

858
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,422
will they be telling us the truth?

859
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,807
Well, George, I can't change the world,
you know.

860
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:25,096
What do you want me to do?
What's the solution?

861
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,890
But you see,
what we can learn is...

862
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:29,309
What I want is probably irrelevant.

863
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:31,558
I mean,
there are certain realities here,

864
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:35,027
both psychological and market,

865
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:39,115
that are going to come into play,
in my own personal judgment.

866
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,110
And I think this is a window
that we've got. We've been given it.

867
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,703
And thank God we've been given it.
Nobody else has done this.

868
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:47,115
It's a wonderful window.
We have 18 months.

869
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:52,037
<i>The article was about people
who are maniacal about work.</i>

870
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:54,915
<i>And Steve Jobs was the most maniacal
person I could think of,</i>

871
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,216
<i>which is why I wanted
to write about him.</i>

872
00:59:57,344 --> 01:00:00,052
<i>You made the connection
in that first piece a bunch of times,</i>

873
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,967
<i>you know, the monk among priests.</i>

874
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:05,217
<i>What was the relationship
between that extreme</i>

875
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:08,265
<i>of working 24/7
and that monastic life?</i>

876
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:12,231
I mean, he did seem to have
that rather interesting dedication.

877
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:17,150
OK, so, a monomaniacal commitment
to something

878
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,567
is something
that most people don't have.

879
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:28,624
<i>And that, like the monk, requires you
to kind of shed extraneous things,</i>

880
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:32,084
<i>and Steve Jobs absolutely,
positively had that.</i>

881
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,885
<i>Jobs talked about
becoming a monk</i>

882
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:53,060
<i>at this remote Zen temple
where Kobun Chino had studied.</i>

883
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,398
<i>I wonder what he liked
about the idea of it.</i>

884
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:10,578
<i>Was it the discipline of the monks?
Their unwavering focus?</i>

885
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:31,682
<i>In meditation, Jobs loved
inspecting his own mind</i>

886
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,770
<i>and changing the way it worked.</i>

887
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,557
<i>He focused on the spirit of things</i>

888
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:39,857
<i>and sought perfection
in the machines he made.</i>

889
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:44,403
<i>But Kobun thought
Jobs was missing the point.</i>

890
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:47,944
<i>A search for perfection
would never bring him peace</i>

891
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,662
<i>or harmony with those around him.</i>

892
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:56,828
<i>But maybe harmony is
what Jobs was looking for in Japan.</i>

893
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:03,088
<i>He went there dozens of times,
and not just for business.</i>

894
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:06,384
<i>He stayed in fancy hotels,
not Zen temples,</i>

895
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:09,723
<i>but right to the end,
he kept going back.</i>

896
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:18,642
<i>After he met and later married
Laurene Powell,</i>

897
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:21,520
<i>he would take three
of his four children there,</i>

898
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:23,487
<i>including Lisa.</i>

899
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:29,240
<i>Jobs's relationship with Lisa
remained full of conflict,</i>

900
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:34,165
<i>but a few years before Jobs's death,
Lisa wrote about a moment of peace.</i>

901
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:40,668
<i>I didn't live with him, but he
would stop by our house some days,</i>

902
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:44,592
<i>a deity among us for
a few tingly moments or hours.</i>

903
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:49,255
<i>He was a more extreme vegetarian
than my mother and I</i>

904
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:51,348
<i>and sharp-focused.</i>

905
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:55,595
<i>One day, he spit out a mouthful of soup
after hearing it contained butter.</i>

906
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:59,940
<i>With him, one ate a variety of salads.</i>

907
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:05,150
<i>He believed that great harvests
came from arid sources.</i>

908
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:07,319
<i>Pleasure from restraint.</i>

909
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:11,660
<i>He knew the equations
that most people didn't know.</i>

910
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,576
<i>Things led to their opposites.</i>

911
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:19,748
<i>But once, he took me with him
on a business trip to Tokyo</i>

912
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:23,964
<i>where we went to a sushi bar
in the basement of the Okura hotel</i>

913
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:28,837
<i>with its high ceilings and low couches,
like a Hitchcock set.</i>

914
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:33,262
<i>He ordered great trays of unagi sushi,
cooked eel on rice.</i>

915
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:37,433
<i>He ordered too many pieces, knowing
we wouldn't be able to finish them,</i>

916
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:40,932
<i>but that we didn't want
to feel they would run out.</i>

917
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:44,102
<i>It was the first time I'd felt,
with him,</i>

918
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:48,151
<i>so relaxed and content
over those trays of meat.</i>

919
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:52,994
<i>The excess, the permission and warmth
after the cold salads</i>

920
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:58,454
<i>meant a once inaccessible space
had opened.</i>

921
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:01,293
<i>He was less rigid with himself,</i>

922
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:05,165
<i>even human under the great ceilings
with the little chairs,</i>

923
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:07,545
<i>with the meat and me.</i>

924
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:14,591
<i>But the event was not self-sustaining.
We went back home to salads.</i>

925
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:18,686
<i>They satisfied me less
now that I knew the alternative.</i>

926
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:27,854
- What eventually happened to NeXT?
- Apple purchased it.

927
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:33,280
- OK, when?
- I believe 1997.

928
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:37,914
<i>When Apple bought NeXT,
Apple was pretty messed up.</i>

929
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,782
<i>It was pretty easy to see.</i>

930
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:41,034
Apple Computer,

931
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:43,456
a pioneer in the personal computers
and software business,

932
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:44,874
has fallen on hard times.

933
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,338
<i>Over a three-month period,</i>

934
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:50,426
<i>Apple's profits plunged
by more than $50 million.</i>

935
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:54,388
<i>With big losses in the last
quarter, with profit margins shrinking,</i>

936
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:56,633
<i>Apple seems destined for a takeover.</i>

937
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:59,636
<i>Steve Jobs co-founded Apple
with Steve Wozniak,</i>

938
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:02,354
<i>and on Friday,
Apple went to the well once again,</i>

939
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:04,223
<i>bringing Jobs back as a consultant,</i>

940
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:06,646
<i>writing one
of the most unlikely chapters ever</i>

941
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,477
<i>in the lore that is Silicon Valley.</i>

942
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:09,945
Steve.

943
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:23,951
<i>I joined the company
in February '97.</i>

944
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:27,455
After a couple of days there,
I was in complete shock.

945
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:33,511
The company was close to bankruptcy,
and it was total chaos.

946
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:36,802
<i>The NeXT acquisition
had just occurred,</i>

947
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,016
<i>and there were major changes
going on.</i>

948
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:43,642
<i>And Steve was involved at that point
in time, but on the margins.</i>

949
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,561
I haven't been back here
in over ten years,

950
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:50,437
so, yeah, it's an interesting feeling.

951
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:53,230
It's a little strange,
but not too strange.

952
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:54,823
<i>At some point in time,</i>

953
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,944
<i>the process was started
to look for a full-time CEO.</i>

954
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,321
<i>And at that point in time,
Steve got much more involved.</i>

955
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:01,743
<i>Now, he still wasn't the CEO.</i>

956
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:05,334
I don't think he was 100% sure
the company was savable yet,

957
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:08,045
and so I think he was
hedging his bets a little bit.

958
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:12,834
<i>He had to make a decision whether he
really wanted to take on that role</i>

959
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:16,303
<i>because being CEO of Apple
is an all-consuming role,</i>

960
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:18,923
<i>and I'm not sure Steve thought
that that's something</i>

961
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:23,223
<i>that he wanted to do for what
turned out to be the rest of his life.</i>

962
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:28,895
I took the title of Interim CEO
and agreed to come back for 90 days

963
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:32,737
to help recruit a full-time CEO.

964
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,237
How did that recruitment effort go?

965
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,076
I failed.

966
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:48,707
<i>You know, the real hero
of that early part of the story</i>

967
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,079
<i>is Fred Anderson.</i>

968
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:53,499
<i>Fred restructured the company
financially</i>

969
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:56,753
and bought us the time to build
the foundation for today's Apple.

970
01:06:56,888 --> 01:07:00,006
<i>And then Fred even had an impact
on the product strategy</i>

971
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,633
<i>because when Steve came back,</i>

972
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:06,558
the first major project we
started was a network computer.

973
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:09,724
That was kind of the rage at the time,
but it wasn't a consumer product at all.

974
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:11,563
<i>Fred kept going,
"You know, wait a minute,</i>

975
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,276
<i>we got to have a consumer product."</i>

976
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,111
<i>"You guys have to focus
on a low-end Mac</i>

977
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,489
because that's what's going to
turn the company around."

978
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:21,618
<i>So, the executive team and Steve
decided that we would switch</i>

979
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:26,411
<i>from doing the network computer
and make that the iMac.</i>

980
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:29,414
There you go, right here.
Can you see it?

981
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:33,964
<i>♪ She comes in colors everywhere</i>

982
01:07:34,092 --> 01:07:37,426
In the world of computers,
it's kill or be killed.

983
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:40,388
And the original whiz kid was thought
to be dying an early death.

984
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:44,134
We went for colors that really expressed
the spirit of the machine.

985
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:47,220
And that is... you know,
it's powerful, but fun.

986
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:52,474
<i>And the first thing
I thought I'd do is give you an update.</i>

987
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:56,108
<i>We've managed to go from losing
a billion dollars the year before</i>

988
01:07:56,239 --> 01:08:01,234
<i>to actually making over $200 million
during the first three quarters.</i>

989
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:03,326
Boy, what a difference a year makes.

990
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:05,696
Guess what? Mac is back.

991
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:11,376
<i>♪ She comes in colors everywhere</i>

992
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,496
<i>♪ She combs her hair</i>

993
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,873
<i>♪ She's like a rainbow</i>

994
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:19,969
He was the kind of person that
could convince himself of things

995
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,588
that weren't necessarily true.

996
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:26,217
<i>He could go to people
and ask them to do something</i>

997
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:28,477
<i>that they thought was impossible.</i>

998
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:32,727
<i>Steve did create
reality distortion around him.</i>

999
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:35,021
You know, if he told you
the sky was green, for a while,

1000
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:37,145
you'd kind of go, "Yeah, OK.
Yeah, the sky's green."

1001
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:45,282
To me... marketing is about values.

1002
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:50,371
This is a very complicated world.
It's a very noisy world.

1003
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:53,790
And we're not going to get a chance

1004
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:59,417
to get people to remember much
about us. No company is.

1005
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,587
And so, we have to be really clear

1006
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:05,055
on what we want them to know
about us.

1007
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:07,391
Our customers want to know
who is Apple

1008
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:09,384
and what is it that we stand for.

1009
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:15,312
What we have is something
that I am...

1010
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:17,901
I am very moved by.

1011
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,815
<i>Here's to the crazy ones.</i>

1012
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:25,283
<i>Jobs was so moved
by the ad he'd commissioned</i>

1013
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:28,988
<i>that he produced a version where
he did the voiceover himself.</i>

1014
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:32,457
<i>The round pegs in the square holes.</i>

1015
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:35,874
<i>The ones
who see things differently.</i>

1016
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:40,466
<i>They're not fond of rules, and they
have no respect for the status quo.</i>

1017
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:47,595
<i>You can quote them, disagree with them,
glorify or vilify them.</i>

1018
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:51,059
<i>About the only thing
you can't do is ignore them</i>

1019
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,099
<i>because they change things.</i>

1020
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:59,353
<i>While some may see them
as the crazy ones, we see genius.</i>

1021
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:04,190
<i>Because the people who are crazy enough
to think they can change the world...</i>

1022
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,818
<i>are the ones who do.</i>

1023
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:15,702
It honors those people
who have changed the world.

1024
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:21,257
Some of them are living,
some of them are not.

1025
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:26,925
But the ones that aren't, you know
that if they ever used a computer,

1026
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,217
it would have been a Mac.

1027
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:34,846
The theme of the campaign is
"Think different."

1028
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,145
<i>Think different.</i>

1029
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:41,815
<i>In one brilliant, ungrammatical phrase,</i>

1030
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:47,863
<i>Jobs told a story of rebellion,
the triumph of the iconoclastic genius.</i>

1031
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:51,829
<i>With "Think different," was Jobs
trying to frame his own story?</i>

1032
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:55,412
<i>More than a CEO,
he positioned himself as an oracle,</i>

1033
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:58,877
<i>a man who could tell the future
of technology.</i>

1034
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,839
<i>You know, a lot of times,</i>

1035
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:16,141
<i>great products are sort of convergence
of the right set of technologies.</i>

1036
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:19,686
<i>And Steve was brilliant
at getting to a fork in the road</i>

1037
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:22,434
<i>and choosing the right fork.</i>

1038
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:26,322
We got a chance to play
with a variety of music players,

1039
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:28,236
and they sucked.

1040
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:32,653
<i>So, we decided, Steve said,
you know, "Go build a music player."</i>

1041
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:37,033
So, I assembled a small team to take
a look at what it would take to do it,

1042
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:40,627
and the conclusion was the technology
really wasn't ready yet.

1043
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:44,169
<i>Then in February of 2001,</i>

1044
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,509
<i>the Toshiba guys brought out
the 1.8-inch hard drive.</i>

1045
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:48,923
So, as soon as I saw that I go,

1046
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:51,138
"That's what we need
to build the iPod."

1047
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:55,259
<i>So, I went to Steve, and I go,
"OK, I know how to do it now."</i>

1048
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,805
<i>"I need $10 million."</i>

1049
01:11:56,938 --> 01:12:00,431
<i>And Steve goes, "OK,
I'll write you a $10 million check."</i>

1050
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:03,646
I went to Fred to make sure
the check wouldn't bounce,

1051
01:12:03,778 --> 01:12:06,270
and Fred said, "Yeah, you know, go."

1052
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,567
<i>And so I started ramping the team up,</i>

1053
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:12,568
<i>and, you know, we delivered
the iPod later that year.</i>

1054
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:16,955
<i>♪ One, two, three, four</i>

1055
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:19,040
<i>♪ Tell me that you love me more</i>

1056
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,285
<i>♪ Sleepless long nights</i>

1057
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,377
<i>♪ That is what my youth was for</i>

1058
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:25,463
<i>♪ Oh, oh, oh</i>

1059
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:27,966
<i>♪ You're changing your heart</i>

1060
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:29,801
<i>♪ Oh, oh, oh</i>

1061
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:32,179
<i>♪ You know who you are</i>

1062
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:34,389
<i>♪ One, two, three, four</i>

1063
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,224
<i>♪ Tell me that you love me more</i>

1064
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:38,514
<i>♪ Sleepless long nights</i>

1065
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:40,600
<i>♪ That is what my youth was for</i>

1066
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:43,189
<i>♪ Oh, teenage hopes</i>

1067
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:49,939
<i>Jobs's genius
was how he sold the iPod.</i>

1068
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:53,738
<i>It wasn't a machine for you.
It was you.</i>

1069
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:59,286
<i>People sometimes forget
that they're very unique</i>

1070
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:03,161
<i>and that they have very unique
feelings and perspectives.</i>

1071
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,790
You know,
the whole computer industry

1072
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:09,292
wants to forget about the humanist side
and just focus on the technology,

1073
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:12,340
but we think there's
a whole other side to the coin,

1074
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:14,554
which is what do you do
with these things?

1075
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:18,684
Can we do more than just spreadsheets
and word processors?

1076
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:21,804
Can we help you express yourself
in richer ways?

1077
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:29,069
<i>Apple at the core, its core value,</i>

1078
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:33,566
<i>is that we believe
that people with passion</i>

1079
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:35,860
<i>can change the world for the better.</i>

1080
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:37,952
That's what we believe.

1081
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:42,248
<i>Steve talks a lot
about the values of the company.</i>

1082
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:44,208
<i>And said that Apple was a company</i>

1083
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:47,250
<i>that was designed
to make the world a better place.</i>

1084
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:50,044
Was that a heartfelt thing for Steve?

1085
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:52,543
I believe it was
a heartfelt thing for Steve.

1086
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,303
I think that he did want to make
the world a better place.

1087
01:13:55,514 --> 01:14:00,054
I think that he felt
by delivering great products

1088
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:03,805
that were easy to use and beautiful,

1089
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:06,398
that it would
make people's lives better.

1090
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,361
<i>Is that enough?</i>

1091
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:15,108
<i>Is making and selling products,
even if they're good,</i>

1092
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:18,861
<i>even if they're the best, enough
to make the world a better place?</i>

1093
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,201
<i>Apple's a business.</i>

1094
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:25,497
And we've somehow attached
this emotion to a business,

1095
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:29,330
which is just there to make money
for its shareholders, right?

1096
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:30,922
That's all it is. Nothing more.

1097
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,882
<i>You know, creating that association</i>

1098
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:36,508
<i>was probably one of Steve's
greatest accomplishments.</i>

1099
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:39,006
- It's queued up to play.
- Awesome.

1100
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:45,771
I remember at this point, when the music
plays in the beginning,

1101
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:47,560
there's just this energy, right?

1102
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:52,524
You have on the one side
this huge bank of photographers,

1103
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:56,569
<i>and I remember
looking at all these guys</i>

1104
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:59,234
with their cameras trained on Steve,
thinking,

1105
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:02,113
"You guys have no idea
what's about to happen."

1106
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:03,955
And to be fair, neither did we.

1107
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:09,586
Thank you for coming.

1108
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,917
We're going to make some history
together today.

1109
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,757
<i>Any time you see an Apple event,</i>

1110
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:18,925
know that there's a team of people
in the audience who are just sick.

1111
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:26,391
We are calling it "iPhone."

1112
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:34,812
Today... Today,
Apple is going to reinvent the phone.

1113
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:38,691
And so, rather than talk about this
some more, let me show it to you.

1114
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:42,908
<i>So, if you're giving a demo,
and you deviate off the script,</i>

1115
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:44,496
<i>well, lots of bad things
can go wrong.</i>

1116
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:48,367
When Steve comes up with,
"Here's what I want to show,"

1117
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:49,993
everything is dissected.

1118
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:51,503
The message that he's trying to say

1119
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:53,587
is then dissected
into very specific actions.

1120
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:57,710
And let me go ahead and get
that picture within picture up.

1121
01:15:57,887 --> 01:16:01,051
I'm going to go ahead and just push
the "sleep wake" button.

1122
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:03,094
There we go, right there.

1123
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:06,559
And to unlock the phone, I just take
my finger and slide it across.

1124
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:09,145
All right, you want to see that again?

1125
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:14,025
<i>So, he's got, you know,
several discrete parts of the demo.</i>

1126
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:20,028
We had a flask of Scotch with us,
and after every little part,

1127
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:23,994
the person who was responsible for
that portion, you know, took a hit.

1128
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:26,488
I want to make a call to Jony Ive.

1129
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:27,914
I can just push here,

1130
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:30,580
and I see Jony Ive's contacts
with all his information.

1131
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:33,419
The Jony Ive call, oh, my God.

1132
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:36,460
<i>There's all sorts of ways that
this could have gone sideways.</i>

1133
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:39,926
- Hey, Jony, how you doing?
<i>- I'm good. How you doing?</i>

1134
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:44,640
Well, it's been two-and-a-half years,
and I can't tell you how thrilled I am

1135
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:47,555
to make the first public phone call
with iPhone.

1136
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:51,934
He goes to the music.

1137
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:54,274
Let's go into Dylan here.

1138
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:56,313
Let's play <i>Like a Rolling Stone.</i>

1139
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:00,605
He gets the web browser up there.

1140
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:04,234
I want to show you Safari
running on a mobile device.

1141
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:06,532
So, let's go to the web. Boom.

1142
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:08,326
Unbelievable.

1143
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:11,120
And then at the end,
he has that moment

1144
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:13,289
where he swizzles it all together.

1145
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:17,004
<i>At the end, where he orders thousands
of lattes from some, you know,</i>

1146
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:19,420
<i>poor woman at a Starbucks
down the road.</i>

1147
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,965
<i>Good morning. This is Starbucks
and how can I help you?</i>

1148
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:24,554
Yes, I'd liked to order
4,000 lattes to go, please.

1149
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:26,093
No, just kidding.

1150
01:17:26,225 --> 01:17:29,639
Wrong number. Thank you. Bye-bye.

1151
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,477
OK.

1152
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:41,275
As soon as the demo was over,
we left.

1153
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:46,243
And we just turned San Francisco
into a... It was a shit show.

1154
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:55,498
That was a night to remember.

1155
01:17:56,672 --> 01:18:00,211
<i>Man, you just had this release
of years of anxiety.</i>

1156
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:03,585
And then we got up tomorrow,
the next day, and did it all over again.

1157
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:05,587
And we had to finish the product
at this point.

1158
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:08,302
And that was tough,
especially with a raging hangover,

1159
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,346
but it was a lot of fun.

1160
01:18:10,477 --> 01:18:14,312
The biggest thing he made was
the iPhone, definitely.

1161
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,976
He made the iPhone,

1162
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:19,769
which shocked the world
with its touch screen and stuff.

1163
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:28,820
So, what are we down to?
13 minutes and...

1164
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:30,407
Whoo-hoo!

01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,077

Oh, I'm very sorry,
but we are currently sold out.

1183
01:20:12,516 --> 01:20:16,681
However, we did finally get
some more HTC Evos in.

1184
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,771
What? What is that?
Is it an iPhone?

1185
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:22,686
No, it is that 4G phone on Sprint.

1186
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,231
If it's not an iPhone,
why would I want it?

1187
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:28,355
Well, it's similar to an iPhone,
but has a bigger screen.

1188
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:29,651
I don't care.

1189
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:32,446
The internet speeds
are around three times faster.

1190
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:35,195
- I don't care.
- It fucking prints money.

1191
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:38,244
- I don't care.
- It can grant up to three wishes.

1192
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:40,833
Even if one of those wishes
is for an iPhone.

1193
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:43,453
- I don't care about any of that.
- OK, fine.

1194
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:46,457
Then what the hell entices you

if you don't mind me asking?

1196
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,384
It is an iPhone.

1197
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:05,192
<i>I remember the first set of
people I interviewed about the iPhone.</i>

1198
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:07,902
<i>I've been interviewing people
about their computers</i>

1199
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,987
<i>for, you know, decades.</i>

1200
01:21:10,157 --> 01:21:16,324
<i>I've never seen this kind of connection
before with an object.</i>

1201
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:21,909
<i>In the beginning,
the impulse was to sit you down</i>

1202
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:25,754
<i>and to show you everything
on their iPhone.</i>

1203
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:29,548
<i>As time's gone on,
there's been less of that</i>

1204
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:34,341
<i>and more of what I call
the "alone together phenomenon."</i>

1205
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:42,016
It has turned out to be
an isolating technology.

1213
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:20,721
<i>It's a little bit like that.</i>

1214
01:22:20,853 --> 01:22:24,938
<i>It's a dream machine,

1215

01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:22,825
you have a six-month grace period
to put license plates on.

1223
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:28,543
And so he leased the same car
every six months,

1224
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:30,832

at all.

1225

01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:39,425
Well, there's nothing more identifiable

1228
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:41,889

<i>A counter-culture businessman.

<i>or the right to have power

like 20 minutes later,

1261

into my little spiel that I had planned,

1264
01:25:56,735 --> 01:26:00,854

I just stopped. I'm like...

1266

1270
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:18,333
And at the end, he says,
"If you choose to leave my family,"

1271
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:23,172
should you decide to take so much
as one member of my family away from me,

1272
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:25,420
"I will personally take you down."

1289
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:22,856
<i>received this threat from Jobs,</i>

1290
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:28,529
<i>Google circulated a "do not cold
call" list that included Apple.</i>

1291
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:31,198
<i>Two years later, Google tried again,</i>

1292
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:34,197
<i>and Jobs e-mailed Google CEO
Eric Schmidt</i>

1293
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:36,745
<i>to remind him of their
gentlemen's agreement.</i>

1294
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:41,587
<i>Schmidt placated Jobs by assuring him</i>

1295
01:27:41,715 --> 01:27:45,584
<i>that the culprit would be fired
within the hour.</i>

1296
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:48,427
<i>When Jobs learned
that the woman had been canned,</i>

1297
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:52,390
<i>he showed his pleasure
in two efficient keystrokes.</i>

1298
01:27:58,023 --> 01:28:01,266
Someone's going to come out
of the door. Do we want a shot of that?

1299
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:08,022
Are you taking a picture
of the inside?

1300
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:10,616
We're taking a picture
of the Apple logo on the door.

1301
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:14,203
OK, we cannot have people
taking pictures.

1302
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:16,072
<i>Tonight, a Wall Street scandal</i>

1303
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:19,042
<i>has reached deep into
an iconic American company,</i>

1304
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:20,705
<i>the Apple Corporation.</i>

1305
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:23,295
It all centers on an alleged scheme

1306
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:27,667
to under-report Apple's expenses
by $40 million,

1307
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:29,544
including $20 million

1308
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:33,218
that went straight to the company's
celebrity CEO Steve Jobs,

1309
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:38,227
<i>in the form of what are known
as backdated options.</i>

1310
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:42,895
I first met Steve Jobs shortly after
I became editor of <i>Fortune</i> magazine.

1311
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:46,652
<i>"And I said," Listen, we'd love to have
a good relationship with Apple</i>

1312
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:47,780
<i>and do stories about you."</i>

1313
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:50,489
And he said, "Look,
this is how it's going to work."

1314
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:52,779
"You know,
you want to do a story about us,

1315
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:56,780
you call us up, propose it,
you know, we'll think about it."

1316
01:28:56,915 --> 01:28:59,783
"We'll basically
come up with the ideas with you,"

1317
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:02,160
or come up with the ideas,
we'll call you,

1318
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:06,960
"we'll figure out who the writer is going
to be on your staff to do the story."

1319
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:11,211
And I said, "Well, you know, Steve,
that's not really how we do things."

1320
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:13,429
And he goes, "That's how
you do things with Apple."

1321
01:29:14,432 --> 01:29:15,432
<i>So I say to myself,</i>

1322
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:18,601
<i>"Why don't we do a story
about the stock options?"</i>

1323
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:21,095
<i>"Because no one's
really figured it out."</i>

1324
01:29:21,231 --> 01:29:25,851
So, I decided to put one of our top
investigative reporters on the story,

1325
01:29:25,986 --> 01:29:26,986
Peter Elkind.

1326
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:30,526
Steve Jobs had a very talented group
of key lieutenants around him.

1327
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:34,989
<i>And he wanted give his people stock
option grants that were so big,</i>

1328
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,328
<i>that they wouldn't even think about
going somewhere else</i>

1329
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:39,367
<i>because the upside was so enormous.</i>

1330
01:29:39,499 --> 01:29:44,619
The key thing is if the stock goes up,

1331
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:47,872
which we always hope it does,

1332
01:29:48,008 --> 01:29:53,299
then the golden handcuffs are
dramatically increased,

1333
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:56,639
which is what I was hoping
would happen.

1334
01:29:57,517 --> 01:29:59,725
<i>To make those option deals
even sweeter,</i>

1335
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:04,063
<i>companies would allow executives
to buy stock on dates in the past</i>

1336
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:05,351
<i>when the price was low</i>

1337
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:08,442
<i>so executives could make
millions in the blink of an eye.</i>

1338
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:10,357
<i>This was called "backdating."</i>

1339
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:12,320
<i>And it seemed like
the perfect solution,</i>

1340
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:13,532
<i>except for one thing.</i>

1341
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:16,943
<i>If not properly reported,
backdating is illegal.</i>

1342
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:20,571
200 US public companies
are under investigation

1343
01:30:20,749 --> 01:30:24,914
over charges of backdated stock options
for their senior executives.

1344
01:30:26,296 --> 01:30:28,128
<i>Backdating was a dicey game,</i>

1345
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:30,919
<i>and it landed several executives
in jail for fraud,</i>

1346
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:34,544
<i>but it became a frequent practice
at Apple under Jobs.</i>

1347
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:37,134
<i>Apple eventually conducted
an internal investigation</i>

1348
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:38,551
<i>and found thousands of cases</i>

1349
01:30:38,725 --> 01:30:40,933
<i>where stock options had been
handled inappropriately.</i>

1350
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:43,599
None of that had taken place
according to the company's own report

1351
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:46,063
before Steve Jobs had returned there.

1352
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:49,229
<i>A key advisor on many of
the troubled backdating schemes</i>

1353
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:52,980
<i>was a powerful Silicon Valley attorney,
Larry Sonsini.</i>

1354
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:55,197
<i>Larry Sonsini had kind of</i>

1355
01:30:55,325 --> 01:30:57,487
spread this dark art
in the world of Silicon Valley.

1356
01:30:57,619 --> 01:31:01,363
<i>He's the guy who whispered to the CEOs
of all the top tech companies,</i>

1357
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:03,030
<i>"Here's how you can do this."</i>

1358
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:05,909
<i>He was certainly very close
to Steve Jobs.</i>

1359
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:09,537
<i>Sonsini had known Jobs
since Apple went public in 1980</i>

1360
01:31:09,714 --> 01:31:13,298
<i>and had been a board member at Pixar
when it created a vast program</i>

1361
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:16,635
<i>of brazenly backdated options
for top executives.</i>

1362
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:19,593
<i>Yet despite Jobs's long history
with backdating,</i>

1363
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:23,092
<i>Apple's own investigation,
led by Al Gore,</i>

1364
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:26,016
<i>absolved Jobs of any wrongdoing.</i>

1365
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:28,855
<i>Their conclusion was that
Steve Jobs didn't appreciate</i>

1366
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:31,522
<i>the accounting implications
of the issue.</i>

1367
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:34,817
I know you're not an accountant,
but do you have an understanding

1368
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:38,609
as to what generally accepted
accounting principles are?

1369
01:31:38,785 --> 01:31:40,447
Not really.

1370
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:42,410
<i>Jobs's accounting naiveté</i>

1371
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:45,407
<i>would be challenged by
his own CFO, Fred Anderson.</i>

1372
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:48,000
<i>A hero during Apple's comeback,</i>

1373
01:31:48,128 --> 01:31:52,623
<i>Anderson was one exec who
took the fall for backdating.</i>

1374
01:31:52,799 --> 01:31:55,917
As Apple's chief financial officer,
Mr Anderson,

1375
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:59,295
you had overall responsibility
to ensure that the company

1376
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:03,095
complied with all financial
reporting requirements, true?

1377
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:05,343
On advice of council,

1378
01:32:05,478 --> 01:32:09,563
I decline to answer based
on my Fifth Amendment rights.

1379
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:11,273
<i>When the SEC investigated,</i>

1380
01:32:11,401 --> 01:32:14,610
<i>Apple effectively
threw Anderson under the bus.</i>

1381
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:17,112
<i>He was forced to resign
from Apple's board</i>

1382
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:20,404
<i>and to pay $3.6 million in penalties.</i>

1383
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:24,279
<i>But in a very unusual statement,
Anderson's lawyer made it clear</i>

1384
01:32:24,414 --> 01:32:28,829
<i>that Fred had relied on statements
by Jobs that turned out to be false</i>

1385
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,829
<i>and that Anderson had explained
the dangers of backdating to Jobs.</i>

1386
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:37,550
Now, this contradicted exactly what
Jobs and the company had maintained

1387
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:40,215
which was that Steve Jobs didn't
appreciate why this was a problem.

1388
01:32:40,346 --> 01:32:42,929
<i>I think the notion
that Steve Jobs knew nothing</i>

1389
01:32:43,058 --> 01:32:45,596
<i>and Fred Anderson and Nancy Heinen
were entirely responsible</i>

1390
01:32:45,852 --> 01:32:46,852
<i>is ridiculous.</i>

1391
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:49,345
<i>The company has confirmed</i>

1392
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:52,474
<i>that Jobs himself
was awarded backdated options</i>

1393
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:55,602
<i>that carried a false date
in October 2001.</i>

1394
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:58,571
<i>According to Apple's own report
to the SEC,</i>

1395
01:32:58,698 --> 01:33:03,159
<i>"The award was" improperly recorded
as occurring at a special board meeting</i>

1396
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:06,870
<i>when in fact such a board meeting
did not occur."</i>

1397
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:12,960
<i>A fictitious board meeting
that awarded Jobs 7.5 million options.</i>

1398
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:15,045
<i>Just what was going on?</i>

1399
01:33:15,173 --> 01:33:17,165
<i>At first, all fingers pointed</i>

1400
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:19,963
<i>to another member
of the Apple comeback team,</i>

1401
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:21,757
<i>General Counsel Nancy Heinen,</i>

1402
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:25,514
<i>who had certified the minutes
of the phony board meeting.</i>

1403
01:33:25,642 --> 01:33:28,885
<i>Like Anderson,
Heinen would settle with the SEC</i>

1404
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:31,683
<i>without admitting or denying guilt.</i>

1405
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:37,147
<i>But her silence raised questions.
Would she have just decided on her own</i>

1406
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:41,898
<i>to fake a board meeting
in order to enrich Steve Jobs?</i>

1407
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:44,070
<i>Who wanted this done?</i>

1408
01:33:45,578 --> 01:33:51,074
As we've seen in the discussions
of the past hour,

1409
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:55,954
I spent a lot of time trying
to take care of people at Apple

1410
01:33:56,089 --> 01:34:02,962
and to, you know,
surprise and delight them

1411
01:34:03,096 --> 01:34:08,342
with what a career at Apple
could mean to them and their families.

1412
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:13,350
And I felt that the board wasn't
really doing the same with me.

1413
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:17,316
- Right.
- So I was...

1414
01:34:20,697 --> 01:34:24,566
hurt, I suppose would be
the most accurate word.

1415
01:34:24,701 --> 01:34:27,990
I'd been working, you know,
I don't know,

1416
01:34:28,121 --> 01:34:30,613
four years, five years of my life,

1417
01:34:30,748 --> 01:34:34,583
and not seeing my family
very much and stuff.

1418
01:34:34,711 --> 01:34:37,169
And I just felt like

1419
01:34:37,297 --> 01:34:40,131
there's nobody looking out
for me here, you know?

1420
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:41,419
Right. OK.

1421
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:47,843
So, I wanted them to do something,
and so we talked about it.

1422
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:51,134
<i>There's no question that
the directives came from him.</i>

1423
01:34:51,269 --> 01:34:53,602
<i>Yet, when the SEC investigated,</i>

1424
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:56,973
it was as if he was immune.

1425
01:34:58,026 --> 01:35:01,940
I'd wished they'd have come to me
and said,

1426
01:35:02,071 --> 01:35:05,690
"Steve, we've got this new grant
for you,"

1427
01:35:05,825 --> 01:35:08,693
without me having to suggest anything

1428
01:35:08,828 --> 01:35:12,947
or be involved in anything
or negotiate anything.

1429
01:35:13,082 --> 01:35:16,120
That would have been much better
from the company's point of view

1430
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:23,045
because it would have made me
feel better at that time.

1431
01:35:24,886 --> 01:35:26,673
<i>According to one analyst,</i>

1432
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:28,761
<i>if Jobs had gone to jail
for backdating,</i>

1433
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:32,850
<i>the company's value would have
dropped by $22 billion.</i>

1434
01:35:35,521 --> 01:35:37,979
<i>But Jobs was Apple's indispensable man,</i>

1435
01:35:38,107 --> 01:35:43,353
<i>and Apple, Silicon Valley's
indispensable company.</i>

1436
01:35:43,488 --> 01:35:46,981
<i>A cornerstone
of the entire American economy.</i>

1437
01:35:47,116 --> 01:35:49,859
<i>But just how American was Apple?</i>

1438
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:54,239
Do you swear that the testimony
you're about to give will be...

1439
01:35:54,374 --> 01:35:56,832
<i>When the US Senate
questioned Jobs's successor,</i>

1440
01:35:57,001 --> 01:35:59,493
<i>Tim Cook,
about the company's tax practices,</i>

1441
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:03,088
<i>many of the subcommittee members
took a moment to state,</i>

1442
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:08,086
<i>for the record, just how tough
they were willing to be.</i>

1443
01:36:08,221 --> 01:36:13,762
I love Apple, and I'm very proud
of Apple as an American company.

1444
01:36:13,893 --> 01:36:17,307
Apple is an American success story.

1445
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:22,392
Its products are justifiably well-known
and used throughout the world.

1446
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:25,861
Just like millions around the world,
I carry an iPhone in my pocket.

1447
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:27,862
What may not be so well-known

1448
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:32,402
is that Apple also has a highly
developed tax-avoidance system,

1449
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:36,577
a system through which it has
amassed more than $100 billion

1450
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:39,621
in off-shore cash in a tax haven.

1451
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:45,164
<i>Apple found its tax haven
in the green fields of Ireland</i>

1452
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:49,294
<i>where Jobs and his team set up
holding companies in the early 1980s.</i>

1453
01:36:49,429 --> 01:36:52,467
<i>The scheme is known as
a "Double Irish".</i>

1454
01:36:53,683 --> 01:36:55,390
<i>Holly Hill industrial estate</i>

1455
01:36:55,518 --> 01:36:58,226
<i>can scarcely be compared
to California's Silicon Valley.</i>

1456
01:36:58,354 --> 01:37:02,564
<i>There is the feeling that Apple of Cork
may become something of a Silicon Hill.</i>

1457
01:37:07,405 --> 01:37:12,946
<i>Today, Apple holds more than
$137 billion of its profits overseas.</i>

1458
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:18,080
<i>Much of it in two small Irish
companies, one with no employees.</i>

1459
01:37:18,207 --> 01:37:22,372
<i>While the actual cash is held
and invested by New York banks,</i>

1460
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:26,338
<i>the paper profits are steered
through an office park in Reno, Nevada,</i>

1461
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:31,257
<i>and then back to the Emerald Isle
where it's taxed at rates less than 1%.</i>

1462
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:34,596
Senator, we're proud
that all of our R&D,

1463
01:37:34,724 --> 01:37:36,807
or the vast majority of it,
is in the United States.

1464
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:40,018
I know, but the profits that
result from it are sitting in Ireland

1465
01:37:40,188 --> 01:37:43,852
in corporations that you control
that don't pay taxes.

1466
01:37:44,025 --> 01:37:48,486
Part of the mythology
of these new companies

1467
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:53,699
<i>was that they in some way reflected
something about America.</i>

1468
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:58,829
<i>Both Google and Apple
have played on the idea</i>

1469
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:02,245
<i>of political virtue as part
of selling their company.</i>

1470
01:38:02,377 --> 01:38:09,170
So then to find out they weren't about
political virtue is distressing.

1471
01:38:14,055 --> 01:38:19,016
<i>Steve Jobs said he wanted
to change the world, but into what?</i>

1472
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:23,763
<i>Companies all over the world
make choices on how to treat workers,</i>

1473
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:26,891
<i>what to give back
and where to put their money.</i>

1474
01:38:27,026 --> 01:38:29,188
<i>What were Steve's choices?</i>

1475
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:32,438
<i>In meditation, he found simplicity.</i>

1476
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:38,194
<i>He loved the idea of "Be Here Now."
But where was "here?"</i>

1477
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:42,865
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we have just landed</i>

1478
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,084
<i>at Beijing International Airport.</i>

1479
01:38:53,469 --> 01:38:56,678
<i>I thought it was important
to cover China</i>

1480
01:38:56,806 --> 01:39:01,267
because Apple has
all of its products made there.

1481
01:39:01,394 --> 01:39:04,307
<i>I mean,
they design their own products,</i>

1482
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:06,772
<i>but the manufacturing is done in China,</i>

1483
01:39:06,899 --> 01:39:10,768
<i>and so it's caught up in another
country's industrial revolution.</i>

1484
01:39:10,903 --> 01:39:13,646
And a lot of that is
out of Apple's control.

1485
01:39:19,662 --> 01:39:22,700
<i>Four workers died
and 77 were wounded</i>

1486
01:39:22,832 --> 01:39:25,916
<i>in explosions
at two Apple supplier factories</i>

1487
01:39:26,043 --> 01:39:28,126
<i>caused by careless safety procedures.</i>

1488
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:31,747
<i>The solvents used to sparkle
Apple's touch screens</i>

1489
01:39:31,883 --> 01:39:35,376
<i>were powerful but dangerous,
causing nerve damage</i>

1490
01:39:35,511 --> 01:39:39,425
<i>that led to weakness
and loss of touch in workers.</i>

1491
01:39:39,557 --> 01:39:44,302
<i>They complained about low wages
and pressure to meet Apple's deadlines.</i>

1492
01:39:45,354 --> 01:39:48,142
<i>In the Chinese factories
of many tech companies,</i>

1493
01:39:48,316 --> 01:39:50,273
<i>copper, chromium
and other heavy metals</i>

1494
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:54,361
<i>saturate the run-off that flows
into local waterways.</i>

1495
01:39:54,489 --> 01:39:56,651
<i>Sometimes chemical levels
are so high</i>

1496
01:39:56,782 --> 01:39:59,616
<i>that sewage treatment plants
can't adequately clean the water</i>

1497
01:39:59,744 --> 01:40:01,827
<i>for it ever to be used again.</i>

1498
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:09,411
<i>In 2010, Chinese activist Ma Jun
contacted all the tech manufacturers</i>

1499
01:40:09,545 --> 01:40:13,505
<i>to discuss the issue
and even wrote to Jobs personally.</i>

1500
01:40:13,633 --> 01:40:17,923
<i>All the companies ultimately responded
except one. Apple.</i>

1501
01:40:18,054 --> 01:40:20,717
<i>It wasn't until Jobs left the company</i>

1502
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:24,057
<i>that Apple even agreed
to speak to Ma Jun.</i>

1503
01:40:29,982 --> 01:40:32,269
<i>Foxconn is Apple's top supplier,</i>

1504
01:40:32,401 --> 01:40:36,771
so it all goes downhill from there
in terms of the standards,

1505
01:40:36,906 --> 01:40:38,488
in terms of everything.

1506
01:40:40,535 --> 01:40:43,653
<i>These young people
come from the countryside</i>

1507
01:40:43,788 --> 01:40:49,284
<i>under unimaginably poor conditions,
looking for a better life.</i>

1508
01:40:54,173 --> 01:40:56,916
<i>Sun Danyong, nicknamed Yong,</i>

1509
01:40:57,051 --> 01:40:59,839
<i>came to Foxconn
from a small mountain village.</i>

1510
01:41:02,473 --> 01:41:04,681
<i>Placed in the product
communications department,</i>

1511
01:41:04,809 --> 01:41:08,177
<i>he was responsible for the security
of iPhone prototypes</i>

1512
01:41:08,437 --> 01:41:10,929
<i>bound for Apple's headquarters
in Silicon Valley.</i>

1513
01:41:11,065 --> 01:41:17,357
<i>In 2009, an iPhone 4 prototype
went missing on Yong's watch.</i>

1514
01:41:24,745 --> 01:41:28,489
<i>Sun Danyong was
the first factory worker</i>

1515
01:41:28,624 --> 01:41:31,037
<i>who came under the spotlight.</i>

1516
01:41:31,168 --> 01:41:37,381
What makes his story incredibly vivid
is that in today's day and age,

1517
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:41,047
there's CCTV cameras recording
where his movements were.

1518
01:41:41,178 --> 01:41:45,798
<i>He had a conversation with his friends
on the Chinese Twitter site,</i>

1519
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:49,847
and you could really track
what had happened.

1520
01:41:50,855 --> 01:41:53,017
<i>Yong searched
high and low for the prototype</i>

1521
01:41:53,232 --> 01:41:56,396
<i>before reporting it missing
to Foxconn security.</i>

1522
01:41:57,111 --> 01:42:00,275
<i>That evening, officials took him
into an interrogation room</i>

1523
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:01,905
<i>where he was assaulted</i>

1524
01:42:02,033 --> 01:42:05,617
<i>and was told police would arrive
the next morning to question him.</i>

1525
01:42:06,662 --> 01:42:10,952
<i>Yong was finally permitted
to leave the factory at 10:41pm.</i>

1526
01:42:11,083 --> 01:42:13,450
<i>He wandered to an internet cafe</i>

1527
01:42:13,586 --> 01:42:16,795
<i>where he chatted online
with his friends.</i>

1528
01:42:32,772 --> 01:42:35,640
<i>He logged off
around 1:30 in the morning.</i>

1529
01:42:37,026 --> 01:42:39,894
<i>Soon after, security cameras
spotted him in an elevator</i>

1530
01:42:40,029 --> 01:42:42,817
<i>in his apartment complex.</i>

1531
01:42:42,948 --> 01:42:46,191
<i>He got out on the 12th floor
and texted his girlfriend.</i>

1532
01:43:02,927 --> 01:43:09,720
<i>At 3:33am, security cameras recorded
Sun Danyong jumping to his death.</i>

1533
01:43:15,648 --> 01:43:19,517
<i>Over a period of two years or so,
there were 18 suicides.</i>

1534
01:43:19,652 --> 01:43:24,989
Foxconn set up these nets
to catch people who fall off.

1535
01:43:25,116 --> 01:43:27,403
<i>People were jumping
off of the buildings,</i>

1536
01:43:27,535 --> 01:43:29,822
<i>so they were going to
prevent people from dying</i>

1537
01:43:29,954 --> 01:43:32,992
<i>by having safety nets to catch them.</i>

1538
01:43:38,963 --> 01:43:41,797
You know, they've had,
if you count the attempted suicides,

1539
01:43:41,924 --> 01:43:43,881
13 so far this year.

1540
01:43:44,009 --> 01:43:49,721
And while that is still...
They have 400,000 people at this place.

1541
01:43:49,849 --> 01:43:53,843
So, 13 out of 400,000
is 26 per year so far.

1542
01:43:53,978 --> 01:44:00,100
For 400,000 people or, you know,
let's say seven per 100,000 people,

1543
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:04,319
that's still under the US suicide rate
of 11 per 100,000 people,

1544
01:44:04,488 --> 01:44:06,104
but it's really troubling.

1545
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,152
Right. It's in one place, too.

1546
01:44:08,284 --> 01:44:10,697
Well, you measure it
by number of people.

1547
01:44:10,911 --> 01:44:14,825
You measure it by numbers of people.
So, we're all over this.

1548
01:44:14,957 --> 01:44:18,701
And it's... It's very troubling.

1549
01:44:18,836 --> 01:44:22,329
So, we're over there trying
to understand what's happening,

1550
01:44:22,506 --> 01:44:24,998
and more importantly,
trying to understand how we can help.

1551
01:44:31,015 --> 01:44:34,725
<i>Apple isn't the only company
to manufacture in China,</i>

1552
01:44:34,894 --> 01:44:38,808
<i>but it is different in one way.
Its enormous profit margin.</i>

1553
01:44:38,939 --> 01:44:43,024
<i>The profit on every iPhone 4
was over $300.</i>

1554
01:44:43,194 --> 01:44:48,110
<i>Yet Apple paid its Chinese workforce
less than $12 per phone.</i>

1555
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:51,950
<i>If Jobs had really "thought different,"
shouldn't he have cared more</i>

1556
01:44:52,077 --> 01:44:53,909
<i>about the people
who touched the iPhones</i>

1557
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:58,032
<i>before they appeared in
the hands of Apple's customers?</i>

1558
01:45:06,133 --> 01:45:09,968
<i>When I was writing
critical stories about Apple,</i>

1559
01:45:10,095 --> 01:45:13,259
the mail would be 80% hate mail.

1560
01:45:15,559 --> 01:45:21,146
<i>Even the most reasoned,
judicious criticism</i>

1561
01:45:21,273 --> 01:45:27,395
<i>about labor practices in China,
for crying out loud, it didn't matter.</i>

1562
01:45:27,571 --> 01:45:30,063
<i>People didn't want to hear it.</i>

1563
01:45:30,199 --> 01:45:33,943
<i>They loved this company.
They loved its products.</i>

1564
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:37,697
<i>They loved the status symbol
of having these things in their hand</i>

1565
01:45:37,832 --> 01:45:41,246
<i>and looking at it all the time,
and it just felt cool,</i>

1566
01:45:41,377 --> 01:45:46,122
<i>and they'd stood in line for two days
to buy one,</i>

1567
01:45:46,257 --> 01:45:48,670
<i>and they didn't want to hear it.</i>

1568
01:45:54,431 --> 01:45:57,765
<i>I was one of those people
who had to have an iPhone.</i>

1569
01:45:57,893 --> 01:46:00,601
<i>I didn't want
to hear about other products,</i>

1570
01:46:00,729 --> 01:46:02,470
<i>and I believed against all reason</i>

1571
01:46:02,648 --> 01:46:06,016
<i>that owning an iPhone made me
part of something better.</i>

1572
01:46:06,151 --> 01:46:09,986
<i>And when it was in my pocket,
for every idle moment,</i>

1573
01:46:10,114 --> 01:46:14,529
<i>my hand was drawn to it,
like Frodo's hand to the ring.</i>

1574
01:46:15,411 --> 01:46:18,404
<i>The real magic of it
is that these myths</i>

1575
01:46:18,539 --> 01:46:24,001
<i>are surrounding a company
that makes phones.</i>

1576
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:27,917
A phone is not a mythical device.

1577
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:31,083
Um...

1578
01:46:31,218 --> 01:46:38,842
And it sort of makes you wonder
less about Apple than about us.

1579
01:46:40,561 --> 01:46:43,850
<i>The myth-making
around technology in general</i>

1580
01:46:43,981 --> 01:46:50,854
<i>allows the technologist to do things
that would be viewed as heinous</i>

1581
01:46:50,988 --> 01:46:54,152
<i>if they were done
by other kinds of companies.</i>

1582
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:58,402
<i>This is a story that's amazing.</i>

1583
01:46:58,537 --> 01:47:03,032
<i>It's got theft, it's got buying
stolen property, it's got extortion.</i>

1584
01:47:03,167 --> 01:47:05,830
I'm sure there's sex
in there somewhere, you know?

1585
01:47:05,961 --> 01:47:07,327
Really?

1586
01:47:07,463 --> 01:47:10,456
So somebody should make
a movie out of this.

1587
01:47:10,591 --> 01:47:13,049
<i>If you were to make a movie
about it,</i>

1588
01:47:13,177 --> 01:47:16,670
<i>the first scene would be set in
a beer garden in Silicon Valley.</i>

1589
01:47:16,805 --> 01:47:19,593
<i>As he swilled a few steins of Pilsner,</i>

1590
01:47:19,767 --> 01:47:23,226
<i>Apple's Gray Powell was testing out
a new iPhone prototype.</i>

1591
01:47:25,105 --> 01:47:28,598
<i>But when Powell staggered
out of the bar, he forgot one thing.</i>

1592
01:47:28,776 --> 01:47:30,517
<i>The iPhone.</i>

1593
01:47:30,694 --> 01:47:35,814
<i>It was found on a bar stool
by a college student named Brian Hogan.</i>

1594
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:39,071
<i>And this e-mail
comes into our tip box,</i>

1595
01:47:39,203 --> 01:47:43,538
and there was this guy claiming
that he had this new iPhone prototype.

1596
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:47,872
<i>Getting inside Apple's security fort,</i>

1597
01:47:48,003 --> 01:47:50,461
<i>and look at something
that is under wrap.</i>

1598
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:54,424
But back then, when Steve Jobs was
at the helm and in his full power,

1599
01:47:54,551 --> 01:47:56,543
it was impossible
to get anything from them.

1600
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,632
It was incredibly exciting.

1601
01:47:58,806 --> 01:48:01,719
At that point, Apple didn't have
a whole lot of leaks.

1602
01:48:01,850 --> 01:48:04,843
And then I go to Nick and I say,

1603
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:08,063
"We think it's the real thing,
and they want their money."

1604
01:48:08,190 --> 01:48:10,182
And Nick said, "Anything you want."

1605
01:48:10,317 --> 01:48:14,106
For us, there's no question
as to whether we write the story or not.

1606
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:17,402
That's what was so disturbing,
I think, to Steve Jobs,

1607
01:48:17,533 --> 01:48:19,775
was that he'd been used to having

1608
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:22,323
a much more controlled
relationship with the press.

1609
01:48:22,454 --> 01:48:25,162
Our plan was to take pictures of it,

1610
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:28,499
write about it,
and then return it back to Apple.

1611
01:48:28,627 --> 01:48:31,165
Hey, I'm Jason Chen.
This is the new iPhone.

1612
01:48:31,296 --> 01:48:33,333
Here are some of the new features.

1613
01:48:33,465 --> 01:48:36,879
<i>In the beginning, it was OK.
Only nerds looking at it, I guess.</i>

1614
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:38,422
And then the story
started to pick up.

1615
01:48:40,514 --> 01:48:43,848
You know, it was the biggest
scoop in tech in history.

1616
01:48:46,228 --> 01:48:49,312
"Hi, this is Steve Jobs.
I want my phone back."

1617
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,557
And it was
in a really charming voice.

1618
01:48:51,692 --> 01:48:55,936
And it's same way you'd ask for,
you know, a hat you'd lent a friend.

1619
01:48:56,071 --> 01:49:00,782
<i>I'd met him a couple of times before.
It was his voice, unmistakably.</i>

1620
01:49:00,909 --> 01:49:02,400
He said, "You know, I'm not mad at you."

1621
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:04,573
"It's someone we worked with
who lost it."

1622
01:49:04,705 --> 01:49:06,697
"But you've had your fun,
and we need this phone back

1623
01:49:06,874 --> 01:49:08,490
before it gets into the wrong hands."

1624
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:12,118
And at that point, I was thinking,
"Isn't it already in the wrong hands?"

1625
01:49:17,551 --> 01:49:21,886
Nick at that moment said,
"Ask for a letter."

1626
01:49:22,014 --> 01:49:24,006
"Ask for an official letter
asking for it."

1627
01:49:24,141 --> 01:49:26,679
"We need the actual confirmation
that this is the real thing."

1628
01:49:26,894 --> 01:49:29,932
<i>The next call,
he said he didn't want to claim it.</i>

1629
01:49:30,064 --> 01:49:32,226
<i>He really changed his tone
at that point,</i>

1630
01:49:32,357 --> 01:49:34,974
<i>because it would affect
the sales of the current model,</i>

1631
01:49:35,194 --> 01:49:36,901
which is kind of disappointing,
you know?

1632
01:49:37,029 --> 01:49:39,521
You hear all these stories about
this guy not caring about money.

1633
01:49:39,656 --> 01:49:42,069
<i>And he goes,
"This is some serious shit."</i>

1634
01:49:42,201 --> 01:49:45,114
<i>"If I have to serve you papers,
I'm coming for something,</i>

1635
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:48,079
<i>and it's going to mean someone in your
organization is going to go to jail."</i>

1636
01:49:48,207 --> 01:49:51,291
For a reporter who's got a chip
on his shoulder against corporations,

1637
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:55,037
that's like,
"Martyr me. Please, martyr me."

1638
01:49:55,172 --> 01:49:59,257
"I'll go to jail for an iPhone.
Like, really."

1639
01:49:59,384 --> 01:50:03,219
<i>He called back later and he said,
"OK, we'll get you the letter,"</i>

1640
01:50:03,347 --> 01:50:05,555
<i>and he was just resigned and cold.</i>

1641
01:50:05,682 --> 01:50:08,720
<i>So, they sent us the letter,
and they sent a lawyer from Apple</i>

1642
01:50:08,894 --> 01:50:11,227
to Jason's house to pick up the phone.

1643
01:50:11,355 --> 01:50:13,563
It was a very cold exchange.

1644
01:50:13,732 --> 01:50:16,270
He said, "I believe you have
something of mine," or something.

1645
01:50:16,401 --> 01:50:19,485
And I handed it to him, and he said,
"Thank you very much," and he left.

1646
01:50:19,613 --> 01:50:22,481
Was that the end of it,
as far as Apple was concerned?

1647
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:23,948
No, of course not.

1648
01:50:24,076 --> 01:50:27,695
Then all the nightmares started.

1649
01:50:54,773 --> 01:50:58,517
The cops had to bash in the guy's door?

1650
01:50:58,652 --> 01:51:01,941
Don't they know there's an app for that?

1651
01:51:02,072 --> 01:51:04,439
<i>Anyone who'd worked
with Jobs before</i>

1652
01:51:04,575 --> 01:51:07,693
would know of other instances
where he'd been a bully.

1653
01:51:07,828 --> 01:51:10,616
But this was probably
the most public evidence of bullying.

1654
01:51:11,832 --> 01:51:15,451
<i>My wife and I went out for dinner.
We came back home,</i>

1655
01:51:15,586 --> 01:51:18,124
<i>and we noticed the garage door
was slightly opened.</i>

1656
01:51:18,255 --> 01:51:21,623
You know, and I was wondering,
"What's going on?"

1657
01:51:21,758 --> 01:51:24,501
<i>And I opened it all the way,
and I noticed there were people inside.</i>

1658
01:51:24,678 --> 01:51:28,171
<i>And I thought, you know,
"Holy crap, I'm being robbed."</i>

1659
01:51:28,307 --> 01:51:30,765
And then I looked closer
and realized it was cops.

1660
01:51:33,061 --> 01:51:35,769
<i>The cops seized boxes
of Chen's personal property</i>

1661
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:38,682
<i>including four computers,
two cellphones</i>

1662
01:51:38,817 --> 01:51:41,400
<i>and a box of his business cards.</i>

1663
01:51:43,155 --> 01:51:48,196
<i>For the Gizmodo movie, this raised
questions of plot and motivation.</i>

1664
01:51:48,327 --> 01:51:53,243
<i>Why break down Chen's door
after he returned the iPhone?</i>

1665
01:51:53,373 --> 01:51:57,413
<i>They showed me the warrant
to search the premises and said,</i>

1666
01:51:57,544 --> 01:51:59,331
"We're part of the REACT team."

1667
01:51:59,463 --> 01:52:02,581
<i>After they searched the house,
obviously I went and Googled it.</i>

1668
01:52:02,716 --> 01:52:04,753
<i>The officers
who raided Chen's apartment</i>

1669
01:52:04,885 --> 01:52:08,424
<i>were part of a little-known criminal
task force called REACT,</i>

1670
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:11,764
<i>composed of local, state
and federal officials</i>

1671
01:52:11,892 --> 01:52:15,385
<i>on the lookout for corporate espionage
in Silicon Valley.</i>

1672
01:52:17,397 --> 01:52:20,310
My initial response was,
"This is cool. It's Apple."

1673
01:52:21,401 --> 01:52:23,188
<i>Chris Feasel was the deputy DA</i>

1674
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:25,858
<i>advising REACT on the case.</i>

1675
01:52:26,031 --> 01:52:28,023
<i>After the raid on Chen's apartment,</i>

1676
01:52:28,158 --> 01:52:31,492
<i>Feasel was received at Apple
by Jobs himself.</i>

1677
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:35,660
He was very, very nice,
very high-energy.

1678
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:39,709
<i>We had a back-and-forth about
what he wanted to see happen</i>

1679
01:52:39,836 --> 01:52:42,328
<i>versus what some of the realities were
about doing a prosecution.</i>

1680
01:52:42,464 --> 01:52:46,583
He was very supportive about whatever
choices that we made on the case.

1681
01:52:46,718 --> 01:52:48,755
Where do people
come down on this?

1682
01:52:48,887 --> 01:52:51,800
- Where do you come down on it?
- Well, I can just tell you what...

1683
01:52:51,932 --> 01:52:58,270
There is an ongoing investigation
by the DA, and I'm not current on it.

1684
01:52:58,397 --> 01:53:01,936
He was very involved in it
and very interested in it

1685
01:53:02,067 --> 01:53:03,649
and wanted to be kept abreast

1686
01:53:03,777 --> 01:53:06,019
about what was going on
in the investigation.

1687
01:53:06,947 --> 01:53:10,440
<i>Jobs had every reason to
expect that he would be kept informed</i>

1688
01:53:10,575 --> 01:53:13,613
<i>because REACT wasn't
a purely government agency.</i>

1689
01:53:13,745 --> 01:53:15,077
<i>It had a steering committee</i>

1690
01:53:15,247 --> 01:53:19,207
<i>composed of many of the major
companies in the Valley.</i>

1691
01:53:19,376 --> 01:53:22,790
<i>In a town so completely dominated
by the tech industry,</i>

1692
01:53:22,921 --> 01:53:25,288
<i>had law enforcement become the muscle</i>

1693
01:53:25,424 --> 01:53:27,837
<i>for the largest corporations
in the world?</i>

1694
01:53:31,263 --> 01:53:38,352
<i>He was very, very adamant
and very passionate about his creation.</i>

1695
01:53:38,478 --> 01:53:42,142
And the only analogy I can think of is
if somebody stole your baby,

1696
01:53:42,316 --> 01:53:44,182
you would be very upset about it.

1697
01:53:44,401 --> 01:53:48,862
<i>That's how Mr Jobs felt.
Somebody had taken his baby.</i>

1698
01:53:51,366 --> 01:53:53,323
<i>In spite of pressure from Apple,</i>

1699
01:53:53,452 --> 01:53:56,445
<i>the DA decided
not to pursue the charges against Chen</i>

1700
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:59,243
<i>because he hadn't received
stolen property.</i>

1701
01:53:59,374 --> 01:54:01,582
<i>He was a journalist doing a story.</i>

1702
01:54:02,961 --> 01:54:06,796
When this whole thing
with Gizmodo happened,

1703
01:54:06,923 --> 01:54:11,714
I got a lot of advice
from people that said,

1704
01:54:11,845 --> 01:54:18,137
"You shouldn't go after a journalist
because they bought stolen property,

1705
01:54:18,268 --> 01:54:22,558
and they tried to extort you.
You should let it slide."

1706
01:54:22,689 --> 01:54:27,104
"Apple's a big company now.
You don't want the PR."

1707
01:54:27,235 --> 01:54:29,192
"You should let it slide."

1708
01:54:29,321 --> 01:54:34,487
And I thought deeply about this,
and I ended up concluding

1709
01:54:34,618 --> 01:54:37,702
that the worst thing
that could possibly happen

1710
01:54:37,829 --> 01:54:42,324
as we get big and we get
a little more influence in the world,

1711
01:54:42,459 --> 01:54:48,877
is if we change our core values
and start letting it slide.

1712
01:54:49,049 --> 01:54:53,214
I can't do that. I'd rather quit.

1713
01:54:54,304 --> 01:54:57,342
<i>What values
was Jobs talking about?</i>

1714
01:54:57,474 --> 01:55:02,469
<i>When Apple was taking on IBM,
it was David versus Goliath.</i>

1715
01:55:02,646 --> 01:55:08,017
<i>But when Apple became Goliath,
to whom was Jobs giving the finger?</i>

1716
01:55:12,656 --> 01:55:17,492
<i>The sad thing is that how many
months did he have left after that?</i>

1717
01:55:17,619 --> 01:55:22,990
This was a guy who knew,
who knew at the time,

1718
01:55:23,166 --> 01:55:30,164
he was dying, and he dedicated,
what, ten minutes of his life

1719
01:55:30,298 --> 01:55:33,336
to talk about these guys
who found a phone in a bar

1720
01:55:33,468 --> 01:55:38,259
and then published a story about it?
Isn't that a little bit strange?

1721
01:55:41,435 --> 01:55:45,019
My third story is about death.

1722
01:55:46,064 --> 01:55:50,058
About a year ago,
I was diagnosed with cancer.

1723
01:55:50,235 --> 01:55:52,227
I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning,

1724
01:55:52,362 --> 01:55:55,446
and it clearly showed
a tumor on my pancreas.

1725
01:55:55,574 --> 01:55:57,566
I didn't even know
what a pancreas was.

1726
01:55:57,701 --> 01:55:59,283
The doctors told me

1727
01:55:59,411 --> 01:56:03,405
this was almost certainly
a type of cancer that is incurable,

1728
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:07,625
and that I should expect to live
no longer than three to six months.

1729
01:56:07,752 --> 01:56:12,338
My doctor advised me to go home
and get my affairs in order,

1730
01:56:12,507 --> 01:56:15,841
which is doctor's code
for "prepare to die."

1731
01:56:15,969 --> 01:56:17,756
It means to try and tell your kids

1732
01:56:17,888 --> 01:56:21,723
everything you thought you'd have
the next ten years to tell them

1733
01:56:21,850 --> 01:56:23,307
in just a few months.

1734
01:56:23,435 --> 01:56:28,601
I lived with that diagnosis all day.
Later that evening, I had a biopsy.

1735
01:56:28,732 --> 01:56:32,066
I was sedated, but my wife,
who was there,

1736
01:56:32,277 --> 01:56:35,441
told me that when they viewed the cells
under a microscope,

1737
01:56:35,572 --> 01:56:38,280
the doctors started crying
because it turned out to be

1738
01:56:38,408 --> 01:56:42,743
a very rare form of pancreatic cancer
that is curable with surgery.

1739
01:56:42,871 --> 01:56:46,490
I had the surgery
and, thankfully, I'm fine now.

1740
01:56:50,128 --> 01:56:52,836
<i>Steve Jobs talked about
his cancer very emotionally</i>

1741
01:56:52,964 --> 01:56:56,548
<i>at the Stanford graduation ceremony
in 2005.</i>

1742
01:56:56,676 --> 01:56:58,668
And he very clearly told the story

1743
01:56:58,803 --> 01:57:01,341
to make it sound as though
he had been diagnosed

1744
01:57:01,515 --> 01:57:04,303
and moved immediately to surgery,
and been cured.

1745
01:57:04,434 --> 01:57:05,720
That simply wasn't true.

1746
01:57:05,852 --> 01:57:09,436
<i>What I found out, over a period
of months of reporting,</i>

1747
01:57:09,564 --> 01:57:12,307
<i>was that Steve Jobs actually
had been diagnosed with cancer</i>

1748
01:57:12,442 --> 01:57:16,186
<i>nine months earlier, and that
for a period of nine months,</i>

1749
01:57:16,363 --> 01:57:19,822
<i>he had refused to have the surgery
that every medical expert said</i>

1750
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:22,613
<i>was necessary to increase
his prospects for survival.</i>

1751
01:57:22,744 --> 01:57:24,736
Instead of having the surgery,

1752
01:57:24,871 --> 01:57:28,581
he had sought
alternative medicine approaches

1753
01:57:28,708 --> 01:57:30,791
to try to cure himself of cancer.

1754
01:57:31,962 --> 01:57:34,705
<i>Entrepreneurs have
an almost pathological need</i>

1755
01:57:34,839 --> 01:57:36,751
<i>to control their own fate.</i>

1756
01:57:36,883 --> 01:57:38,169
<i>They'll take any suffering</i>

1757
01:57:38,301 --> 01:57:40,133
if they can just be in charge
of their destiny

1758
01:57:40,303 --> 01:57:42,295
and not have it
in somebody else's hands.

1759
01:57:42,430 --> 01:57:47,516
<i>Apple's stock has been
volatile on rumors about Jobs's health.</i>

1760
01:57:47,644 --> 01:57:49,852
The company's stock
was halted for a time,

1761
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:53,690
then took a big hit when it re-opened
in after-hours trading.

1762
01:57:53,817 --> 01:57:55,774
<i>Apple's share prices have dropped</i>

1763
01:57:55,902 --> 01:57:58,815
<i>with every pound
that Jobs has lost in recent months.</i>

1764
01:58:00,198 --> 01:58:02,656
<i>Apple really landed
into a dicey situation</i>

1765
01:58:02,784 --> 01:58:04,616
<i>when Steve decided
to issue a letter saying,</i>

1766
01:58:04,744 --> 01:58:06,610
<i>"Well, you know,
nothing's wrong with me."</i>

1767
01:58:06,746 --> 01:58:09,238
"It's just a minor problem,"
And it wasn't a minor problem.

1768
01:58:10,667 --> 01:58:14,160
<i>Steve Jobs made a point
of withholding from the world</i>

1769
01:58:14,337 --> 01:58:16,795
<i>that he faced this illness.</i>

1770
01:58:16,923 --> 01:58:18,710
<i>That's something
investors want to know,</i>

1771
01:58:18,842 --> 01:58:20,549
<i>because when you
bought Apple stock then,</i>

1772
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:22,631
you were buying into Steve Jobs.

1773
01:58:22,804 --> 01:58:26,218
He was obligated
to tell shareholders right away

1774
01:58:26,349 --> 01:58:27,840
about this serious illness.

1775
01:58:29,019 --> 01:58:31,727
<i>You do personally
want to give Steve the privacy,</i>

1776
01:58:31,855 --> 01:58:34,814
<i>but Steve put the spotlight on him,</i>

1777
01:58:34,941 --> 01:58:38,730
and you can't turn that off
just because it's inconvenient.

1778
01:58:41,615 --> 01:58:44,358
<i>After the story came out,
I saw Steve.</i>

1779
01:58:44,492 --> 01:58:47,075
He started talking about Apple,
and he said,

1780
01:58:47,203 --> 01:58:51,447
<i>"You know, Apple is really a company
that doesn't have any divisions."</i>

1781
01:58:51,583 --> 01:58:53,700
<i>"We don't have all this bureaucracy."</i>

1782
01:58:53,835 --> 01:58:56,748
And I said, "Steve, that would be
a great story for <i>Fortune."</i>

1783
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:02,501
And he looked at me, and he said,
"No."

1784
01:59:02,636 --> 01:59:08,382
"I don't think we can do that story
with you. Not now."

1785
01:59:09,976 --> 01:59:11,592
"Not now."

1786
01:59:11,811 --> 01:59:15,725
And then he said,
and the whole room went quiet,

1787
01:59:15,857 --> 01:59:19,817
and he said, "you know, we used to..."

1788
01:59:21,154 --> 01:59:24,693
"We used to really be friends
with <i>Fortune,</i>

1789
01:59:24,824 --> 01:59:31,788
I used to be friends with <i>Fortune,</i>
but not anymore. Not anymore."

1790
01:59:31,915 --> 01:59:35,454
And then I remember these tears
came out of his eyes,

1791
01:59:35,585 --> 01:59:37,042
and one was on his glasses,

1792
01:59:37,170 --> 01:59:41,665
and then one, I remember it rolling
off his cheek and hitting his shirt,

1793
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:46,841
and he was just crying,
and the whole room was silent.

1794
01:59:48,890 --> 01:59:52,600
Apple CEO Steve Jobs today
made his first public appearance

1795
01:59:52,727 --> 01:59:54,593
since getting a new liver
five months ago.

1796
01:59:54,729 --> 01:59:55,845
<i>For the first time,</i>

1797
01:59:55,980 --> 01:59:58,893
<i>the 54-year-old CEO
publicly acknowledged</i>

1798
01:59:59,025 --> 02:00:02,484
<i>the liver transplant this spring
that saved his life.</i>

1799
02:00:02,612 --> 02:00:08,233
Well, I now have the liver
of a mid-20s person.

1800
02:00:11,871 --> 02:00:16,491
I'd like to take a moment and thank
everybody in the Apple community

1801
02:00:16,626 --> 02:00:20,836
for the heartfelt support I got, too.
It really meant a lot.

1802
02:00:20,964 --> 02:00:25,834
And I'd also like
to especially thank Tim Cook

1803
02:00:25,969 --> 02:00:29,679
and the entire executive team of Apple.

1804
02:00:29,806 --> 02:00:32,219
They really rose to the occasion

1805
02:00:32,350 --> 02:00:36,469
and ran the company very ably
in that difficult period.

1806
02:00:36,604 --> 02:00:38,937
So, thank you, guys.
Let's give them a round of applause.

1807
02:00:40,483 --> 02:00:42,065
<i>He loved what he did.</i>

1808
02:00:42,193 --> 02:00:44,230
I do have an e-mail from him
saying that.

1809
02:00:44,362 --> 02:00:46,854
<i>He said, you know,
"Both of us were fortunate," he said,</i>

1810
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:49,357
<i>in that we loved what we did</i>

1811
02:00:49,534 --> 02:00:52,277
<i>and we were able to do it
for a long time.</i>

1812
02:00:52,412 --> 02:00:54,825
<i>And he said,
"What else could you ask for?"</i>

1813
02:00:56,207 --> 02:01:00,918
We're maybe a little more experienced,
certainly more beat-up,

1814
02:01:01,045 --> 02:01:04,755
but the core values are the same.

1815
02:01:04,883 --> 02:01:09,503
I don't see why you have to change
if you get big.

1816
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:11,887
<i>Straightforward to me.</i>

1817
02:01:12,015 --> 02:01:14,348
<i>Apple was big.</i>

1818
02:01:14,517 --> 02:01:18,807
<i>By this time, one of the biggest
corporations in the world.</i>

1819
02:01:21,274 --> 02:01:24,858
<i>But each time we saw Jobs,
he seemed smaller.</i>

1820
02:01:28,364 --> 02:01:32,278
<i>As his devices got stronger,
Jobs got weaker.</i>

1821
02:01:32,410 --> 02:01:35,903
It's so much more intimate
than a laptop,

1822
02:01:36,039 --> 02:01:39,282
and it's so much more capable
than a smartphone

1823
02:01:39,417 --> 02:01:41,249
with this gorgeous, large display.

1824
02:01:41,377 --> 02:01:45,166
<i>I think that a lot of the grief
at Jobs's death</i>

1825
02:01:45,298 --> 02:01:50,464
was a fear that we had been
very comfortable

1826
02:01:50,637 --> 02:01:52,970
<i>for the last decade in his hands.</i>

1827
02:01:53,097 --> 02:01:57,762
It's phenomenal to hold the internet
in your hand.

1828
02:01:57,894 --> 02:02:00,181
<i>That he was going to keep
doing these amazing things.</i>

1829
02:02:00,313 --> 02:02:04,273
Now he's gone, and there's no indication
that anyone's going to replace him.

1830
02:02:36,975 --> 02:02:38,716
Welcome.

1831
02:02:44,691 --> 02:02:46,057
Thank you.

1832
02:02:58,454 --> 02:03:00,161
Thank you very much.

1833
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:05,542
- It always helps...
- We love you!

1834
02:03:05,712 --> 02:03:09,296
Thank you.

1835
02:03:09,507 --> 02:03:12,796
It always helps,
and I appreciate it very much.

1836
02:03:12,927 --> 02:03:16,841
<i>He resigned officially
in August. Two weeks earlier,</i>

1837
02:03:16,973 --> 02:03:20,466
<i>Apple had become the highest-valued
corporation on Earth.</i>

1838
02:03:20,643 --> 02:03:22,259
And thank you for coming so much.

1839
02:03:22,395 --> 02:03:24,978
<i>We've got a great week
planned for you.</i>

1840
02:03:49,923 --> 02:03:52,916
<i>This is a field
where one does not write a principia</i>

1841
02:03:53,051 --> 02:03:55,634
<i>which holds up for 200 years</i>

1842
02:03:55,762 --> 02:03:58,095
<i>or paints a painting that'll be
looked at for centuries,</i>

1843
02:03:58,222 --> 02:04:01,932
<i>or builds a church
that will be admired</i>

1844
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:03,972
<i>and looked at in astonishment
for centuries.</i>

1845
02:04:04,103 --> 02:04:06,436
No, this is a field
where one does one's work,

1846
02:04:06,564 --> 02:04:08,476
and in ten years, it's obsolete

1847
02:04:08,608 --> 02:04:11,225
and really will not be useable
within ten or 20 years.

1848
02:04:11,361 --> 02:04:13,273
I mean, you can't go back
and use an Apple I,

1849
02:04:13,404 --> 02:04:14,565
cos there's no software for it.

1850
02:04:14,739 --> 02:04:17,197
In another ten years or so,
you won't be able to use an Apple II.

1851
02:04:17,325 --> 02:04:19,783
You won't even be able to fire it up
and see what it was like.

1852
02:04:21,537 --> 02:04:24,996
<i>It's sort of like
sediment of rocks.</i>

1853
02:04:25,124 --> 02:04:26,831
<i>You're building up a mountain,</i>

1854
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:30,124
<i>and you get to contribute
your little layer of sedimentary rock</i>

1855
02:04:30,254 --> 02:04:32,246
<i>to make the mountain that much higher.</i>

1856
02:04:32,382 --> 02:04:35,966
<i>But no one on the surface will,
unless they have x-ray vision,</i>

1857
02:04:36,135 --> 02:04:37,842
<i>will see your sediment.</i>

1858
02:04:41,265 --> 02:04:44,679
<i>In Japan, there's
an idea called "mono no aware,"</i>

1859
02:04:44,811 --> 02:04:48,145
<i>meaning "the deep awareness of things".</i>

1860
02:04:48,272 --> 02:04:51,231
<i>It celebrates the melancholy
of the passing of life</i>

1861
02:04:51,359 --> 02:04:55,148
<i>and sees more beauty in the fallen leaf
than the one on the branch.</i>

1862
02:04:56,406 --> 02:04:59,319
<i>Maybe that's what Japan held for Jobs.</i>

1863
02:04:59,450 --> 02:05:04,320
<i>The sadness of the soul
as expressed in the beauty of things.</i>

1864
02:05:09,252 --> 02:05:11,869
<i>In the end, I was left
with the same question</i>

1865
02:05:12,005 --> 02:05:13,541
<i>with which I began this journey.</i>

1866
02:05:13,673 --> 02:05:18,213
<i>"Why did so many strangers weep
for Steve Jobs?"</i>

1867
02:05:18,344 --> 02:05:21,633
<i>It's too simple to say it was
because he gave us products we love</i>

1868
02:05:21,806 --> 02:05:25,675
<i>without asking why we love them
the way we do.</i>

1869
02:05:25,852 --> 02:05:28,060
<i>It's too simple even to conclude
that we love them</i>

1870
02:05:28,229 --> 02:05:30,346
<i>because they connect us
to a wider world</i>

1871
02:05:30,481 --> 02:05:33,599
<i>and the people in our lives
that are far away,</i>

1872
02:05:33,776 --> 02:05:37,110
<i>because these machines isolate us, too.</i>

1873
02:05:39,699 --> 02:05:43,568
<i>Perhaps the contradictory nature
of our experience with these gadgets</i>

1874
02:05:43,703 --> 02:05:46,286
<i>mirrors the contradictions
in Jobs himself.</i>

1875
02:05:48,666 --> 02:05:52,706
<i>He was an artist who sought perfection,
but could never find peace.</i>

1876
02:05:54,964 --> 02:05:58,833
<i>He had the focus of a monk,
but none of the empathy.</i>

1877
02:06:01,095 --> 02:06:04,805
<i>He offered us freedom,
but only within a closed garden,</i>

1878
02:06:04,932 --> 02:06:07,049
<i>to which he held the key.</i>

1879
02:06:11,314 --> 02:06:13,306
<i>To reconcile these contradictions,</i>

1880
02:06:13,441 --> 02:06:17,185
<i>I think we have to look to the other
half of our relationship with Jobs.</i>

1881
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:18,982
<i>To ourselves.</i>

1882
02:06:22,241 --> 02:06:26,451
<i>As Jobs wanted it,
the screen of my iPhone is dark.</i>

1883
02:06:26,621 --> 02:06:29,204
<i>A Zen landscape of the unseen.</i>

1884
02:06:29,332 --> 02:06:34,293
<i>If I stare into it, I see
an obscure reflection of myself,</i>

1885
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:37,037
<i>but this impression
lasts just a fleeting moment</i>

1886
02:06:37,173 --> 02:06:40,757
<i>before I press the home key
and the screen lights up.</i>

1887
02:06:40,927 --> 02:06:44,762
<i>But perhaps I should spend a moment
regarding that reflection,</i>

1888
02:06:44,931 --> 02:06:50,928
<i>asking myself what, in buying
and using this product, I am doing?</i>

1889
02:06:51,062 --> 02:06:53,554
<i>What is the full nature
of my transaction</i>

1890
02:06:53,731 --> 02:06:58,146
<i>with the maker of this magical
and intimate machine?</i>

1891
02:07:18,798 --> 02:07:24,965
<i>♪ Once I wanted to be the greatest</i>

1892
02:07:25,096 --> 02:07:27,383
<i>♪ Greatest, greatest, greatest</i>

1893
02:07:27,515 --> 02:07:33,352
