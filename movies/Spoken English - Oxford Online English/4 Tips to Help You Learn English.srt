00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:08,450
Hi, I'm Oli. Welcome to Oxford Online English.
In this video I'm going to tell you a little about

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:14,070
my language learning experiences and I'm going
to share with you some things I wish I'd known

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,960
before I started studying languages.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,320
I really hope you'll find these ideas interesting
and useful and you can use them to help you

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,350
learn English or even maybe another language!

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,310
First, let me tell you a little about myself
and why I do what I do, and why I’m making

7
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,869
this video.

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:36,670
I was always fascinated by foreign languages.
I remember the first time I went to a foreign

9
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:41,620
country. I was nine, and I went to Holland.

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,078
The thing that I liked best was hearing all
of these foreign sounds. I’d never really

11
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,100
heard people speaking other languages before.

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,329
Even then, I thought that speaking another
language would be a really cool thing to be

13
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,410
able to do.

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,559
Being able to open your mouth and produce
all of these foreign words and actually be

15
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:09,679
understood… That seemed almost like magic
to me as a child!

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,210
My Mum bought me a ‘How to learn Dutch’
book. It didn’t work! I didn’t learn any

17
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,210
Dutch.

18
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,829
But, I did study French and German at school
for many years. They were always my favourite

19
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:22,229
subjects.

20
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,869
When I was around 20, I set myself a goal.
I would travel the world, and by the time

21
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:30,159
I was 30, I would speak four foreign languages
fluently.

22
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,920
I don’t know why. There wasn’t much logic
to it. It doesn’t seem like the most coherent

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:44,229
life plan, even now. But, that’s what I’d
decided to do, so that’s what I did.

24
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:50,640
I lived in Russia, and studied Russian to
quite a high level. Then, I moved to China.

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,950
I studied Chinese, including written Chinese.

26
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:02,100
By the time I was 30, had I reached my goal?
Kind of. I could speak Russian, French and

27
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,780
Chinese well, and I could still speak some
German, though not so well.

28
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,610
Close enough—I don’t have any regrets.

29
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:16,510
Anyway, I made so many mistakes along the
way. I got so many things wrong. I wasted

30
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,569
lots of time and energy on things that didn’t
work.

31
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:24,230
There are so many lessons I had to learn the
hard way.

32
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:32,299
So, what were they?

33
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:40,349
I remember my first few Russian lessons. They
were bad. I couldn’t do anything. I didn’t

34
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:41,879
learn anything.

35
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:49,489
Why? Because I had just graduated from university,
and in my head, I was still at school.

36
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:54,599
When the teacher asked me a question and I
got it right, I thought: “Great! I achieved

37
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:00,299
something!” I thought this even if I just
guessed the answer.

38
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,120
If I got a question wrong, I thought, “I
feel bad!” I felt embarrassed.

39
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:14,790
If we did an exercise or a test, I thought,
“If I get a high score, I’ve succeeded!”

40
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,129
Worst of all, I thought that just turning
up to class was enough. After all, I wasn’t

41
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:25,299
responsible for my learning. The teacher was
responsible. That’s the teacher’s job.

42
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,930
I hope, I really hope, that you realise that
I’m saying these things because they’re

43
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,840
totally wrong, not because they’re how you
should think.

44
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,239
Getting a question right or wrong in class
means nothing by itself.

45
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,900
Getting a high score in a test means nothing
by itself.

46
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:49,049
Going to five classes, ten classes, or 500
classes means nothing by itself.

47
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:54,940
There’s only one thing that matters: what
have you learned?

48
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,390
What can you do that you couldn’t do before?

49
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:05,129
Teachers can make a big difference, sure.
One of the best teachers I’ve had (Hi Lola!),

50
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:08,030
helped me to change how I think.

51
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:14,980
Instead of feeling embarrassed about making
a mistake, I realised that mistakes are a

52
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,279
chance to understand something new.

53
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:24,179
Instead of worrying about getting things wrong,
I started to experiment and play with language.

54
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:30,000
Instead of seeing tests and exercises as targets
for someone else, I saw them as opportunities

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,550
to express myself and explore my own strengths
and weaknesses.

56
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:39,240
I put this at number one because it’s the
most important thing to learn.

57
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,740
It’s the biggest mistake I see English learners
making. I see adults, many of whom are older

58
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:51,090
than me, very professionally successful, acting
like they’re still at school, just because

59
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,650
they’re in a lesson with a teacher.

60
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,969
I’ve seen people copying their homework
from the answer key. I see people—full-grown,

61
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:07,410
successful adults—really caring about whether
they get a question right or wrong in class.

62
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:14,720
None of this matters by itself. All of this—questions
in class, exercises in your textbook, tests

63
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,800
and exams, English courses, certificates—they’re
just steps; they’re tools.

64
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,860
What’s your goal? To get a piece of paper
that says you speak English, or to actually

65
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,300
speak English?

66
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:36,770
If you start at lesson one and finish lesson
100, is that enough? Have you finished?

67
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:43,789
Do you want to get a high score in an English
exam, or do you want to speak such good English

68
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:47,000
that you never need to take an English exam?

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,060
So, get these old ideas from school out of
your head. Classes, exercises, tests and certificates…

70
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,340
All of these things can help you; these things
can give you structure and motivation, and

71
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,888
that can be important, but they aren’t the
end goal.

72
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:10,139
These things aren’t important in themselves;
they’re important for what they can help

73
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,860
you achieve.

74
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,520
Focus on what you can actually do.

75
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:21,539
Because that’s all that matters.

76
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:26,120
When I first moved to Russia, I was planning
to stay for six months.

77
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:32,069
After six months, I thought my Russian was
okay. But it certainly wasn’t good enough.

78
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:35,020
I decided to stay longer.

79
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:41,479
I thought that with six months more study,
my Russian would be where I wanted it to be.

80
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:47,190
After six months, I thought, “My Russian’s
alright, but if I just studied for another

81
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,750
six months, it would be good.”

82
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,190
I studied for another six months.

83
00:06:54,190 --> 00:07:01,219
I thought, “Yeah, my Russian’s not bad.
You know what I need? Six months’ more study.

84
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,090
It’ll be really good with another six months.”

85
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:11,549
There were a few more like this, but you can
see where this is going, I think.

86
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,270
Even when I left Russia, and I could speak
to a high level, I didn’t feel completely

87
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,270
satisfied.

88
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,780
It’s not just me.

89
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,940
You never feel like you’ve finished. You
always feel like there’s more to do, and

90
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,699
more to learn.

91
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:32,320
I promise you, this will be the same for you
with English. You’ll never feel like, “I’m

92
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,190
done now.”

93
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,610
Often, students ask me things like, “How
long will it take to get fluent?” “How

94
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,930
long will it take to learn English?”

95
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:49,440
No one wants to hear, “Forever!” It’s
not a popular answer! But, it’s true.

96
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,909
Why is this?

97
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:54,659
I think there are two reasons.

98
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,909
The first is that there is always more to
learn. I’m still learning things about English,

99
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:06,389
by teaching, writing and editing other people’s
work. I haven’t finished learning English,

100
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:12,639
just like you haven’t finished learning
English, because you never do.

101
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,510
What about the second reason?

102
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:20,719
Partly, it’s just human nature. We focus
on what we can’t do, just like we focus

103
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,169
on what we don’t have.

104
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:29,219
What you don’t have is much more interesting
than what you already have, right?

105
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:35,230
In the same way, what you can’t do seems
more important than what you can do.

106
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:41,250
When you learn something new, it’s satisfying
for a very short time. Then you forget about

107
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:47,170
it. You focus on what you don’t know; you
focus on what you can’t do.

108
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,939
This is natural. We all do it. All the time
I was studying Russian, I was getting better.

109
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,190
I was learning lots of new things.

110
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,360
But, it didn’t feel that way.

111
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:05,080
I’m sure many of you who’ve been learning
English for a long time can relate to this!

112
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,290
You study and study. You learn new things,
but you always feel like there’s something

113
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,250
you can’t do.

114
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,390
This is how it is. That feeling never totally
goes away.

115
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,370
So, what can you do about it?

116
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,520
Accept it. It’s not going to change!

117
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:30,939
Also, remember that how you feel isn’t always
the best guide to how things really are.

118
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,890
Just because you feel you aren’t getting
better, it doesn’t mean you’re not getting

119
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,270
better. It doesn’t mean you aren’t learning
anything new.

120
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,189
It’s just how you feel, and how you will
feel.

121
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:50,960
It’s not a reason to stop or get discouraged.
Keep studying; keep working and you will improve,

122
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:59,830
even if it doesn’t always feel that way.

123
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,590
I don’t know exactly when I first got the
idea of moving to China.

124
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:11,110
But, I know when I made up my mind: I read
a book called “River Town.” It’s about

125
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:16,700
an American guy who spent two years living
in Sichuan, in southern China.

126
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,400
He went there to teach English and study Chinese.
He lived in a small town where there were

127
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,480
two non-Chinese people, including him.

128
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,640
I loved the book, and at that moment, I knew:
I was going to China.

129
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,910
But, I wasn’t as brave as him. I couldn’t
imagine living in a small town with no other

130
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,880
English speakers. It sounded lonely.

131
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:45,540
I moved to Shanghai, where there are about
half a million foreigners.

132
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:53,010
I could meet people from many different countries,
and mostly my social life was English-speaking.

133
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:58,939
I wasn’t lazy, though. I studied hard. I
really wanted to get better. After three years,

134
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,140
my Chinese was quite good.

135
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:07,300
But, it wasn’t perfect. There was a lot
I couldn’t do. There was a lot I didn’t

136
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,300
know.

137
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,109
Why am I telling you this?

138
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:16,770
It’s because my Chinese was a reflection
of my life: I chose to move to a big, international

139
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:22,390
city, and I chose to hang out in mixed groups
where the common language was English.

140
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,760
So of course my Chinese wasn’t as good as
it could have been.

141
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,550
I had a couple of friends who did things differently.

142
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:36,261
One guy in particular did almost everything
in Chinese. He had Chinese roommates, most

143
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:42,010
of his friends were Chinese, and he worked
for a Chinese company.

144
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:47,270
His Chinese was perfect. Not just good, perfect.

145
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:52,540
It wasn’t because he studied harder than
me (although maybe he did). It was because

146
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,870
he lived his life in Chinese and I didn’t.

147
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:03,170
I see this a lot with English learners, particularly
in English-speaking countries.

148
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:08,260
Many of the students I meet live in the UK,
but don’t speak much English. They have

149
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:14,210
a community of people who speak their language,
and they don’t go outside that much.

150
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:18,870
I also see this a lot with people saying,
“I want to learn English, but I don’t

151
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,680
have chances to speak!”

152
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,689
To be clear, I know that big life changes,
like moving to another country, aren’t realistic

153
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,130
for everyone. I get that.

154
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,490
But here’s the thing.

155
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,710
You can’t separate language learning from
the rest of your life.

156
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:41,690
If you go to class twice a week, and don’t
use English or think about English the rest

157
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,180
of the time, your progress will always be
limited.

158
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:52,609
Do you want to speak perfect English? Do you
want to master the English language? Yes?

159
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,630
Then you need to live your whole life in English.

160
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:03,360
That might not be practical, but even so,
improving your English (or any language) means

161
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,200
changing your life.

162
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:12,290
It might mean moving to another country, working
in another company, changing your social circle,

163
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,300
or other large changes.

164
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,959
And yes, that can be very difficult! It can
involve making big sacrifices. I understand

165
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,990
that, but that’s how it is.

166
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:36,480
Language is a part of your life. The way you
live influences what you can learn.

167
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,960
How dare you, Oli! I am special!

168
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:46,010
I’m not saying you’re not special. I’m
not special. No one’s special when it comes

169
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,569
to learning a language.

170
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:53,730
Learning English, or any language, is very
democratic. Everyone’s in the same position.

171
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:58,940
It doesn’t matter how smart you are, how
rich you are, how professionally successful

172
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,580
you are… None of that really matters.

173
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,090
Let me tell you the last part of my story.

174
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:11,860
Now, I live in Greece. I’ve been here for
around three years.

175
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:17,160
If people ask me if I speak Greek, my answer
is “Not really.”

176
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:24,800
I can communicate in a basic way, and I understand
a lot, but I don’t claim to speak it.

177
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,910
After three years in Russia, I could speak
good Russian. After three years in China,

178
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,969
I could speak good Chinese.

179
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:36,950
So, what went wrong? I should speak good Greek
by now, right?

180
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,720
Remember: I’m not special; none of us are
special. I don’t speak good Greek because

181
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,020
I haven’t done enough work.

182
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:49,480
Partly, that’s because I’m busier. If
I’m honest, I’ve also been a little lazy

183
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
sometimes.

184
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,310
Okay, at this point, I want to say thanks
for listening to me. This is a more personal

185
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,599
video, and I appreciate that you’re still
watching.

186
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,440
So, let me finish by giving you the secret
to learning a language.

187
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,960
That’s right: I’ll give you the secret
to learning English, or any language!

188
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,050
Don’t get too excited—it’s really boring.

189
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:18,000
YouTube and the Internet are full of people
saying they have “the secret to learning

190
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,010
fluent English,” or “a way to learn English
in ten days.”

191
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:27,100
Normally, the secret is “buy my book – 99
dollars!”

192
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,000
I don’t have a book, because I’m too busy
to write one, so I’ll just tell you the

193
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,120
secret. You can have it for free.

194
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,070
It’s consistency.

195
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:42,220
I’ve taught thousands of students at this
point in my career, and the picture is very

196
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,770
clear.

197
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:49,319
People who study and work consistently, over
time, get the best results.

198
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,860
It’s not necessarily the smartest students
who do best.

199
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,180
It’s not necessarily the natural language
learners who do best.

200
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:04,579
It’s not necessarily the most enthusiastic
learners who do best, because enthusiasm tends

201
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,300
to burn out.

202
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,819
It’s the people who just keep going, who
don’t give up, who work and work and don’t

203
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,130
stop, who keep going even when it’s hard
and boring and they’re not enjoying it:

204
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:20,890
they do best. They get what they want.

205
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:24,939
Boring, I know, but it’s true.

206
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:34,860
So, thanks again for watching and listening
to me!

207
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,500
See you next time!
