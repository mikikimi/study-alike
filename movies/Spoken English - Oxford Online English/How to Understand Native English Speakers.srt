00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,480
Hi, I’m Gina.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,370
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:12,990
In this lesson, you can learn how to understand
native speakers in English.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,910
Many English learners find it difficult to
understand native speakers, even after years

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,750
of study.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,690
This can be frustrating and demotivating!

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:29,779
However, there are some simple things you
can do to improve your English listening and

8
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:35,019
make it easier to understand native English
speakers.

9
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:42,890
In this lesson, you’ll see five simple tips
you can use to understand native English speakers

10
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,100
more easily.

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,890
Look at this sentence:

12
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,490
I am from France.

13
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,220
Imagine you’re talking to someone.

14
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,150
How would you say it?

15
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,860
Would you say this sentence with the contraction?

16
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,690
I’m from France.

17
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,470
Or would you say the full form?

18
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,220
I am from France.

19
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,929
Now, think about these sentences:

20
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,430
He has already told me.

21
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,350
I would like to see that film.

22
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,169
They will not be here until tomorrow.

23
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,710
All of these sentences can be contracted.

24
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,500
Can you see how?

25
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,590
He’s already told me.

26
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,020
I’d like to see that film.

27
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,899
They won’t be here until tomorrow.

28
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:44,440
Would you pronounce the contractions, or not?

29
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,360
Think about it, and be honest—it’s not
a test!

30
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,820
Here’s the problem:

31
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,440
Many English learners don’t use enough contractions
when they speak.

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:03,550
They use the full form, for example he has
instead of he’s.

33
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:09,299
If you don’t use contractions when you speak,
it will be difficult to understand them when

34
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:11,459
you’re listening.

35
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,840
Why is this a problem?

36
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,099
Native speakers almost always use contractions
when they’re speaking.

37
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:24,519
If you find it difficult to understand contractions,
you’ll always have problems when you’re

38
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,930
trying to understand native speakers.

39
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,130
So what’s the solution?

40
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,959
Very simple: use contractions more in your
speech.

41
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:43,529
To do this, choose a simple topic—for example,
your family—and record yourself speaking

42
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:46,010
for one minute.

43
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:52,569
Listen to the recording and try to find any
places where you could have used contractions,

44
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:53,950
but didn’t.

45
00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:00,349
Then, repeat the exercise, and try to use
more contractions.

46
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:05,540
Then, try again with a different topic.

47
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:11,280
If you use contractions yourself, it’ll
become easier to understand them.

48
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:21,120
Here’s a simple question in English which
is often difficult for English learners to

49
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:23,409
understand:

50
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:29,679
What are you doing
Why do so many people find it difficult to

51
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,349
hear this question correctly?

52
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:35,268
Let’s look.

53
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:41,760
First of all, the letter ‘t’ in the word
what is usually not pronounced.

54
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,760
It changes to a /d/ sound, or it’s reduced
to a glottal ‘stop’ ‘t’.

55
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,569
Secondly, the word are is not pronounced /ɑː/.

56
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:57,578
It doesn’t rhyme with ‘car’ or ‘far’.

57
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:02,230
It changes to a very short sound: /ə/.

58
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,719
Next, the word you is not pronounced /jʊː/.

59
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,849
It doesn’t rhyme with ‘too’ or ‘do’.

60
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:15,599
It also becomes a very short sound: /jə/.

61
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,469
Finally, the words are not pronounced with
spaces in between.

62
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,050
The whole question is pronounced like one
long word.

63
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,150
So, the question which is written:

64
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,039
What are you doing?

65
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,289
Sounds like:

66
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,360
Whaddayadoing?

67
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:42,000
Of course, if you think are should be pronounced
/ɑː/, and you should be pronounced /jʊː/,

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,160
and so on, you’ll expect to hear:

69
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,919
What are you doing?

70
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,640
And of course, you probably won’t understand
the natural pronunciation:

71
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,780
Whaddayadoing?

72
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,419
What can you do about this?

73
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:02,698
Here are two suggestions:

74
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,210
One: learn about weak forms.

75
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,989
Weak forms are words which have a different
pronunciation in a sentence.

76
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:18,120
Learning about weak forms can show you that
there is some logic to English pronunciation,

77
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,659
even though you might not think so!

78
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:25,539
Two: pay attention to how people speak.

79
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,830
Don’t think about what you read in your
English textbook.

80
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:35,060
Listen to how people pronounce words and sentences
in real life.

81
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:42,289
You’ll realize that there’s a big difference
between textbook English and natural English.

82
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:48,710
Another good exercise here is dictation: choose
something to listen to, like a podcast or

83
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,688
a YouTube video, which is not too difficult.

84
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:57,449
Listen to one minute, and try to write down
everything you hear.

85
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:59,580
Pause as often as you need to.

86
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,700
This way, you can train yourself to follow
native English speech.

87
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,240
Look at a question with a word missing.

88
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,449
What’s the missing word?

89
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:19,770
________ you ready?

90
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:24,530
If you’re an average English student, you
said that the missing word is are.

91
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:30,049
That’s the correct answer, but it’s also
not the best answer.

92
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,340
What?

93
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,320
How can the correct answer not be the best
answer?

94
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,389
What are we talking about?

95
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:45,270
Actually, the best answer is that there are
no words missing.

96
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,490
You can just say,

97
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,120
You ready?

98
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,870
In spoken English, you don’t need to say
are.

99
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:59,930
In fact, you can make the question even shorter
and just say,

100
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,320
Ready?

101
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,139
Native speakers very often leave out words
like this.

102
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:14,129
Again, if you’re expecting to hear a full
question, these shorter questions can be confusing.

103
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:17,749
So when can you leave words out like this?

104
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:23,780
In yes/no questions which have the word you,
it’s often possible to make the question

105
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,219
shorter.

106
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,050
For example:

107
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,819
Have you finished?

108
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,410
Are you going?

109
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,910
Do you want to come?

110
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,120
All of these questions can be shortened:

111
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,409
You finished? or Finished?

112
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:50,900
You going? or Going?

113
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,370
You want to come? or Want to come?

114
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,439
So, what should you do?

115
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,689
Try to use these shortened questions when
you speak.

116
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:08,430
Like all of this advice, you need to use it
yourself.

117
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:14,730
If you use it when you speak, it’ll be easier
for you to understand others who speak in

118
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,749
this way.

119
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:25,340
Remember that native speakers very often shorten
questions like this.

120
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,619
Here’s a question:

121
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:33,950
Do you need to understand every word to understand
what someone is saying?

122
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,470
What do you think?

123
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:42,440
Very often, English learners focus on the
parts they don’t understand.

124
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,010
That’s natural, but it’s not always helpful.

125
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:54,830
To answer our question: no, you do not need
to hear and understand every word to understand

126
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,950
someone’s message.

127
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:02,810
Imagine that you are in the kitchen with your
friend, who is cooking something.

128
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,790
Your friend asks you a question, and you hear:

129
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,459
Can you (mumble mumble)?

130
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:15,190
Okay, so you didn’t hear or understand the
full question.

131
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,750
But that’s often not a problem.

132
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,640
First of all, you heard the words can you.

133
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,569
So you know that your friend wants you to
do something.

134
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,430
Secondly, you’re in the kitchen, cooking.

135
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,370
Whatever your friend wants, it’s almost
certainly connected to that.

136
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:42,090
Probably, your friend needs you to help with
something, or give them something.

137
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:48,120
By using the context, you can often understand
someone without hearing every word.

138
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:54,160
But, but, but, you say, that’s not really
understanding native speakers!

139
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:01,199
I want to understand native speakers, not
guess what they mean.

140
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,160
Actually, native speakers do this too.

141
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,189
You probably do it in your own language, so
there’s no reason not to do it in English.

142
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:16,510
Don’t think: “I don’t know the word,
so I can’t understand the sentence.”

143
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,710
It’s not true.

144
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:24,580
And, if none of this works, use another simple
trick: ask!

145
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:30,530
Ask the person, “What did you say?” or,
“Can you say that again?”

146
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,230
Again, native speakers do this all the time.

147
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,750
There’s no reason you shouldn’t do it,
too.

148
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:45,710
Often, English learners are afraid to ask
someone to repeat something, or to admit they

149
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,330
don’t understand.

150
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:54,830
But, if you do this, you have no chance to
understand, and no chance to communicate.

151
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:02,640
Remember: no one understands everything everyone
says, and it’s completely natural to ask

152
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,230
someone to say something again.

153
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:13,760
Let’s look at one more important tip.

154
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,480
Here’s a question: what does ‘native English’
sound like?

155
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:28,860
Here’s another question: do you prefer the
sound of British English, or American English?

156
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:34,490
Actually, those are both terrible questions,
which make no sense.

157
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,570
Do you know why?

158
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:45,940
The reason these are bad questions is: there’s
no such thing as ‘British English’.

159
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,580
If you think about ‘British English’,
you probably imagine someone speaking like

160
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,700
this.

161
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,860
But most British people don’t sound anything
like that.

162
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:04,860
It’s the same for American English: people
from different places and different backgrounds

163
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,500
will speak in different ways.

164
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:15,920
Then, of course, there are many other countries
where English is officially the first language:

165
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:28,189
Ireland, Zambia, Australia, Kenya, Canada,
Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Belize, South

166
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:33,140
Africa, Singapore, and many more.

167
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:40,040
The world of English is much bigger than just
the UK and the US, and you’ll be a better

168
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,500
English speaker (and listener) if you realise
this.

169
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:51,310
Unfortunately, many English learners react
negatively when they hear a native speaker

170
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,150
speaking in a way that they’re not used
to.

171
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,600
They say things like,

172
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,960
“I don’t like that person’s pronunciation.”

173
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,860
“That person doesn’t speak good English.

174
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,110
I prefer British English.”

175
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,390
(or: “I prefer American English.”)

176
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,640
“That person’s English sounds wrong.

177
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,400
I can’t understand.”

178
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:24,449
But, here’s the thing: in a real-life situation,
like a job interview, a meeting, or a party,

179
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:29,370
you’ll meet native speakers from different
places, with different accents.

180
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:36,590
It’s your responsibility to understand them
and communicate with them; they aren’t going

181
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:40,240
to change how they talk for you.

182
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,800
So, what can you do about this?

183
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,870
Don’t just listen to one kind of English.

184
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:54,270
If you love the sound of ‘classical’ British
English, then fine, but listen to other voices,

185
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,280
too.

186
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:02,780
You can train yourself to understand almost
anything, but you need time and practice.

187
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:09,319
Listen to a range of voices and accents regularly,
and you’ll be able to understand more of

188
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:15,080
what native speakers say to you.

189
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:23,100
Before we finish, we have a question for you:
in which situations do you find it most difficult

190
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,040
to understand native English speakers?

191
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,400
