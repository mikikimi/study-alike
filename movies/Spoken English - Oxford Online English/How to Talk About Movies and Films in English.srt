00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,790
Hi, I’m Daniel.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,020
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:11,149
In this lesson, you can see how to talk about
films in English.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,740
What was the last film you saw?

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,059
What kind of film was it?

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,609
Did you like it or not?

7
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:23,550
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to describe
films and give your opinion about different

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,579
films that you’ve watched.

9
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:30,419

with qualified, professional teachers.

13
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:51,129
But now, let’s start with a question: what
kind of films do you like?

14
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,890
Have you seen ‘No Country for Old Men’?

15
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,890
No.

16
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,670
I’ve never even heard of it.

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,930
What kind of film is it?

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:05,030
I guess you’d call it a thriller, but it’s
also kind of a modern western, because a lot

19
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,630
of it takes place in the desert, or small-town
America.

20
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,100
Is it scary?

21
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,048
I can’t do scary.

22
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:14,249
You might not like it, then.

23
00:01:14,249 --> 00:01:19,210
I can’t watch anything violent, horror films,
anything like that.

24
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,908
So what kind of thing are you into?

25
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:27,530
I like dramas, historical films, things like
that.

26
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,159
I like stories that focus more on real people.

27
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,590
I also have a weakness for cheesy rom-coms
occasionally.

28
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,250
What about you?

29
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,100
Yeah, I guess we have somewhat opposite tastes!

30
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,960
I’m a big fan of horror films, thrillers,
and so on.

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,559
In the dialogue, you heard a lot of words for different kinds of films.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,960
Do you remember any of the words we mentioned?

33
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:02,179
We'll give you a few seconds. Try to remember three.

34
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:07,600
You heard: ‘thrillers,’ ‘horror films’,
‘westerns’, ‘dramas’, ‘historical

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,299
films’ and ‘rom-coms’.

36
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:19,220
A western is a film set in 19th century America,
often featuring cowboys.

37
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,320
‘Rom-com’ is a short form of ‘romantic
comedy’.

38
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,180
Can you think of any other kinds of film which
we haven’t mentioned?

39
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,560
Try to think of three more!

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,140
Any ideas?

41
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,940
Maybe you said ‘action’, ‘comedy’,
‘cartoon’, ‘fantasy’, ‘musical’

42
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,900
or ‘sci-fi’.

43
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,080
‘Sci-fi’ is a short form of ‘science
fiction’.

44
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,500
Sci-fi films are set in the future, often
in space, and usually feature very advanced

45
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,040
technology, like time travel.

46
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,239
The Star Wars films are probably some of the
most famous sci-fi films.

47
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,600
Fantasy films often feature magic, dragons,
monsters, and things like that.

48
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,400
The Lord of the Rings films are good examples
of fantasy films.

49
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,240
Does your language have different words for
‘fantasy’ and ‘sci-fi’?

50
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:21,140
Some languages don’t; if this is true in
your language, be careful with the difference!

51
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:27,549
If someone’s talking about a film, and you
want to know what kind of film it is, you

52
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,840
can ask: ‘What kind of film is it?’

53
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,060
You could also say: ‘What sort of film is
it?’

54
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:44,250
To answer, you can just say: ‘It’s an
action film’; ‘It’s a thriller’; ‘It’s

55
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,730
a comedy’, and so on.

56
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:55,179
With some words, you need to say ‘film’
afterwards, like: ‘action film’, ‘horror

57
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,380
film’, ‘historical film’ or ‘sci-fi
film’.

58
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:06,120
With other words, you don’t say ‘film’
afterwards, like: ‘drama’, ‘thriller’,

59
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,240
‘musical’ or ‘western’.

60
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:15,480
So, don’t say: ‘It’s a thriller film’;
just say, ‘It’s a thriller.’

61
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,680
If you want to ask someone about their taste
in films, you can ask: ‘What kind of films

62
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,540
do you like?’

63
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,680
Or: ‘What kind of films are you into?’

64
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,320
Asking ‘are you into’ is a more conversational
way to ask ‘do you like’.

65
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,930
So, what kind of films are you into?

66
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,960
Can you answer this question with two to three
sentences?

67
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,840
Pause the video and try it now!

68
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,960
Next, let’s look at how you can introduce
one film which you’ve seen, and tell someone

69
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,690
else about it.

70
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,880
I saw a great film last night!

71
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,330
I can’t believe I didn’t see it when it
was on in the cinema.

72
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,460
Oh really?

73
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,580
What was it?

74
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,099
Blue Jasmine.

75
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,630
Do you know it?

76
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,980
Hmm…

77
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,770
Sounds familiar.

78
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,370
Is that the Steven Spielberg film?

79
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,420
No, it was directed by Woody Allen.

80
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,780
No, I don’t know it.

81
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,289
What kind of film is it?

82
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:26,190
I guess I’d call it a drama, but it’s
a bit of a black comedy, too.

83
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,990
Who’s in it?

84
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,350
Cate Blanchett plays the main character.

85
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:36,260
I’m guessing that if it’s a Woody Allen
film, it’s probably set in New York?

86
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,200
No, although the main character is a New Yorker.

87
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,469
Is it based on a book or anything?

88
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,480
I might be mistaken, but I think I read a
book with a title like that.

89
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,410
No, I don’t think so.

90
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:59,760
If you want to know more about a film which
someone saw, what questions could you ask?

91
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,760
You might ask things like: ‘Who was the
director?’

92
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,240
‘Who’s in it?’

93
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,400
‘Where’s it set?’

94
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,200
Or: ‘Is it based on a book?’

95
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,960
Do you know what the question ‘Who’s in
it?’ means?

96
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,969
This is asking about the actors.

97
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:27,400
It’s a short way to ask ‘Which actors
are in the film?’

98
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,419
Think about a film which you know.

99
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:36,150
It could be something you saw recently, or
maybe a film which you particularly like.

100
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,030
How would you answer these questions?

101
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,210
You could say: ‘It was directed by Stanley
Kubrick.’

102
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:50,510
In conversational English, you can also use
the name as an adjective, like this: ‘It’s

103
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,229
a Stanley Kubrick film.’

104
00:06:53,229 --> 00:07:00,740
To talk about actors, you might say ‘It
stars Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell.’

105
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:07,010
This sounds quite formal, so if you want to
sound more informal, you can say ‘Samuel

106
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,460
L. Jackson and Kurt Russell are in it.’

107
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,890
To say where and when the story takes place,
you could say ‘It’s set in Paris in the

108
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,880
1920s.’

109
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:28,420
Or: ‘It’s set in the near future, in an
imaginary country which is ruled by corporations.’

110
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:35,040
Finally, if a film is an adaptation of something
else, like a book or maybe a video game, you

111
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,050
can use the verb ‘based on’.

112
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,660
For example: ‘It’s based on the book by
Stephen King.’

113
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,810
OK, now it’s your turn to talk!

114
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,940
Think about a film you know.

115
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:53,889
Use the language from this section to make
two to three sentences to introduce the film

116
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:56,970
and give some basic information about it.

117
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,050
Pause the video and do it now.

118
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,300
How was that?

119
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:09,400
Remember that you can always review a section
if you need more time to practise.

120
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,919
Let’s look at our next point.

121
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,440
What are you watching?

122
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:18,199
Kung Fu Hustle.

123
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,430
Do you know it?

124
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,430
No…

125
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,240
Haven’t you watched this before?

126
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,860
Yes, many times!

127
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,190
It’s one of my favourites.

128
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,820
It looks weird, almost like a cartoon.

129
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,500
Yeah, you could say that.

130
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,819
It’s really original, but mostly it’s
just good fun.

131
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,580
You’re not meant to take it too seriously.

132
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,580
Is it violent?

133
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,800
I can’t watch violent films.

134
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,569
Kind of, but the violence is also quite cartoonish.

135
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,200
It has quite a touching storyline, too.

136
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,990
It’s silly, but sweet at the same time.

137
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,640
Was it popular when it came out?

138
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,290
Yeah, I think so.

139
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:02,449
It got really good reviews, and I think it
won some awards, too.

140
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,040
Want to sit and watch it together?

141
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,060
Sure!

142
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:12,439
If you enjoyed a film, you could use positive
adjectives to describe it, like ‘original’,

143
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,180
‘good fun’, ‘touching’ or ‘sweet’.

144
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,620
‘Sweet’ describes a film which makes you
feel happy and warm.

145
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,470
Often, romantic films are sweet.

146
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,760
‘Touching’ describes something which makes
you feel strong emotions.

147
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,250
You can also say ‘moving’, which has a
similar meaning.

148
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,940
If a film is ‘touching’ or ‘moving’,
you’ll probably be thinking about it for

149
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,600
some time after it finishes.

150
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,440
Can you think of any other positive adjectives
you could use to describe a film which you

151
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,120
liked?

152
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,370
Try to think of three, and write them down.

153
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,940
Pause the video if you want more time.

154
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,080
Ready?

155
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,800
What did you get?

156
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:05,290
Of course, there are many possibilities, but
here are some suggestions.

157
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:11,800
If a film really makes you think, or if it
makes you see things in a new way, you could

158
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,890
describe it as ‘thought-provoking.’

159
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:23,780
A film which has a realistic story and good
acting could be described as ‘believable.’

160
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:32,100
If a film is believable, you feel like you
could be watching real people in a real situation.

161
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,480
A good comedy film could be ‘hilarious’.

162
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,959
‘Hilarious’ describes something which
is extremely funny.

163
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,209
What else could you say about a film which
you liked?

164
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:51,380
You might give some details or reasons as
to why you liked it.

165
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,980
For example: ‘The story was really interesting
and original.’

166
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:03,140
‘The acting was amazing—really believable.’

167
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:09,790
‘It had great special effects and incredible
action scenes.’

168
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:16,589
You could also mention what kind of reviews
the film got, and whether it won any awards.

169
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:21,120
For example, ‘It got really good reviews.’

170
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,180
‘It was nominated for eight Oscars.’

171
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,520
‘It won several awards at the Cannes festival.’

172
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,760
OK, now it’s your turn.

173
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,550
Your job is to talk about a film you like.

174
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:41,630
Try to make three to four sentences describing
the film and why you like it.

175
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:47,430
If the film won any awards or prizes, you
could mention that, too!

176
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:52,859
Pause the video and make your answer now.

177
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,660
Here’s a tip: it’s always better to practise
as much as possible.

178
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:05,540
So, if you really want to improve your English,
don’t just practise once, make several answers.

179
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:13,560
Say each answer out loud several times, to
practise your pronunciation and fluency.

180
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,520
Ready?

181
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:20,579
Let’s look at one more point.

182
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:21,720
How was the film?

183
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
Urggh...

184
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Awful!

185
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,000
I wanted to walk out.

186
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,180
Why?

187
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,620
What was so bad about it?

188
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,220
Everything!

189
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,800
It was so slow and boring.

190
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,500
Plus, it was so predictable that I could even
guess what they were going to say next.

191
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,420
That’s surprising.

192
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,819
It got quite good reviews.

193
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,060
They must have seen a different film than
I did.

194
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:51,670
Also, it was dubbed, and they only used two
voice actors: one for the males, and one for

195
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,670
the females.

196
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,540
I never understand why they dub films like
that.

197
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,040
Why not just use subtitles?

198
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,620
Yeah, I agree, but I guess people don’t
like reading.

199
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,860
Was it scary?

200
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,980
Not at all!

201
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:13,550
It was quite gory, but it was all done so
badly that it wasn’t believable at all.

202
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:18,529
The special effects looked like they were
made on a laptop in twenty minutes.

203
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:20,399
That’s a shame.

204
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,490
So, why did you stay to the end?

205
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,680
My friends didn’t want to leave.

206
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:32,449
In the dialogue, you heard several adjectives
to describe a film you don’t like.

207
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,160
Can you remember any of them?

208
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,270
You heard: ‘awful’, ‘slow’, ‘boring’
and ‘predictable’.

209
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:48,829
‘Slow’ means that the story doesn’t
develop quickly, or that scenes in the film

210
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:52,160
go on for too long.

211
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,790
What other adjectives could you use to describe
a film which you don’t like?

212
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:06,300
You can also take positive adjectives and
make them negative; for example: ‘unoriginal’

213
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,670
or ‘unbelievable’.

214
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,589
Can you think of a film which you didn’t
like?

215
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,250
Why didn’t you like it?

216
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:21,810
As before, you should try to give reasons
to explain why you didn’t like something.

217
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:30,439
You could say something like: ‘The lead
actor was really bad; he was completely emotionless.’

218
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,040
‘The plot was stupid.

219
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,959
Nothing made any sense.’

220
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,459
‘It was completely unfunny.

221
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,380
No one in the whole cinema laughed once.’

222
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,930
Now, it’s your chance to practise!

223
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,180
Think of a film which you saw which you didn’t
like.

224
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:58,099
Make two to three sentences to describe the
film and say why you didn’t like it.

225
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:03,880
Pause the video and say your sentences aloud
now.

226
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:13,600
Finally, let’s see how you can put all of
this language together into a longer answer.

227
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,650
Your job is to make a longer answer using
language from this lesson to talk about a

228
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,840
film which you’ve seen.

229
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:27,720
You need to say what kind of film it is, give
some basic information about it, say if you

230
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,170
like or dislike it, and explain why.

231
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,000
Before you do that, let’s do some examples
together!

232
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,380
Here’s one:

233
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:42,720
‘I’m going to tell you about the film
Gravity, which is one of my favourite films

234
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,750
from the last few years.

235
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:50,950
It’s kind of a sci-fi film, but it’s set
in the present day and it doesn’t feature

236
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:57,389
aliens or anything like that, so you could
say that it’s more of a thriller.

237
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:03,890
It was directed by Alfonso Cuarón, and it
stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as

238
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,880
two American astronauts.

239
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,130
Most of the story takes place in space, in
orbit around the Earth.

240
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:19,029
I really like it because the visuals and the
special effects are incredible; it’s really

241
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:26,060
atmospheric, and it gives you a good sense
of the loneliness and terror of being stranded

242
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,768
in space.

243
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:33,080
I would say it’s one of the best space films
I’ve ever seen.’

244
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,340
Could you make an answer like this?

245
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:41,000
Before you try, let’s do one more example
together:

246
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,350
‘I never saw Titanic until quite recently.

247
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:51,779
Everyone raves about it like it’s the best
film ever made, but honestly I wasn’t impressed.

248
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:59,660
The cast was good; Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate
Winslet are great actors, but I found it boring.

249
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,529
The biggest problem is that it’s predictable.

250
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:09,589
You know the story beforehand, so there can’t
be any surprises.

251
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:17,579
I also thought it was too long and slow; it’s
over three hours, but there’s not enough

252
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,679
plot to fill so much time.’

253
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,060
OK, now it’s your turn.

254
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:29,610
Use the language from this video, and look
up any other words you need.

255
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:37,459
Then, make your longer answer and say it aloud,
or write it down, or both!

256
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:43,380
Don’t forget that if you really want to
practise effectively, you should make many

257
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:51,380
different answers, and also practise saying
each answer aloud multiple times.

258
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,530
If you want, you can leave one of your answers
in the comments.

259
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:58,379
We’ll give you some feedback and corrections!

260
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,130
Thanks for watching!

261
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:00,880
See you next time!
