00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,939
Hi, I’m Martin.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,210
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:16,430
In this lesson, you can learn how to describe
a person who you know in English.

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,320
Think about someone you know well.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,480
It could be someone in your family, a close
friend, someone you work with, or someone

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,109
else.

7
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,840
How would you describe this person?

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,429
What does this person look like?

9
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:37,430
What kind of personality does this person
have?

10
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:44,550
Describing a person is useful in many situations,
including speaking exams like the IELTS speaking

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,239
test or the FCE speaking exam.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:56,580
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to describe
a person in detail using clear, natural English.

13
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,760
During this lesson, you’re going to practice,
so you need to think of someone you’re going

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,169
to describe.

15
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,540
It can be anyone you know well.

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,960
Got someone?

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,960
Great!

18
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,809
Let’s begin.

19
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,670
Part one: describing appearance.

20
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,579
First question: what does he or she look like?

21
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:24,499
What can you say when describing a person’s
appearance?

22
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:27,979
You can talk about the person’s height and
build:

23
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:31,539
"My brother is tall and well-built."

24
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:35,680
"My friend Lia is medium height and slim."

25
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,259
"Craig, who I work with, is short and overweight."

26
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:45,149
Do you know what 'well-built' means?

27
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:51,130
Someone who is well-built is broad and strong,
with big muscles.

28
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:56,579
You can also add adverbs to make your sentences
more precise:

29
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,630
"My brother is quite tall and well-built."

30
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,369
"My friend Lia is medium height and really
slim."

31
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:09,720
"Craig, who I work with, is short and a little
overweight."

32
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:16,030
Then, maybe add something about the person’s
hair:

33
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,950
"He has short, brown hair, but he’s going
bald fast."

34
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,730
"She has long, dark blonde hair."

35
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,560
"He has curly, fair hair."

36
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,860
What does 'fair' mean here?

37
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:39,580
It’s the opposite of 'dark', and you can
use it to describe someone’s hair or skin.

38
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:45,560
Finally, what else can you say about the person’s
appearance?

39
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:52,320
Imagine you’re describing the person to
me, and you want me to be able to recognise

40
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,340
this person from your description.

41
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,980
What could you say?

42
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,869
There are many possibilities, of course, but
here are a few suggestions:

43
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,440
"He looks a bit like a younger version of
Vin Diesel."

44
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,130
"She’s really beautiful, with very striking
features."

45
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:21,260
"He has a long scar on his right elbow."

46
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,250
Do you know what 'striking features' means?

47
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,720
In this context, 'features' refers to someone’s
face.

48
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,290
'Striking' means that you can’t help noticing
something.

49
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:43,609
So if someone has 'striking features', it
means he or she has a very unusual and attractive

50
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,590
face.

51
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,590
What about 'scar'?

52
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,520
Scars are left over when you get a deep cut
or have an operation.

53
00:03:52,520 --> 00:04:01,030
Okay, so now you should be able to make three
sentences about the person you’re describing,

54
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,030
like this:

55
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,050
"My brother is quite tall and well-built.

56
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:10,140
He has short, brown hair, but he’s going
bald fast.

57
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,209
He looks a bit like a younger version of Vin
Diesel."

58
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:23,480
Your turn: pause the video and make three
sentences about the person you’re describing.

59
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:31,710
Remember: height/build, then hair, then general
appearance.

60
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,070
Could you do this?

61
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:40,710
If so, great job—we’ve only done one part,
and you’ve already got the start of a good

62
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,909
description.

63
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,880
But of course, there’s more we can add.

64
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,240
Part two: describing positive characteristics.

65
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,240
Another question: what’s this person like?

66
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,560
Do you know what this question means?

67
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,310
It means I want you to tell me about the person’s
personality.

68
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:13,680
Let’s start with positive words you can
use to talk about someone’s character.

69
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,669
Think about the person you’re describing.

70
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:23,669
What good things can you say about him or
her?

71
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:32,260
You could describe someone as 'kind', but
it’s better to be more specific if you can.

72
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:38,760
Better words to use are 'considerate'—meaning
someone who always thinks about other people

73
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:46,599
and their needs—or 'warm'—meaning someone
who shows positive feelings to others and

74
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,810
makes other people feel good.

75
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:55,240
Or, maybe this person is good at making other
people laugh.

76
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,180
You could say they are 'funny' or that they
have a 'good sense of humour'.

77
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:07,480
More generally, you can describe someone as
'fun' or 'entertaining' if people enjoy spending

78
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,980
time with them.

79
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,050
What else?

80
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:18,300
Well, for a friend, it’s very important
that a person is 'reliable'—that you can

81
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:24,960
depend on them to keep their promises and
be there for you when you need them.

82
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,719
Similarly, you could describe people as 'honest'
or 'straightforward'.

83
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:38,090
If someone is straightforward, they’re honest,
easy to understand and easy to spend time

84
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,419
with.

85
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:46,370
Straightforward people say what they think,
but not in a rude way, and they don’t keep

86
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,460
secrets or gossip about other people.

87
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,270
Let’s look at three more.

88
00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:00,370
Most of us like spending time with people
who are 'cheerful'—people who smile a lot

89
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,400
and are usually in a good mood.

90
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:10,200
Cheerful people are often 'positive' and 'optimistic'—they
expect good things to happen.

91
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:19,659
So now you have twelve positive adjectives
you can use to describe someone’s personality.

92
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:26,020
Can you use any of these adjectives to talk
about the person you’re describing?

93
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:32,400
When you use these adjectives, always try
to add an example or a reason.

94
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,120
For example, don’t just say:

95
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,400
"My brother is really funny."

96
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,388
"My friend Lia is a very cheerful person."

97
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:48,340
Add some details or examples to make your
answer more interesting, like this:

98
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,179
"My brother’s really funny.

99
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,620
He likes making weird jokes, generally at
the most inappropriate moment."

100
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,490
"My friend Lia is a very cheerful person.

101
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,800
Even early in the morning, she’s always
smiling and in a good mood.

102
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,710
I don’t know how she does it!"

103
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:19,390
If possible, you could even add a story to
really illustrate the person’s character.

104
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,740
"Craig, who I work with, is such an honest
guy.

105
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:29,590
I remember one time he found a wallet with
£500 in a pub.

106
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:34,400
It would have been easy to keep the money—there
was nothing in the wallet to say whose it

107
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:40,990
was, but he said it wouldn’t be right to
keep it, and he insisted on going straight

108
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,440
to the police, right that minute."

109
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,480
Adding stories like this can really bring
a description to life.

110
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,529
You’ve also seen some good ways to use these
adjectives:

111
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:59,189
"My brother is really _______."

112
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:08,310
"My friend Lia is a very ________ ."
"Craig is such an _______ guy."

113
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:15,930
Of course, you can change these and use them
in your answer.

114
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,949
What about you?

115
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:25,250
Pause the video, and try to use some of these
adjectives about the person you’re describing.

116
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:31,510
Don’t forget to add details and examples
to your description, or you can even add a

117
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,520
story if possible!

118
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:41,500
Next, let’s look at part three: describing
negative characteristics.

119
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,580
No one’s perfect, right?

120
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:51,620
We all have our flaws, so let’s look at
how to describe the bad side of someone’s

121
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,210
personality.

122
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:59,750
Many of the words you saw in part two have
direct opposites which you can use.

123
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,570
For example:

124
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:07,630
'kind' → 'unkind'
'considerate' → 'inconsiderate'

125
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:13,410
'honest' → 'dishonest'
'reliable' → 'unreliable'

126
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:20,699
Of course, there are other words you can use,
too.

127
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:29,610
Some people can be 'selfish' or 'self-centered'—they
think about themselves too much, and don’t

128
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,130
think about the needs of others.

129
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,000
These two words have a similar meaning.

130
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,920
Even more extreme, you can describe someone
as 'self-obsessed'.

131
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,819
A self-obsessed person only thinks about themselves,
and doesn’t seem to realise that other people

132
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,570
exist at all!

133
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:57,860
Not everyone can be funny, but you don’t
want to be seen as 'humourless' or 'dull'.

134
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:05,750
'Dull' is similar to 'boring', while 'humourless'
means that someone has no sense of humour

135
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,690
and is too serious.

136
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:14,700
If someone doesn’t do what they say or doesn’t
keep their promises, you’ve already seen

137
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:20,770
two words you can use: 'dishonest' or 'unreliable'.

138
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:30,100
Similarly, you could describe someone as 'insincere'—meaning
that someone says things without meaning them.

139
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:37,860
For example, if someone is always friendly
on the surface, but they don’t really feel

140
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,910
anything inside, you could describe that person
as insincere.

141
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,150
Their friendliness doesn’t mean anything.

142
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:54,630
Finally, cheerful people are always in a good
mood, but what’s the opposite?

143
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,340
You could describe someone as 'moody' or 'grumpy'.

144
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:05,020
Moody people’s moods change very easily,
and they are often in a bad mood.

145
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:14,019
Grumpy people never seem to be in a good mood
and are always unhappy and negative.

146
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:23,750
So now, you have twelve negative adjectives
to go with your twelve positive adjectives!

147
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:32,210
As before, when you use these adjectives to
describe someone, try to add details or examples.

148
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,750
For example:

149
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:40,980
"My brother can be a little unreliable sometimes.

150
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,290
He often ‘forgets’ to do things he promised
he would."

151
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:52,060
"Lia’s great, but sometimes I feel she’s
a bit insincere.

152
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,670
She says all these nice things, but I’m
not sure she really means them."

153
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,430
"My colleague Craig is so moody.

154
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:08,729
He’ll be fine one minute, then suddenly
he starts acting like he hates everyone.

155
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:13,459
It makes him quite difficult to be around."

156
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:20,359
You can see how we often use slightly more
indirect language to talk about someone’s

157
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,649
negative characteristics:

158
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:27,839
"My brother can be a little _______ sometimes."

159
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,690
"Sometimes I feel that she’s a bit ________."

160
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:38,720
Of course, if you really want to be direct,
you can be:

161
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,550
"My colleague is so ________."

162
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:50,120
Now, pause the video and try to use these
words and phrases.

163
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:59,100
Make 2-3 sentences, and don’t forget to
add examples and details!

164
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,210
Part four: talking about your relationship.

165
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:11,269
Finally, let’s add some details about how
you know this person and your relationship.

166
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:13,100
Look at three sentences:

167
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,870
"We’ve known each other ________."

168
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,240
"We met ________."

169
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,620
"We get on _______, because ________."

170
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,060
Do you know what 'get on' means here?

171
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:32,979
By itself, it means to have a good relationship
with someone.

172
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:38,320
You can add adverbs after 'get on' to give
it different meanings.

173
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,430
For example:

174
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,849
"We get on very well."

175
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,380
"We get on well sometimes."

176
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,020
Or you can make it negative:

177
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,449
"We don’t get on very well."

178
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,470
Okay, look at the sentences again:

179
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,470
"We’ve known each other ________."

180
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,470
"We met ________."

181
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,470
"We get on _______, because ________."

182
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:03,279
How could you complete them?

183
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,880
You could say:

184
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,019
"We’ve known each other for about ten years."

185
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:10,970
"We met at university."

186
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:17,350
"We get on really well, because we have a
similar sense of humour."

187
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,800
Of course, there are many possibilities:

188
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,620
"We’ve known each other almost our whole
lives."

189
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,450
"We met when we were babies, before we could
even walk!"

190
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:39,610
"We get on well most of the time, although
we argue sometimes, too."

191
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:45,720
Depending on who you’re talking about, it
might not make sense to use all of these sentences.

192
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,050
For example, if you’re talking about your
brother or another relative, it doesn’t

193
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:56,959
make sense to talk about how long you’ve
known each other or where you met.

194
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:03,589
However, you can still talk about how well
you get on and why.

195
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:10,089
You could also add how often you see each
other, or what you like to do together.

196
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:17,110
"I don’t see my brother often, though we
talk a couple of times a month.

197
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,970
When we meet up, we like watching films or
playing cards."

198
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:30,760
Either way, try to make three sentences about
the person you’re describing, like this:

199
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,829
"I’ve known my friend Lia for about five
years.

200
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:39,779
We met because we worked in the same place
for a few months.

201
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:45,790
We get on really well, because we have a lot
in common: we like the same films, the same

202
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,990
music, and so on."

203
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,250
"I’ve known Craig since July.

204
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,640
We actually met at a mutual friend’s birthday
party, and then we realised we work in the

205
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,439
same place.

206
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,812
We get on alright but we aren’t close.

207
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:07,990
We’re just different people and we don’t
seem to have much to talk about."

208
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,910
Now you try!

209
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:17,209
Pause the video and make three sentences about
your relationship with the person you’re

210
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:18,800
talking about.

211
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,300
Use the words and phrases from this section.

212
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,059
Alright?

213
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:30,139
Now, we have one more thing to do:

214
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:35,299
Part five: making a longer answer.

215
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:40,470
In this lesson, you’ve learned how to describe
a person by:

216
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:50,770
talking about their appearance; talking about
the positive and negative sides of their personality;

217
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:56,300
talking about your relationship and how you
know each other.

218
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:04,100
Now, let’s put everything we’ve done together
into a longer answer.

219
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,780
Here’s one:

220
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,470
"My brother is quite tall and well-built.

221
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:16,190
He has short, brown hair, but he’s going
bald fast.

222
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,720
He looks a bit like a younger version of Vin
Diesel.

223
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,780
He’s really funny.

224
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,530
He likes making weird jokes, generally at
the most inappropriate moment.

225
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:31,050
However, he can be a little unreliable sometimes.

226
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,460
He often ‘forgets’ to do things he promised
he would.

227
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,280
I don’t see him often, though we talk a
couple of times a month.

228
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,940
When we meet up, we like watching films or
playing cards."

229
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,600
This answer uses examples you’ve already
seen.

230
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,770
Let’s do one more longer answer with original
examples:

231
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:00,889
"I’m going to tell you about a friend of
mine, Sarah.

232
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:05,809
She’s quite short and very slim, with light
brown hair.

233
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:10,260
She’s very pretty and she has a really nice
smile.

234
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:15,799
Sarah’s cheerful and fun to be around, and
she’s also very straightforward: you know

235
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:20,500
who she is right away and it’s easy to feel
comfortable around her.

236
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,790
I’ve known her for about twelve years now,
since university.

237
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:32,918
We get on well because we have a similar attitude
to life and we always have lots to talk about."

238
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:36,890
Okay, now it’s your turn!

239
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:41,130
Make a longer answer to describe someone you
know.

240
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:46,640
Use the examples and language from this lesson
to help you.

241
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:53,240
If you want, you can post your answer in the
video comments and we’ll give you feedback.

242
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,650
That’s the end of the lesson.

243
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,870
I hope it was useful for you!
