00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:03,790
Hi, I’m Johan.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,720
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,660
In this lesson, you can learn something that
will help you to sound more like a native

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,950
speaker when you're talking.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,229
What is this thing?

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,080
It’s vague language.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,311
What does vague mean?

8
00:00:18,312 --> 00:00:21,880
Vague means that something is not clear or
detailed.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:29,560
For example, if you ask me what I did yesterday,
and I reply, “Just some stuff at home,”

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,169
that is a vague answer.

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,590
I’m not giving you any details.

12
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,549
Why does this matter?

13
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:39,699
Vague language is both common and important
in natural English.

14
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:44,660
It has many different uses, which you can
learn about in this video.

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,690
Using vague language will make your English
sound more natural and closer to native English.

16
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:56,220
First, let's look at the most important use
of vague language.

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,360
Part one: avoiding unnecessary detail.

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,960
In some situations, vagueness is bad.

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,790
For example, if you have a contract or a legal
document, it shouldn’t be vague!

20
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,300
In general, we prefer to avoid vagueness in
writing.

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,420
However, speaking is often the opposite.

22
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,490
Imagine that you ask your friend, “What
are you doing tomorrow?”

23
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,539
Look at two possible answers.

24
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,590
One: "First, I’m going into the city centre.

25
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:32,740
I need to buy a shirt and some toothpaste,
then at 10.30 I’m meeting William Bukowski

26
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,360
for coffee at the café on Gloucester Square."

27
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,120
"I’m going into town to buy some stuff,
then I’m meeting someone for a coffee."

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,700
Which answer sounds more natural?

29
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,270
The second one, right?

30
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,710
Can you explain why it sounds better?

31
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,679
In speaking, being too detailed can sound
very formal and unnatural.

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,979
It also wastes time: if I ask you a simple
question like, “What are you doing tomorrow,”

33
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:08,699
of course I don’t want to know every detail
of where you’re going, what time, who with,

34
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,449
and so on.

35
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:12,011
So what language can you use here?

36
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:17,260
The words 'thing' and 'stuff' are very useful.

37
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,250
The word 'thing' is very useful.

38
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,760
You can use 'thing' or 'things' to refer to
an object or objects.

39
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,019
For example:

40
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,600
"Give me that thing to clean the window."

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,019
"Don’t forget to take your things with you."

42
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,550
You can also use 'stuff' in a similar way.

43
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,830
Remember that 'stuff' is uncountable.

44
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,290
For example:

45
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,310
"We’re only going for two days, so we don’t
need much stuff."

46
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:52,900
Or: "Every time I move apartments, I throw
loads of stuff away."

47
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:58,959
Both words 'thing' and 'stuff' can also be
used to talk about things you have to do.

48
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,209
For example:

49
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:02,940
"I have to go to that thing tonight."

50
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,240
Or: "I have a lot of stuff to do next week."

51
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,170
We also often use vague language when talking
about numbers.

52
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:17,319
When talking about numbers or quantities,
you can avoid unnecessary detail by using

53
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:23,260
expressions like 'loads of', 'lots of', 'a
few', 'a couple', etc.

54
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,649
For example:

55
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,670
"They sent me 34 emails yesterday."

56
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,569
Or: "They sent me loads of emails yesterday."

57
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:38,310
"I saw six of my old school friends last night."

58
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,379
Or: "I saw a few of my old school friends
last night."

59
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:47,410
"I have to finish three more things, and then
we can go."

60
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,520
Or: "I have to finish a couple more things,
and then we can go."

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:58,190
In all of these cases, it’s more natural
to avoid giving the exact number unless the

62
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,720
number is somehow important.

63
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,730
Another way to use vague language is when
shortening a list.

64
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:09,329
Imagine that your friend just came back from
vacation, and you ask your friend, “What

65
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,019
did you do?”

66
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:12,130
Your friend says:

67
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:18,129
"We went swimming in the sea, sunbathed on
the beach, read books, ate in restaurants,

68
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:24,770
took a surfing lesson, visited different villages,
slept a lot, went for a bike ride and spent

69
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,020
one day relaxing."

70
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,440
This doesn’t sound good, right?

71
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,949
It sounds quite robotic, no?

72
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:40,139
In informal speech, we usually shorten long
lists by using a phrase on the end like: '…and

73
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:47,819
that kind of thing', '…and things like that',
'…and so on', '…or something like that'.

74
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:54,740
So, your friend might say:
"We went to the beach, did some sightseeing

75
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,270
and things like that."

76
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,169
Sounds more natural.

77
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:00,810
It’s also more polite in a way.

78
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:08,409
When you say something like this, you’re
giving some details but not every detail.

79
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:13,930
This shows that you are engaged in the conversation,
but it also shows that you understand that

80
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,539
the person you’re talking to probably doesn’t
want to hear every single detail.

81
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:24,150
Finally, it also allows the other person to
ask for more details if they’re actually

82
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,469
interested.

83
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,960
Instead of throwing information at someone,
you’re letting the other person choose where

84
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,188
to take the conversation.

85
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:35,919
Let’s look at some more examples of this:

86
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,650
"They serve curries, kebabs, grilled chicken
and that kind of thing."

87
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,888
"He told me about his new job, how his kids
are doing, and so on."

88
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:53,300
"We could go see a film, go for a walk or
something like that."

89
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,259
In all of these cases, we could continue the
list, but we don’t need to.

90
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:04,020
Using vague language to avoid unnecessary
details is a very common and important use,

91
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,270
but vague language also has other uses.

92
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,279
Let’s look:

93
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:15,110
Part two: using vague language to be indirect.

94
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,029
Imagine your friend comes to your home.

95
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:22,449
You notice your friend looks cold, so you
ask, “Shall I turn on the heater?”

96
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,580
Compare two answers:

97
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,580
"Yes, please.

98
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,090
It’s cold in here."

99
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,460
Or: "Yes, please.

100
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,039
It’s kind of cold in here."

101
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,159
What’s the difference?

102
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:40,688
The first answer sounds very direct, which
could be quite impolite.

103
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:43,880
It sounds a bit like a criticism.

104
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:51,320
By using the phrase 'kind of', the second
answer is vaguer and therefore more indirect.

105
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,110
This makes it softer and more polite.

106
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,970
You can use the phrases 'kind of' or 'sort
of' in this way.

107
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:58,970
For example:

108
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,940
"Can I have some milk?

109
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,689
The food’s kind of spicy."

110
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:08,039
Saying “The food is spicy” again sounds
very direct, and could sound rude.

111
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:11,248
"He sort of annoys me sometimes."

112
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:17,449
Of course this is a criticism of someone,
but using 'sort of' makes it softer.

113
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:22,759
"I kind of just want to stay in tonight."

114
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,229
Saying “I want to stay in tonight” sounds
very direct.

115
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:32,628
Adding 'kind of' and 'just' as well makes
it sound softer.

116
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:35,969
You might want to use this with times.

117
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:41,919
For example, you can use the words 'about'
or 'around' when arranging to meet someone,

118
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,119
especially if it’s just a casual meeting.

119
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,689
For example:

120
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:49,839
"Let’s meet at four."

121
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,919
More direct, could sound more like an order.

122
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,128
"Let’s meet at about four."

123
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:58,369
More indirect, sounds more like a suggestion.

124
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:02,270
"Can you get here at ten?"

125
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,270
More direct.

126
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,399
"Can you get here around ten?"

127
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,399
More indirect.

128
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:11,309
Of course, you don’t always want to use
vague language.

129
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:17,009
If your friend needs to be here by ten o’clock
at the latest, then you shouldn’t say "Can

130
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:18,709
you get here around ten?"

131
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:24,749
But in other cases, using vague language will
make you sound more indirect, friendlier and

132
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:27,689
generally more polite.

133
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:34,159
Part three:using vague language when you’ve
forgotten a word or a name.

134
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,890
Many English learners complain that they can’t
remember vocabulary.

135
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:42,150
Well, I have good news: you don’t always
need to!

136
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:47,420
No native speaker knows every word in English,
and native speakers also forget words all

137
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,500
the time.

138
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,110
So what can you do if you can’t remember
the word for something?

139
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,410
Vague language can be your friend!

140
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,089
Take a look:

141
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,530
"What does this thingy do?"

142
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:05,150
"You can use this little whatsit to take out
your SIM card."

143
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:10,240
Or: "I found a little metal thingamajig in
my desk drawer.

144
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,110
No idea where it came from."

145
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:22,320
Words like 'thingy' or 'whatsit' or 'thingamajig',
these are not normally used in written English.

146
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,570
You can use them whenever you’re speaking
if you don’t know what something is called.

147
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,100
You can also do this with people if you’ve
forgotten someone’s name.

148
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,440
For example:

149
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,890
"I’ve got a meeting with whatsisface from
the ad company tomorrow."

150
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:44,920
"He’s moving in with whatsername—you know,
that girl he met at his friend’s wedding."

151
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:53,110
'Whatsisface' is a word made from the question
“What is his face,” which makes no sense,

152
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,680
and it’s not really very clear where it
comes from.

153
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:03,270
'Whatsername' is easier to understand: it’s
made from the question “What is her name.”

154
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:09,290
You can change the words to talk about men
or women:

155
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,280
'Whatsisface'/'whatserface'
'Whatsisname'/'whatsername'

156
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,730
Again, these words cannot be used in written
English!

157
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,520
They are also very informal, so you really
shouldn’t use them unless you really know

158
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,680
the person you’re talking to well.

159
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,310
You should also never use these words directly
to someone’s face.

160
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,170
You can’t say:

161
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,680
"Hey, whatsisface!

162
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,479
Good to see you, but I’ve forgotten your
name."

163
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,470
That doesn't sound good at all!

164
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,650
Part four: using vague language to be rude.

165
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:48,270
Before, we saw how you can use vague language
to sound more indirect or polite.

166
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:54,400
But sometimes, you can also use vague language
to show that you don’t want to talk to someone.

167
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:00,170
For example, if you ask someone, “What did
you do at the weekend,” and the person answers

168
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:05,069
by saying, “Stuff,” this sounds rude.

169
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:10,250
This is like saying, “I don’t want to
tell you.”

170
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:16,970
Another example, if you ask your friend, “What
do you want to do tomorrow,” and your friend

171
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,050
says, “Whatever,” this also could sound
quite rude.

172
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:25,280
It’s like saying, “I don’t care what
we do.”

173
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:31,280
Generally, using vague language in a very
short answer—one or two words—can sound

174
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,280
rude.

175
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,949
It can sound like you don’t want to talk
to someone.

176
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:41,500
So, use vague language when you speak—but
remember that how you use it is important.

177
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,070
OK, that’s the end of the lesson.

178
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:53,570
I hope you learned some new stuff about…
whatchamacallit… vague language.
