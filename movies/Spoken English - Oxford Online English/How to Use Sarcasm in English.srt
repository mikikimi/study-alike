00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,399
Hello, I’m Mia.

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:06,009
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:12,000
In this lesson, you can learn about how to
be sarcastic in English.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,020
Imagine your friend has an exam.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:20,060
Your friend is really lazy, doesn’t study
at all, and fails the exam.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,990
Someone says to your friend:

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,169
It’s surprising that you failed, after all
the hard work you did.

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,140
This is an example of sarcasm.

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:36,060
In this lesson, we’ll look at how you can
be sarcastic in English, along with some key

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,030
words and phrases you can learn to practice
your new humour!

11
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,870
Let’s get started.

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,489
Part One: What is Sarcasm?

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,730
Sarcasm means saying the opposite of what
you mean in order to make fun of someone.

14
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:59,330
It’s very common in the UK and often leads
to confusion when you’re learning English!

15
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:05,990
British humour is famous for using a lot of
sarcasm with a very straight face, so many

16
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:11,970
people find it hard to tell when British people
are joking or being serious.

17
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,530
Now, you don’t need to be confused anymore,
let’s take a look at some examples of sarcasm

18
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,840
so that you can see what it looks like!

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,790
For example, imagine you see your co-worker
sitting at his desk with his feet up, reading

20
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,270
a magazine.

21
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,020
You could say:

22
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,408
You look busy!

23
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:34,409
Or:

24
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,460
I see you’re working hard!

25
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,539
Now, your co-worker is not really busy or
working hard.

26
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,680
By saying the opposite of what he’s doing,
you are using sarcasm to create humour in

27
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,140
the situation and make fun of your co-worker.

28
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,140
Ready to learn how to be sarcastic?

29
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,399
Part Two: When to be Sarcastic:

30
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:09,560
Okay, now that we’ve looked at what sarcasm
is, let’s take a look at when to be sarcastic.

31
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:16,900
As sarcasm is a type of humour that responds
to a situation, firstly it’s important to

32
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,590
know which situations work well with sarcasm.

33
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,669
The first situation is when something bad
happens to you.

34
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:29,819
Imagine that you’ve just made yourself a
slice of toast.

35
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:33,730
You put butter on it—and then you drop it
onto the carpet!

36
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,879
The butter is all over your new carpet.

37
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:41,890
In this situation you might say something
like:

38
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,219
Great.

39
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:44,540
Fantastic.

40
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,870
Brilliant.

41
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,230
Of course, this is not great, fantastic or
brilliant at all!

42
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,439
You are being sarcastic.

43
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:58,858
In the UK, this response is common when something
goes wrong.

44
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:05,579
Remember that we only use it with small things
that are annoying, not something really serious

45
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:07,959
or dangerous.

46
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:10,370
The next situation is very similar.

47
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,709
You can use sarcasm when somebody else does
something wrong.

48
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:18,230
Imagine that your friend is making a drink.

49
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,619
When he goes to sit down, he spills it all
over himself.

50
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,799
You could use this opportunity to be sarcastic
by saying something like:

51
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:29,000
Well done.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,840
Or:
Great job.

53
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,629
As you can see, you are saying the opposite
of what you think.

54
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:44,159
Another time we might use sarcasm is when
somebody says something that’s so obvious

55
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,439
that it sounds a little stupid.

56
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,510
Imagine that your friend says:

57
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,739
Did you know that Madrid is the capital of
Spain?

58
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:55,159
You might say:

59
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,339
No.

60
00:03:56,339 --> 00:03:57,519
Really?

61
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,469
I did not know that.

62
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:06,480
Of course, you did know that and by using
a sarcastic response, you can make the situation

63
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,048
funny.

64
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:14,230
You can also use sarcasm when something unsurprising
happens.

65
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,798
Imagine that your friend is writing an essay
for a history class.

66
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:24,770
He’s not very good at history, he doesn’t
study and he writes the essay very quickly,

67
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,020
an hour before the he has to hand it in.

68
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:33,150
Unsurprisingly, he gets an ‘F’ on his
essay.

69
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,568
When your friend tells you:

70
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:37,479
I got an ‘F’ on my history essay.

71
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:42,008
Of course, you’re not surprised at all.

72
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:43,910
You might say something like:

73
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,320
I’m shocked!

74
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
Or:

75
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,580
No one saw that coming!

76
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,650
Of course, there are many other situations
where you could be sarcastic, but these are

77
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,719
the main ones to remember.

78
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,630
It’s important to remember that sarcasm
should be used in light situations where you

79
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,819
want to make a joke.

80
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:11,830
Be careful not to use it if the situation
is more serious or if someone’s upset—you

81
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,109
don’t want to offend them!

82
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,080
Part Three: How to be Sarcastic:

83
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,639
Now that you have a good idea of when to use
sarcasm, let’s look at some key phrases

84
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,340
and expressions you might use when you’re
being sarcastic.

85
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:35,989
A lot of sarcastic responses tend to be short
phrases or interjections.

86
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:42,169
Like all humour, sarcasm depends partly on
responding quickly, so it works well with

87
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:45,270
short responses.

88
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,400
Imagine that your friend offers to help you
paint your new apartment.

89
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,530
You’re working hard.

90
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:57,789
You’ve almost finished two walls already,
and then you look over and see that your friend

91
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:01,659
hasn’t even painted half of one wall yet!

92
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,330
You might say:

93
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,389
Great job.

94
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:06,629
Thanks for the help.

95
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:08,860
Take your time.

96
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,710
These phrases make the situation humorous
through sarcasm.

97
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,989
Be careful you don’t sound too annoyed when
you say them!

98
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,680
These phrases are useful in other situations,
too.

99
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,639
For example, if your friend is helping you
cook dinner and he burns it, you could also

100
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,639
say:

101
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,639
Good job!

102
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,810
Or:
Thanks for the help.

103
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:39,039
As you can see, these phrases would work well
in a lot of different situations.

104
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:46,599
Later, the same friend tells you he has to
cook for twenty people at a dinner party this

105
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:48,240
weekend.

106
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,840
Having seen his lack of cooking skills, you
say:

107
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,359
Good luck with that.

108
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,979
That’ll be fun.

109
00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:02,389
If one of your friends tells a bad joke that
isn’t very funny, you could say:

110
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,710
That’s so funny.

111
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,818
Hilarious.

112
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:12,370
Can you see how saying the opposite of what
you mean makes something sarcastic?

113
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,272
When you remember that, it’s very easy to
be sarcastic in these situations!

114
00:07:16,272 --> 00:07:18,310
Now imagine that you and another friend are
both applying for the same job.

115
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:25,009
By learning and using short phrases like these,
you can be sarcastic in a range of situations

116
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:26,060
very easily.

117
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,810
Why don’t you give it a go?

118
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,410
Part Four: What happens if you’re Misunderstood?

119
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:39,069
Hopefully by now you’re feeling confident
enough to try being sarcastic!

120
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:46,349
It’s important to go out and practice your
new language skills so that you improve them.

121
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:51,849
Don’t worry about making mistakes—this
is natural and it happens.

122
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:57,680
Now, let’s see how you can make it clear
that you’re being sarcastic.

123
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,539
It’s important that people can understand
that your sarcasm is a joke and that you aren’t

124
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:07,080
just being mean.

125
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,370
Listen to this:

126
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,229
Thanks for the help.

127
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:12,889
Good luck with that.

128
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:14,370
I did not know that.

129
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,479
That’ll be fun.

130
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:18,979
Can you see the problem?

131
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:27,949
It’s not obvious if I’m being sarcastic
or not, which can make things very confusing!

132
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:33,700
Sometimes you can use intonation to show that
you’re being sarcastic.

133
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:40,630
Some people make sarcastic phrases flatter
or more emotionless like this:

134
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,630
Thanks for the help.

135
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,360
Good luck with that.

136
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:52,550
Other people might use a stronger intonation,
drawing out the words to emphasise them, like

137
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,670
this:

138
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,829
I did not know that.

139
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,770
That’ll be fun.

140
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,800
Can you tell the difference now?

141
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,199
Thanks for the help!

142
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,140
Thanks for the help.

143
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:10,050
The first was genuine and the second was sarcastic,
of course!

144
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:16,729
It’s important to remember that English
is a very wide language with a lot of accents

145
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:21,230
and personality, so sarcasm can sound different.

146
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:26,930
Most people will know you’re being sarcastic
from the context of the conversation.

147
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,790
Facial expressions also help to show people
that you’re not being serious, so it’s

148
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,469
important to use these too!

149
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,170
If you are misunderstood by someone, don’t
worry!

150
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,579
It’s easy to make it clear that you weren’t
being serious.

151
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,440
You could say something like:

152
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,279
I’m only joking.

153
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,560
Or:
Just kidding!

154
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,410
This makes it clear that what you said was
a joke.

155
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:56,410
You could also tell them that you’re being
sarcastic, by saying something like:

156
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,709
I was being sarcastic.

157
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,290
That was sarcasm.

158
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,219
I didn’t mean that, it was sarcastic.

159
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,170
That’s the end of our lesson.

160
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,550
You made it all the way to the end of a short
video!

161
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,550
Well done!

162
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,529
What an achievement!

163
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,630
I’m just kidding, of course!

164
