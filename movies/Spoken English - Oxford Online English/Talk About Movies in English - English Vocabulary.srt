1
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:02,469
Hi there!

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,509
I’m Johan from Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:05,839
Do you love cinema?

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,770
Or do you just want to find some topics to
talk about in English?

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,540
Either way this will be a fantastic lesson
for you, because we’re going to look at

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,650
how to have interesting conversations about
film and cinema in English.

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,869
We’ll look at how to talk about films in
general, and you can also learn vocabulary

8
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:26,689
to talk about different kinds of films in
English.

9
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:28,800
But first…

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,610
Part one: how to talk about your favourite
film.

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,590
The easiest way to start talking about films
is to ask:

12
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,480
"What is your favourite film?"

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,250
I can tell you about myself.

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,910
My favourite film is Apocalypse Now.

15
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:55,949
If you were talking to me, you could follow
this question by asking: "Why do you like

16
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,950
it?"

17
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:02,920
For me, I like this film because it has an
interesting plot.

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,840
It also has great cinematography and some
amazing performances.

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,290
Plot is another word for story.

20
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:17,760
Cinematography refers to the imagery of the
film—how it looks and how it was shot.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,680
Apocalypse Now has great cinematography because
it has many beautiful, shocking and memorable

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,960
scenes, which I’ll always remember.

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,839
Performance means how an actor acts.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,890
You can say things like:

25
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:38,170
"Edward Norton’s performance in Fight Club
was surely one of the best of his career."

26
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:46,110
"Steven Spielberg always gets good performances
out of his actors."

27
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,410
What else can I say about this film?

28
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:56,440
If you haven’t seen it, or you don’t know
what it is, I could give you some more basic

29
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,210
information, such as:

30
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,869
It’s a war film.

31
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:06,100
It’s set in Vietnam during the war.

32
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,970
It was directed by Francis Ford Coppola.

33
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:15,680
It’s based on a book by Joseph Conrad.

34
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,819
What about your favourite film?

35
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,760
You could use these sentences to talk about
it:

36
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,950
It’s a something film.

37
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,349
It’s set in...

38
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:29,540
It was directed by...

39
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,010
It’s based on...

40
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,899
What else can you say about your favourite
film?

41
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,800
Can you make one or two sentences to explain
why you like it?

42
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,530
Pause the video and practice if you want.

43
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:49,350
Next, do you know what the word for a style
of film is?

44
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,820
We use the word genre.

45
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:56,849
It’s pronounced with a /ʒ/ sound which
sounds like the ‘s’ in television.

46
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:00,040
You can also talk about types of films or
kinds of films.

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,549
The meaning is the same.

48
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,940
What genres of film do you like or dislike?

49
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,380
Next, you’re going to learn how to talk
about different types of films in more detail.

50
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,250
Shall we begin with some feel-good films?

51
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:18,510
Part two: feel-good films: comedies, musicals
and animations.

52
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,810
Who’s this?

53
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,860
This is Charlie Chaplain, one of the first
producers of comedy films.

54
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:30,709
His style is called slapstick and this means
that silly things happen to him, like slipping

55
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:32,780
on a banana.

56
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,310
Slapstick is usually simple, physical comedy.

57
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:43,330
Some other famous comedies are Ace Ventura:
Pet Detective, The Hangover or Monty Python

58
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,260
and the Holy Grail.

59
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,340
These are different types of comedy.

60
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,160
The Hangover is more of a gross-out comedy.

61
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,880
Its jokes are based on disgusting ideas or
images.

62
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,100
Monty Python is a famous surreal comedy.

63
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:02,159
It’s surreal because its humour is based
on strange situations and weird jokes.

64
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,849
If you laughed or enjoyed the film you would
say the film is funny or amusing.

65
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:11,030
If you laughed a lot you could say something
like:

66
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,830
"The Hangover was hilarious."

67
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,910
You could also describe how much you laughed.

68
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,680
For example, you could say:

69
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,050
"I’ve never laughed so much!"

70
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,440
"I was on the floor laughing."

71
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,340
Or,

72
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:36,909
"I laughed till I cried."

73
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,430
Another feel-good genre is musicals.

74
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,320
What do you think this means?

75
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,330
As you can imagine, these films have a lot
of singing.

76
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:56,530
Some famous examples are Singing in the Rain,
High School Musical and The Sound of Music.

77
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,469
If a musical had memorable songs you could
use the word catchy to describe them:

78
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,770
"The songs in The Sound of Music were very
catchy."

79
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:12,130
This means that the songs get into your head,
so you might find yourself singing the songs

80
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,719
to yourself days or weeks later.

81
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,140
Musicals should also have good dance scenes,
where all the cast dance together.

82
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:29,310
Dance scenes need good choreography—this
is how the dance scenes are planned.

83
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:35,919
"I love Moulin Rouge for many reasons, but
I particularly like the choreography."

84
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,849
Many films have soundtracks—songs which
are used within the film.

85
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,440
For a musical, the soundtrack is obviously
important.

86
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,729
Often, you can buy the soundtracks to famous
films.

87
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:56,260
"She’s been listening to the Frozen soundtrack
non-stop for weeks now."

88
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,599
Have you seen Frozen?

89
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,620
It’s a musical, but it’s also an animation.

90
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:10,690
These films are made by animators – people
who draw or use graphics to create the film.

91
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,930
Think of films like The Lion King, Shrek or
Ice Age.

92
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:21,120
These films are often made just for children,
but they often have stories that both adults

93
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,750
and children will enjoy.

94
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:30,550
Modern animations like Ice Age are made largely
using computer imagery, but traditional animations

95
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,889
were hand-drawn.

96
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:34,729
"I prefer older animated films.

97
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:40,880
I think the hand-drawn style creates a nicer
feel."

98
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,560
Many of these feel-good films are sentimental.

99
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,820
They make you feel emotional, or maybe they
even make you cry.

100
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,240
I never cry during films, though, honest!

101
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,740
If a film makes you feel strong emotions,
you can describe it as moving.

102
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,710
This brings us to our next topic.

103
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:05,440
Part three: moving films: romance, dramas
and epics.

104
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,330
When was the last time you saw a moving film.

105
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,440
Was it a romance or perhaps a drama?

106
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:21,360
Often, romance films follow a simple structure:
boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl.

107
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,930
What language can we use to describe these
types of films?

108
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:30,800
If it made you cry you can say that it brought
you to tears or that you cried all the way

109
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
through:

110
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,180
"Titanic was a moving film; it brought me
to tears."

111
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,610
Or, you could say:

112
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:45,550
"I cried all the way through Titanic; romantic
films always make me emotional."

113
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:51,849
We can also talk about the chemistry between
the two characters.

114
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:55,830
This means that you can feel the passion between
the two main actors.

115
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:03,008
"There was so much chemistry between Leonardo
Dicaprio and Kate Winslet."

116
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:06,440
Titanic is also an example of a drama.

117
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,550
A drama is a film where the characters are
realistic.

118
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,530
The story focuses on their relationships and
problems.

119
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:20,770
Some other famous examples of dramas are The
Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption.

120
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,330
Drama is a very broad genre.

121
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:29,008
Dramas can be positive and uplifting like
The Shawshank Redemption, which has a happy,

122
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:34,938
optimistic message, but some dramas can be
dark and bleak, like Twelve Years a Slave,

123
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:39,779
which deals with more unpleasant and negative
themes.

124
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,159
Maybe the film really made you think about
life.

125
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,529
Sometimes the film has an open ending.

126
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:51,059
In these cases you would say that the film
was thought-provoking or you could say that

127
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:52,719
it left you thinking.

128
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,120
"The Shawshank Redemption left me thinking."

129
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,160
Or:

130
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,929
"Citizen Kane was thought-provoking."

131
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:08,379
Some dramas are based on true stories or real
historical events.

132
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:13,579
For example, Lawrence of Arabia is a historical
drama about real people and events.

133
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:14,800
Have you seen it?

134
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,910
It’s nearly four hours long!

135
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,800
This makes it an epic.

136
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,309
Epics are films which have very big, broad
stories.

137
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:28,439
Epics often have different characters and
sub-plots.

138
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:30,839
Do you remember what plot means?

139
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,379
Then you should be able to guess the meaning
of a sub-plot.

140
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:39,230
A sub-plot is a mini-story, maybe involving
minor characters.

141
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,389
For example, the main plot of a film might
be about the hero’s battle against evil,

142
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:49,670
while there is also a sub-plot about his or
her love interest.

143
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,579
Epic films often have many sub-plots, which
can make them very long.

144
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:57,209
Most epics are over two hours long.

145
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:03,540
Some other famous epics are Ben Hur, Braveheart
or Gangs of New York.

146
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,469
Epics are usually big-budget films: they cost
a lot to make.

147
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,510
"The budget for Ben Hur must have been huge."

148
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:16,470
Some epics, like Braveheart, contain a lot
of exciting action scenes.

149
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,920
This brings us to…

150
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,860
Part four: exciting films: horror, sci-fi
and action.

151
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,019
Some films try to scare you: these are horror
films.

152
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,850
Who is this?

153
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:35,819
For most people it’s Frankenstein but technically
it is Frankenstein’s monster.

154
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:42,800
There are many other scary films such as Nightmare
on Elm Street, The Exorcist or Jaws.

155
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,389
Some people don’t watch horrors because
it gives them nightmares.

156
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:49,589
Do you watch them?

157
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:54,509
Good horror films should be terrifying or
even petrifying.

158
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:58,790
Petrifying means that something is so scary
that you can’t even move.

159
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,599
"The Ring was petrifying.

160
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,199
I was too scared even to go upstairs by myself
after I saw it."

161
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:09,959
You can also say that the film will give you
nightmares.

162
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:17,670
"Jaws is a terrifying film; it really gave
me nightmares."

163
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:24,819
Some horror films use a lot of violence and
blood to scare you, but others depend on atmosphere.

164
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:27,420
These horror films are spooky or creepy.

165
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,459
They scare you by creating a sense of the
unknown.

166
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:32,868
"The Blair Witch Project was so spooky.

167
00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:35,980
I couldn’t sleep for a week!"

168
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,480
What about this famous horror film?

169
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,329
This is an alien from the film Alien.

170
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:47,709
This film is a horror film, but it’s also
sci-fi.

171
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:50,800
Do you know what sci-fi stands for?

172
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,649
It stands for science fiction.

173
00:11:54,649 --> 00:12:01,879
Sci-fi films show us futuristic scenarios,
often with advanced technologies like teleporters

174
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:04,839
or faster-than-light travel.

175
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,459
Many sci-fi films are set on other planets,
or even in outer space.

176
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:12,268
For example, Alien was set on a spaceship.

177
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:16,639
This means that sci-fi films often use a lot
of special effects.

178
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:24,180
"The special effects in the original Star
Wars were very advanced for when it was made."

179
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:29,790
Special effects can be created using models
or computer graphics.

180
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:35,549
Special effects which are made using computers
are often called CGI—computer-generated

181
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:36,608
imagery.

182
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:43,769
"When a film uses too much CGI, it stops being
believable."

183
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:46,089
Have you seen The Matrix?

184
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:47,769
This film was famous for its CGI.

185
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:51,050
It used a lot of techniques that hadn’t
really been used before.

186
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:59,949
The Matrix is another film which fits into
two genres: it’s sci-fi, but it’s also

187
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:01,998
an action film.

188
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:07,779
Action films are typically full of fights,
guns, car chases and explosions.

189
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:10,430
This looks like a scene from an action film.

190
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:18,579
James Bond, Indiana Jones and the Matrix films
are examples of action films.

191
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:20,719
Quite often these films have stunts in them.

192
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,470
For example, the hero might have to jump out
of a moving car, or fight someone on the roof

193
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,550
of a moving train.

194
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:34,160
Which do you prefer: films with real stunts,
or CGI?

195
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,430
Probably real stunts, right?

196
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:42,638
However, action films aren’t the only exciting
film genre…

197
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,379
Part five: mystery films: thrillers and crime.

198
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:51,489
Some films really hold your attention all
the way through.

199
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:56,470
You don’t know what’s going to happen,
and this can make you feel excited or nervous.

200
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,230
These films are thrillers.

201
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,499
The Usual Suspects is an example of a thriller.

202
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:07,129
Director Alfred Hitchcock is famous for his
thrillers, including the classic film Psycho.

203
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:13,139
Thrillers are suspenseful—they make you
feel excited or nervous because you aren’t

204
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,970
sure what's going to happen next.

205
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,959
In a good thriller, the suspense will keep
you on the edge of your seat.

206
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:24,508
"The Silence of the Lambs kept me on the edge
of my seat all the way through."

207
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:27,730
A good thriller is also gripping.

208
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,589
You can’t stop watching because you want
to see what’s going to happen.

209
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:37,139
"The Usual Suspects is a gripping film with
a brilliant twist."

210
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:41,049
What’s a twist?

211
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:45,870
Many thrillers have a twist—a very surprising
change of direction.

212
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,470
A good twist is unpredictable.

213
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,949
For example, you could say:

214
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:57,689
"I really didn’t see the twist coming in
Memento."

215
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,689
For a bad thriller, you might say,

216
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:04,319
"I saw the twist coming a mile away.

217
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:06,738
Boring!"

218
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,509
Many thrillers and exciting films are also
crime films.

219
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:16,149
Crime films can be detective stories, where
detectives try to solve a mystery, or they

220
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,609
can be stories about criminals.

221
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:24,860
Like thrillers, crime films should be gripping
and suspenseful.

222
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,970
Many crime films are also quite violent.

223
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,790
If a film has a lot of violence, you can describe
it as brutal.

224
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,170
"Scarface has some pretty brutal scenes."

225
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:41,878
If a film is so violent that it’s difficult
to watch, you might describe it as gruesome.

226
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:44,489
"I couldn’t get to the end of Reservoir
Dogs.

227
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:46,730
It was just too gruesome."

228
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:52,189
The best crime films need a good villain.

229
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:55,279
The villain is the opposite of the hero.

230
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,939
The villain in a crime film is often the number
one criminal, the bad guy.

231
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:05,509
"No Country for Old Men surely has one of
the best villains of any film."

232
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:11,859
However, sometimes the bad guy is the hero
of the film.

233
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:16,470
In this case, you can describe the main character
as an antihero.

234
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,959
In a good crime film, you’ll sympathize
with the antihero, even though they’re a

235
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:21,959
criminal.

236
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,549
"Leon is a great film.

237
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:29,660
Even though he’s a professional killer,
you see his human side."

238
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,779
So now you should be able to talk about films
you like and discuss many different kinds

239
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:38,769
of film in English.

240
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:43,129
There’s a lot of vocabulary in this lesson.

241
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:45,730
Can you remember some of the new words you’ve
heard?

242
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,720
For example, what does bleak mean?

243
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,040
What kind of film can be described as hilarious?

244
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,809
What does a suspenseful film do to you?

245
00:16:55,809 --> 00:16:57,969
Don’t worry if you can’t remember everything!

246
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,139
You can always watch the video again to review
the vocabulary.

film vocabulary!

249
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,529
That’s all from me.

250
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,530
What’s your favourite film?

251
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,299
What film genres do you like/dislike, and
why?
