00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,540
Hello, I’m Mia.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,670
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,960
In this lesson, you can learn how to talk
about relationships in English.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,830
How can a wingman help you talk to people
you like?

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,610
If someone leads you on, should you be happy
or annoyed?

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:24,180
And what does it mean if someone tells you,
“I’m out of your league?”

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,490
In this lesson, you can learn what all of
these words and expressions mean and more.

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,198
Let’s get started.

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,140
Part 1: having a crush.

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,210
Imagine you’re single but you don’t want
to be.

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,810
You wish you were in a relationship, perhaps
you’ve got a crush on someone.

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,450
Having a crush means that you like someone
romantically.

13
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:55,910
So if there is someone you find attractive
or you like their personality, you could say

14
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,199
you have a crush on them.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,350
You might also use the word 'like'.

16
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:09,439
From the context, or your tone of voice, people
would understand that you mean ‘like romantically’

17
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,589
and not ‘like as a friend’.

18
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,749
Perhaps you want to speak to this person,
but you’re too shy to do it alone.

19
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:19,199
You need a wingman.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,479
A wingman is a person that helps you meet
attractive people and start talking to them.

21
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:31,289
Your wingman is usually a friend you can trust
to make you look good in front of someone

22
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:32,840
you like.

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,560
Your wingman can be a man or a woman!

24
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,890
For example, they will tell your crush interesting
things about you or encourage them to chat

25
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,890
to you.

26
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:48,679
They might talk to the other person’s friends
so that you can have time talking to the person

27
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:50,329
you like one-to-one.

28
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:54,279
Now, imagine you’re in a bar with your crush.

29
00:01:54,279 --> 00:02:00,039
You’re chatting to them and giving them
compliments, maybe making them laugh.

30
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:02,759
We would say you’re flirting with them.

31
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,750
This means that you’re talking in a playful
way, which shows that you’re interested

32
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,889
in them.

33
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:15,899
For example, if you offer to buy your crush
a drink or dance with them or tell them they

34
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,020
look nice, you could say you’re flirting
with them.

35
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,620
But what if they don’t seem to return your
feelings?

36
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,760
Maybe they think you’re leading them on.

37
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,630
If you lead someone on, you’re not really
interested in them, you’re only interested

38
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,990
in the attention you receive from them.

39
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:42,680
For example, if someone dances with you and
enjoys flirting with you, but they don’t

40
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,120
like you romantically; they’re leading you
on because they only enjoy the attention they’re

41
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
receiving.

42
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,970
They’re not really interested in you.

43
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,280
Or, maybe they’re already taken!

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,210
If you’re taken, it means that you’re
already in a relationship with somebody else.

45
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,750
However, perhaps they’re just playing hard
to get.

46
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,730
This means that they’re acting like they
don’t like you because they want to make

47
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,420
you more interested.

48
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,470
They don’t want your job to be easy!

49
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:20,500
Let’s review:
If you have a crush on someone, you like them

50
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
romantically.

51
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,780
Maybe you’d want a wingman to make you look
good in front of them.

52
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,380
When you make your intentions clear, you’re
flirting with your crush.

53
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:35,600
If they’re playing hard to get, they may
seem like they’re not interested even if

54
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,540
they like you.

55
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:43,470
If they’re leading you on, they’re only
interested in attention from you and if they’re

56
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,420
taken, they’re already in a relationship
and it’s best to find a new crush!

57
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,489
Part 2: dating.

58
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:58,040
Okay, let’s imagine that your wingman was
great and you got the courage to talk to your

59
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
crush.

60
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,150
Things were going well so you decided to ask
them out.

61
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:10,640
If you ask someone out, it means that you’re
inviting them to go on a date with you.

62
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,980
Usually this will be some romantic activity
like seeing a film together, or having a meal

63
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,149
at a nice restaurant.

64
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:25,090
Now imagine your crush said yes, and now you’re
dating, or going out with them.

65
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:31,138
If you’re dating or going out with someone,
it means that you’re meeting regularly to

66
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:39,729
do activities together as a couple, for example,
going dancing or out to a bar or restaurant.

67
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:45,310
You can use the phrase 'seeing someone' to
mean the same thing.

68
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:51,639
Going out with someone, dating and seeing
someone all have the same purpose: you want

69
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:58,419
to see if you like each other and if you’re
well suited to be in a relationship together.

70
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:02,900
Now imagine you’re on a date in an Italian
restaurant.

71
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:10,330
There’s nice music playing and candles on
the table, it’s all very romantic!

72
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,770
You and your crush have been flirting and
you find out that you have good chemistry

73
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,758
together.

74
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:20,849
Chemistry is the feeling you get between yourself
and another person.

75
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:28,659
It can be negative, but when we’re talking
about having chemistry in a romantic relationship,

76
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:35,400
it’s positive and means you feel a connection
with the other person, and you’re excited

77
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,409
to spend time with them.

78
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:43,379
If you want to say that you get on well with
your crush, you can say that you click with

79
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:44,779
them.

80
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:50,449
We use the expression 'click with someone'
to say that we are compatible with someone

81
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:53,300
and that you understand each other well.

82
00:05:53,300 --> 00:06:00,759
For example, if you and your date have similar
interests and lots to talk about together,

83
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,900
you can say you click with them.

84
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,630
Let’s review:
If you ask someone out, you are inviting them

85
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,860
to go on a date with you.

86
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:19,999
Seeing someone or going out with someone are
other ways to say you’re dating someone—you’re

87
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:22,529
romantically spending time with them.

88
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:29,069
If you have good chemistry with your date,
you have a good emotional connection with

89
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:30,699
them.

90
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:35,689
And when you click with someone, you get on
with them well and have a good relationship

91
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:37,800
with them.

92
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,839
Part 3: Head over heels in love.

93
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:45,189
Imagine that you’ve been on a few dates
and spent a lot of time together.

94
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:48,409
Now, you’re in a more serious relationship.

95
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:55,188
It wasn’t love at first sight but now you’re
head over heels in love with your new boyfriend

96
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:58,289
or girlfriend and you couldn’t be happier!

97
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:03,419
You feel like you’re made for each other
and you want to spend every minute together.

98
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:08,498
Love at first sight is an instant attraction
to someone.

99
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:15,380
For example, if you watch romantic movies
or read romantic books, you often see examples

100
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,409
of love of first sight.

101
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:25,688
Two people have an instant attraction to each
other and immediately like each other romantically.

102
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:31,180
Head over heels in love is an expression that
means you’re deeply in love with someone.

103
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,839
If you’re head over heels in love with your
boyfriend or girlfriend, you love them very

104
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,979
much!

105
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:44,628
If you use the expression made for each other
to talk about your boyfriend or girlfriend,

106
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:48,110
it means that you are perfectly suited for
each other.

107
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:54,369
For example, you could say you’re made for
each other because you’re very compatible

108
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:58,899
and love spending time together.

109
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:04,349
Now imagine that your friends and family are
so used to seeing you and your boyfriend or

110
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:09,349
girlfriend together that they start calling
him or her your partner.

111
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:18,119
In this instance, a partner is someone you’re
in a serious relationship with, usually either

112
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:20,689
living with or married to.

113
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:27,569
For example, you can call your wife or husband
your partner, or, if you’re in a serious

114
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:34,930
relationship with your girlfriend or boyfriend,
you can call them your partner, too.

115
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:38,719
You can also call your boyfriend or girlfriend
your other half.

116
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:47,000
This uses the idea that you and your boyfriend
or girlfriend are one complete unit together.

117
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,910
You make one whole together, so separately
you are only half.

118
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:57,900
You can call your boyfriend or girlfriend
your other half to say that they are the other

119
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,480
half of you.

120
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,470
If you want to be complimentary to your partner,
you can also call them your better half.

121
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,100
Let’s review:
Head over heels in love means that you love

122
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,900
your boyfriend or girlfriend very much.

123
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:21,090
Love at first sight is when you have an instant
attraction to someone, and when you’re made

124
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,550
for each other, it means you are very well
suited.

125
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:31,829
If you’re in a serious relationship—living
together or married, you can call your husband

126
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,990
or wife your partner.

127
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:41,240
You can also call your boyfriend or girlfriend
your other half, meaning you make one complete

128
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,490
unit together.

129
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:49,020
If you want to be extra nice, you can call
them your better half.

130
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,500
Part 4: Problems in paradise.

131
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,060
You think things are going really well with
your other half—you have good chemistry

132
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,359
and you’re head over heels in love with
them.

133
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,510
Then one day, you go to meet them at the cinema,
but they’re not there!

134
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,620
What’s happened?

135
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,220
Things were going so well…

136
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,160
You ring them but they tell you that they’re
not coming.

137
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,770
You have been stood up.

138
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:21,930
If you’ve been stood up, it means that you
have gone somewhere for a date, but your date

139
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,599
didn’t come.

140
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,030
For example, if you go to a restaurant but
you eat by yourself because your date never

141
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,870
appeared, you’ve been stood up.

142
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:38,770
You are confused about what this means, but
you ask your boyfriend or girlfriend out for

143
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,150
another date.

144
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,500
Then they turn you down.

145
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,650
If you turn someone down, it means that you
don’t want to go on a date with them.

146
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:54,720
For example, if you ask someone to have a
coffee with you and they say no, you have

147
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,330
been turned down.

148
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:03,570
Being turned down might make you feel rejected—you
feel that the other person doesn’t want

149
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,550
to be with you or spend time with you.

150
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:11,670
You’re getting a bit frustrated now—you
thought everything was going well with you

151
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,670
and your other half!

152
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,620
But they tell you that they didn’t feel
the same way.

153
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:23,420
They accuse you of seeing your relationship
through rose-tinted glasses and tell you that

154
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,430
they’re out of your league.

155
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:33,209
If you see something or someone through rose-tinted
glasses, it means that you only see the good

156
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,540
side of something.

157
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,130
You don’t notice anything that might be
wrong.

158
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:45,911
For example, if you see your boyfriend or
girlfriend through rose-tinted glasses, you

159
00:11:45,911 --> 00:11:50,170
think they’re completely perfect and can’t
see anything bad about them.

160
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:55,939
You don’t notice their annoying habits or
the negative side of their personality.

161
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:01,630
If someone is out of your league, it means
they are too good for you.

162
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:07,700
For example, if your crush says that he or
she is out of your league, they think that

163
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,000
you aren’t good enough for them.

164
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,170
It’s not a nice thing to say to someone!

165
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:19,890
Imagine you’re still on the phone, you’re
getting a bit angry now, but before you can

166
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:24,010
say anything, your girlfriend or boyfriend
dumps you!

167
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,370
They have broken your heart and left you single
again.

168
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,750
If someone has decided that they don’t want
to be in a romantic relationship with you

169
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,350
anymore, they have dumped you.

170
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:39,040
This means that they have ended their relationship
with you.

171
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,280
You could also say that they have broken up
with you or ended things with you.

172
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,370
These phrases all mean the same thing.

173
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:53,680
If things were more serious and you loved
the other person, we would say they have broken

174
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,349
your heart.

175
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:00,060
This means that you were in love when they
ended their relationship with you and it has

176
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,579
left you very upset and hurt.

177
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:07,180
Let’s review:
If you’ve been stood up, it means that your

178
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,000
date isn’t coming and hasn’t told you.

179
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,260
If you don’t want to go on a date with somebody,
you would turn them down.

180
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,950
Being turned down might make you feel rejected
and unwanted.

181
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:28,890
If you’re seeing your relationship through
rose-tinted glasses, you’re seeing it as

182
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:33,170
perfect but not realistically.

183
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:38,280
If you’re out of someone’s league, it
means that you’re too good for them, and

184
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:45,240
if you don’t want to be in a relationship
anymore, you can dump your boyfriend or girlfriend.

185
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,740
You could also say that you broke up, or that
you decided to end things.

186
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,610
But be careful!

187
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,820
If they’re in love with you, you might break
their heart.

188
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,950
Now we’ve reached the end of our lesson.

189
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,330
I hope you’re not too heartbroken!

190
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:07,130
Now you should be able to talk about and understand
all the stages of a relationship using different

191
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,160
words and expressions.

192
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,490
Thanks very much for watching!

193
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,920
I hope that you have found it useful.
