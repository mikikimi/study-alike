1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:02,860
Hello?

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,330
Hello, can I speak to Kasia, please?

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,360
Yes, speaking.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,990
Hi, Kasia, it’s Oli here.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,240
Oh, hello!

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,420
I wanted to ask: I need some English phrases
for talking on the phone.

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,360
Do you think you could help me with that?

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,660
Of course!

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,500
What do you need to learn?

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,000
Well, everything, I suppose.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
No problem!

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,279
Shall we start?

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,999
Yeah, why not?

14
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:28,720
Hi, I’m Oli.

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,619
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

16
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:34,790
Let’s learn how to speak English on the
phone.

17
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,790
In this lesson, you can learn how to deal
with common situations and problems when you’re

18
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,760
talking on the phone in English.

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,260
You’ll see four dialogues, and then we’ll
explain the vocabulary and phrases that we

20
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,260
use.

21
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:55,339
This way, you’ll learn everything you need
to make phone calls in English!

22
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:01,710
Let’s start by showing you how to make an
informal phone call, for example to a friend

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,880
or a colleague you know well.

24
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,480
Hello?
Oli, hi!

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,600
Sorry, who’s this?

26
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,880
It’s Kasia!

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,600
Oh, hi!

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,360
Sorry, didn’t have your number saved.

29
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,320
No worries.

30
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,740
Listen: some of us are going rafting this
weekend.

31
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,020
Do you want to come?

32
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,340
Wow, that sounds great!

33
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,340
Yeah, sure.

34
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,340
Brilliant!

35
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,490
I’ll text you the details.

36
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,929
Okay, cheers for the invite, see you then
I guess.

37
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:28,930
Bye!

38
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,070
Let’s look at the whole dialogue.

39
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,339
What do you notice?

40
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,200
First, I answered with a simple hello.

41
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,070
This is common if you’re answering the phone
informally and you don’t know who’s calling.

42
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:50,089
I also used an informal way to ask who was
calling.

43
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,780
And I used an informal way to give my name.

44
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,460
If you’re calling your friend, don’t say,

45
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,800
I’m Kasia

46
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,460
Instead, say,

47
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,300
It’s Kasia.

48
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:07,390
Next, you can see that Kasia tells me why
she’s calling in a very simple way.

49
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,989
Also, look at the whole dialogue.

50
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,889
It’s quite short, right?

51
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:15,650
This is common in informal phone calls.

52
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,450
We don’t ask how are you or anything like
that.

53
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,578
It’s not bad to ask how are you, of course!

54
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:27,180
But, it’s not necessary in an informal phone
call if you know each other well.

55
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,269
You can also see many examples of informal
language that we both used, for example wow,

56
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:40,040
yeah, cheers, I guess, or using invite as
a noun instead of invitation.

57
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,060
Finally, we ended the conversation quickly
and simply.

58
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,580
We used simple, informal goodbye words: see
you and bye.

59
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:59,640
Next, let’s look at how can you make a formal
phone call, so you can see the difference.

60
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,200
Good afternoon, Oxford Online English, how
can I help?

61
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,000
Hello, could I speak to Michael Hart, please?

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,740
Who’s calling, please?

63
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,200
My name is Oli Redman and

64
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,000
I’m calling concerning a proposal which
Mr Hart sent to me.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,200
One moment, please…

66
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,000
I’m afraid he’s not available right now.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,080
Would it be alright for him to call you back
in about 30 minutes?

68
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes, that would be fine.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,300
And does he have your number?

70
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,400
Yes, he called me last week, so he must have
it.

71
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,360
That’s fine.

72
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,200
He’ll call you in half an hour or so.

73
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,399
Is there anything else I can do for you?

74
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,600
No, that’s all.

75
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,579
Thank you for your help.

76
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,600
You’re welcome.

77
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,799
Thanks for calling, and have a nice day!

78
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,000
And to you.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,400
Goodbye!

80
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,000
Can you see the difference between this and
the first dialogue you heard?

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,400
First, I answered the phone with a longer
greeting.

82
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,200
Instead of just hello, I used a full phrase.

83
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,200
I also said the name of the company—this
is common when answering the phone at work.

84
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,000
You could also say your full name, like this:

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,200
Hello, Kasia Warszynska.

86
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Or, you could say the name of your manager,
like this:

87
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,000
Good morning, Anna Gilbert’s office.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,220
You can also see that you use different phrases
to ask who’s calling, or to say who you

89
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,500
are:

90
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,600
Who’s calling, please?

91
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,200
Or: My name is…

92
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:33,440
In this case, I used My name is... because
I was introducing myself for the first time.

93
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,490
If you’re talking to someone who you’ve
met before, you could use this is and give

94
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,669
your name.

95
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:43,320
For example, I could say:

96
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
This is Oli.

97
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,979
Oli also said why he was calling using a longer,
more formal phrase:

98
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,810
I’m calling concerning…

99
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,180
You could also use something like:

100
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,240
I would like to ask about…

101
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,520
Or: I wanted to discuss … with you.

102
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,120
In general, you can see that the dialogue
is much longer.

103
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,710
We spoke more, and also used longer sentences.

104
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:16,549
You can see many examples of formal language
that we both used, like I’m afraid he’s

105
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:23,439
not available, would it be alright to…,
or that would be fine.

106
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,759
Finally, the goodbye is also much longer.

107
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,970
I started ending the call by asking:

108
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,580
Is there anything else I can do for you?

109
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,820
Compare this to the first dialogue, where
we ended the call very quickly and simply.

110
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:45,430
In this dialogue, ending the call took several
sentences.

111
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,210
We also used more formal goodbye phrases,
like:

112
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,030
Thanks for your help.

113
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,549
Thanks for calling.

114
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,409
Have a nice day!/And to you!

115
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:58,979
Or: Goodbye

116
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:05,740
So you can see two important differences here:
the language is almost totally different,

117
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,900
and also the style is different, because everything
is longer.

118
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:15,888
Next, let’s look at another dialogue to
see how to deal with a common problem when

119
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,680
talking on the phone in English.

120
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,020
Hello?

121
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,020
Kasia, hi it's Oli.

122
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,240
Hi Oli.

123
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,460
Sorry, say that again.

124
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,318
I said, we’re thinking of going to the cinema.

125
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,440
The sound’s very quiet.

126
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,580
Can you speak up a bit? Hello?

127
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,219
Sorry, I really can’t hear.

128
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,760
How about now?

129
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,320
Ah, yes, that’s better!

130
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,300
Sorry, I’m in the subway, and the signal’s
not so good.

131
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,560
So, what were you saying?

132
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,479
I wanted to say…

133
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:58,030
Hold on, my battery’s about to die.

134
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,198
Can I call you back later?

135
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:07,240
Sure, I’ll be free till…

136
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:15,100
First, a question for you: was this dialogue
formal or informal?

137
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,460
It was informal.

138
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:23,479
Here, you can see some common problems you
might have talking on the phone in English.

139
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,860
At the beginning, I couldn’t hear Oli’s
question.

140
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,280
So, I said:

141
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,159
Sorry, say that again.

142
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,210
You could use many different phrases here,
like:

143
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,210
What was that?

144
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,169
Or: What did you say?

145
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:41,960
In a more formal conversation, you could say
something like:

146
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,530
I’m sorry, could you repeat that?

147
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,609
Or: Could you say that again, please?

148
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,919
Next, Kasia couldn’t hear me because the
sound was too low.

149
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,159
She asked:

150
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:57,560
Can you speak up a bit?

151
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,120
Speak up means to speak more loudly.

152
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,580
Mrore formally, you could say something like:

153
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,039
The sound is low.

154
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,969
Would you mind speaking a little more loudly?

155
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:14,620
When speaking formally, you need to be more
indirect, which means you need longer sentences.

156
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,919
We were having problems because Oli was on
the subway.

157
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,260
Do you remember what he said?

158
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,400
The signal’s not so good.

159
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:24,930
You could also say:

160
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,520
I don’t have much signal.

161
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,159
Or: There’s not much reception here.

162
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,760
Finally, he ran out of battery.

163
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,299
He really should have charged his phone before
he went out!

164
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,229
Hey, that’s not my fault!

165
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,980
And anyway, I said I’d call you back.

166
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,180
And did you?

167
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,079
Finally, what if you call someone, and they’re
not there?

168
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,839
Hello, OOE productions, can I help?

169
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,780
Hello, this is Kasia Warzsynska.

170
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,780
I’m calling for Pieter Okker.

171
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,780
Is he available?

172
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,500
Unfortunately he’s busy at the moment.

173
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,380
Would you like to leave a message, or should
I get him to call you back later?

174
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,380
Um…

175
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,380
Can I leave him a message?

176
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,820
It’s quite important.

177
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,700
Of course.

178
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,270
Could you ask him to double check the hotel
reservations for the Italy conference?

179
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,800
He’ll know what I mean.

180
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,160
Very well.

181
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
Anything else?

182
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,621
No, that’s everything, but do please make
sure he gets it as soon as possible.

183
00:09:26,621 --> 00:09:30,189
I’ll pass your message on as soon as he’s
free.

184
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,310
Thank you.

185
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,339
Would you also like him to call you back?

186
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,610
Yes, please.

187
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,300
If you could get him to call me at my office,
that would be wonderful.

188
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,359
No problem at all.

189
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,300
Thanks so much.

190
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,800
You’re welcome, bye-bye now!

191
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,079
Bye!

192
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:50,630
Let’s start with the same question: was
this dialogue more formal, or more informal?

193
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,840
It was more formal this time.

194
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:57,070
In this dialogue, I wanted to speak to someone,
but he wasn’t there.

195
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,030
Oli took a message for me.

196
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,660
Do you remember the question he asked?

197
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,860
He said:

198
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,830
Would you like to leave a message?

199
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,280
You could also say:

200
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,880
Can I take a message?

201
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,540
Should I give him a message?

202
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,480
What can you say to answer this question?

203
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,760
You could say something like:

204
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,400
Can I leave him a message?

205
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,730
Or: Could you pass on a message for me?

206
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,950
Then, give your message:

207
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,330
Can you ask him to…?

208
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,160
Could you tell her that…?

209
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,300
Just let him know that…

210
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,040
Here’s a full example:

211
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,870
Could you tell her that I’ll be arriving
at five o’clock, instead of half seven?

212
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:49,640
You might also say how important your message
is, particularly if it is very important!

213
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,140
For example:

214
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,630
Please make sure he gets it as soon as possible;
it’s really important.

215
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:00,340
It’s urgent, so please tell her as soon
as you can.

216
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,410
If it’s not so important, you could say
something like:

217
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,740
It’s not urgent, so just let him know when
he’s free.

218
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Hello?

219
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,920
Hi, yeah, it’s Oli again.

220
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,329
Hi, Oli!

221
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,850
Did you learn everything you needed about
how to talk on the phone in English?

222
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,890
Yeah, great lesson, thanks Kasia!

223
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,610
You’re welcome, glad you liked it!

224
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,560
Where could I find more free English lessons
like this?

225
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,560
You should definitely go to Oxford Online
English.com.

226
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,239
There are lots of great free English lessons
there.

227
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,510
What did you say?

228
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,790
I couldn’t hear you.

229
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,740
I said Oxford Online English.com.

230
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,180
Ah, great, thanks!

231
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,620
No problem, bye!

232
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,590
See you!
