00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,420
Hi, I'm Niamh.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,900
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,170
In this lesson, you can learn to talk about
sports in English.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,250
Are you a sport fan?

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,730
What sports do you like playing?

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:24,029
Sport is a common topic in English conversation,
so whether you like sport or not, it’s good

7
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:30,870
to have something to say and be able to to
ask some questions about sport.

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:38,510
First question: do you like sport?

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,260
Think about how you could answer.

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,159
You could say something like:

11
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,260
I’ve always been really sporty.

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,858
I enjoy some sports, though I’m not a fanatic.

13
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,940
I’m not that into sport, to be honest.

14
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,549
Do you know what the words sporty and fanatic
mean?

15
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:10,310
Sporty describes someone who’s really interested
in sport, and who often plays sport.

16
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:18,340
A fanatic literally means someone who only
cares about one thing.

17
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:24,770
You can use it with an indirect meaning to
describe someone who’s really interested

18
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,280
in something.

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,600
So if you say, I enjoy some sports, though
I’m not a fanatic, you mean that you like

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,500
sport, but it’s not the most important thing
for you.

21
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,270
Okay, you have three sentences.

22
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,560
Which is closest to your opinion?

23
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:52,520
These are good sentences to start talking,
but remember that you should always add more

24
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,249
detail if possible!

25
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:59,798
Let’s add some reasons or details to the
three sentences you saw:

26
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:02,329
I’ve always been really sporty.

27
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:09,728
I loved sport when I was a kid, and I still
play most weeks.

28
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,200
I enjoy some sports, though I’m not a fanatic.

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,959
Playing football or something like that can
be fun, but I don’t want to take it too

30
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:19,470
seriously.

31
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,170
I’m not that into sport, to be honest.

32
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,809
I’m not very athletic and I find watching
sport quite boring.

33
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,959
These are already much better.

34
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:40,019
If you can add reasons or details when you
speak, your speaking will sound better, too!

35
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:44,860
Let’s look at some useful words here:

36
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:52,849
Athletic describes someone who’s in good
shape and who enjoys exercise and sport.

37
00:02:52,849 --> 00:03:00,070
If you say I’m not very athletic you mean
that you aren’t very good at sport, and

38
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,340
probably you don’t really enjoy it, either.

39
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:12,620
Another very useful phrase is I find…, as
in I find watching sport quite boring.

40
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,430
This is a very good way to give your opinion
about something.

41
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,810
For example:

42
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:25,540
I find watching snooker weirdly fascinating.

43
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:32,530
I find swimming very relaxing.

44
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:38,900
I found volleyball much more difficult to
play than I was expecting.

45
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,959
So, what about you?

46
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,709
Do you like sport?

47
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:50,379
Pause the video and make at least two sentences.

48
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:53,760
Remember to add reasons and details.

49
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
Okay?

50
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:05,980
Next, we’re going to look at how to talk
about different kinds of sport in more detail.

51
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:14,488
How many team sports can you name in English?

52
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:17,690
What did you think of?

53
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:24,540
Maybe you thought of team sports like football,
basketball, hockey, volleyball or cricket.

54
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:30,700
Do you play any team sports?

55
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,050
Usually with team sports, we use the verb
play.

56
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,330
You could say something like:

57
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,180
I play football.

58
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,190
I like playing basketball.

59
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,020
I really enjoy playing cricket.

60
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:51,669
But, of course, these answers are much too
short and lacking in detail!

61
00:04:51,670 --> 00:05:03,000
So, think about these questions: where do
you play, how often and who with?

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,790
By answering these simple questions, you can
make your answer much more detailed and interesting,

63
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,610
like this:

64
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:18,030
I play 5-a-side football with some friends
every Sunday.

65
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:24,520
We rent a sports hall and play a 60-minute
match.

66
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,440
Or, I like playing basketball.

67
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,180
I play for a local team.

68
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:40,620
We train three times a week and have matches
once or twice a week, sometimes in our town,

69
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,070
and sometimes in other cities.

70
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,450
Do you get the idea?

71
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,990
Let’s do one more example, just to make
sure:

72
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,350
I really enjoy playing cricket.

73
00:05:53,350 --> 00:06:01,650
I joined an online group and we meet in the
park once a week for a game.

74
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,090
Different people play every week, which keeps
things interesting!

75
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:14,900
These examples give you some useful language
you can use when you speak.

76
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,539
For example:

77
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,580
I play for a local team.

78
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,280
We play a 60-minute match once a week.

79
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,030
I joined an online group.

80
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,690
You can change these to make them true for
you, like this:

81
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:36,240
I play for my school team.

82
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,520
We play a friendly match a couple of times
a month.

83
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,520
I joined a club near my home.

84
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,340
So, what about you?

85
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:52,560
Use the language with this section and talk
about team sports you like.

86
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,090
If you don’t play team sports now, or if
you don’t like team sports, try to talk

87
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,909
about a friend or relative.

88
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,830
Pause the video and make your answer.

89
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:11,710
You can also write down your answer if you
want extra practice!

90
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,859
How was that?

91
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:21,380
Next, a question: what’s the opposite of
a team sport?

92
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:29,490
There’s the answer: individual sports.

93
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:36,300
Can you name five different individual sports
in English?

94
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:46,060
Maybe you said things like tennis, badminton,
swimming, boxing, running or gymnastics.

95
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:55,880
Of course, some of these can be team sports
as well, like tennis or badminton.

96
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:01,810
With individual sports, you may need to use
different verbs.

97
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:11,830
You play tennis and play badminton, but you
go swimming, go running, do boxing and do

98
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,500
gymnastics.

99
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,070
A good general rule is:

100
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:27,380
play plus ball sports
go plus an activity ending -ing

101
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,960
do plus other activities

102
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,299
And yes, you say do boxing even though boxing
ends with -ing.

103
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,679
Remember: it’s a general rule!

104
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,880
It will work most of the time, but not every
time.

105
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,819
So, think about the same questions you answered
in the last section.

106
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:55,630
What sports do you like doing?

107
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:02,800
Where do you do them, how often, and who with?

108
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,359
Look at one possible answer:

109
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,060
I go running by myself or with my husband.

110
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,229
I go once a week or so.

111
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:17,569
I like going running in the park or just around
the streets.

112
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:21,180
What do you think—is this a good answer?

113
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:27,260
It’s not bad, but it’s a bit repetitive
and simple.

114
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,269
Every sentence starts with the same word (‘I’),
which sounds unnatural.

115
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:35,510
How could you improve it?

116
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,569
Here’s one suggestion:

117
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:47,000
I like going running once a week or so, sometimes
in the park or just around the streets.

118
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,650
Sometimes I run with my husband, or sometimes
I just go by myself.

119
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,760
What do you think?

120
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,370
Does that sound better?

121
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,260
Hopefully, it does.

122
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:06,720
This answer uses slightly longer sentences
and more varied language.

123
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:14,520
This sounds more natural, is more interesting
to listen to, and will also help you if you’re

124
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,060
taking an English exam such as IELTS.

125
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,099
Let’s look at another example:

126
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,350
I do boxing at my local gym.

127
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,660
I go to classes two or three times a week.

128
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:36,260
I don’t know the other people in the class.

129
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,120
What do you think?

130
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,139
Could you make this answer better?

131
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:49,500
Again, it’s quite repetitive, because every
sentence is a simple sentence starting with

132
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,819
‘I’.

133
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:57,060
Think about how you could make this answer
more natural-sounding.

134
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:03,649
Pause the video and think about your answer
if you want.

135
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:04,829
Any ideas?

136
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:08,138
Here’s one suggestion:

137
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:15,410
I go to boxing classes at my local gym two
or three times a week.

138
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:20,810
There are several other people who go to the
same classes, although I don’t know them

139
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,660
well.

140
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,350
Sound better?

141
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:35,050
Again, you can see that using slightly longer
sentences and using varied sentence structures

142
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:41,258
can make your spoken English sound more natural
and interesting.

143
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:50,480
Okay, so now you can talk about different
sports you like, and say a little about them.

144
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:59,360
Next question: why do you like the sports
you like?

145
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,399
Why do people do sport?

146
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,899
How many different reasons can you think of?

147
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:10,730
Some people do sport to socialize.

148
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,699
Others love to compete.

149
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:17,709
For some people, sport is just a way to get
fit and stay healthy.

150
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:20,050
What about you?

151
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,839
Why do you do sport?

152
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:28,069
Let’s look at two sample answers:

153
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:31,849
I play 5-a-side football with some friends
every Sunday.

154
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,600
For me, the most important thing is the social
side.

155
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,029
I don’t really care about the game, or who
wins.

156
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:46,139
I just like having a laugh with some good
friends and getting a beer afterwards.

157
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,959
Here’s another:

158
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,599
I play basketball for a local team.

159
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,769
Personally, I love the competition.

160
00:12:55,769 --> 00:13:02,389
There’s no better feeling than winning a
difficult match, or beating a team who beat

161
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:03,389
you last time.

162
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:13,149
I know some people say that sport’s about
taking part, not winning, but that’s not

163
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:15,240
true for me.

164
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,800
If you don’t play to win, what’s the point?

165
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,748
What do you think?

166
00:13:22,749 --> 00:13:25,220
Are these good answers?

167
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,209
Hopefully, you can see that these are good!

168
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:37,540
Talking about your personal feelings and opinions
is your chance to really go into detail and

169
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,540
use some interesting language.

170
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:48,199
Let’s look at some key words and phrases
from the examples you’ve seen:

171
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:54,319
For me, the most important thing is…

172
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:57,199
I just like…

173
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:06,118
Personally, …
There’s no better feeling than…

174
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:10,980
You can use these phrases to give your opinion
about many different things.

175
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,380
For example:

176
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,329
For me, the most important thing is just getting
outdoors and being active.

177
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:24,089
I just like the feeling of overcoming a challenge.

178
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:29,449
Personally, I’ve always loved being in the
water.

179
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:33,899
There’s no better feeling than when you’re
tired after a good game.

180
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:34,899
What about you?

181
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:44,089
Can you describe why you do sport, and why
you like the sports you like?

182
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:48,430
Pause the video, and try to make two or three
sentences.

183
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:53,040
Use the language from this section if you
can.

184
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,748
Alright, so now you can say quite a lot about
sport.

185
00:14:58,749 --> 00:15:04,689
Let’s put everything together.

186
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:08,019
To make a longer answer, you need to:

187
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:13,130
Talk about your general attitude towards sport.

188
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,749
Talk about which sports you like.

189
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:23,420
Say where and how often you do sport, and
who you do them with.

190
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,180
Talk about why you do sport.

191
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,540
Here’s one example:

192
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,550
I enjoy some sports, though I’m not a fanatic.

193
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:39,079
Playing football or something like that can
be fun, but I don’t want to take it too

194
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:40,748
seriously.

195
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:46,450
I play 5-a-side football with some friends
every Sunday.

196
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,800
We rent a sports hall and play a 60-minute
match.

197
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,349
For me, the most important thing is the social
side.

198
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,870
I don’t really care about the game, or who
wins.

199
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:06,490
I just like having a laugh with some good
friends and getting a beer afterwards.

200
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:12,439
This example only uses language from the lesson.

201
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:20,170
You can see how you can build an interesting,
detailed answer using simple ideas.

202
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:25,399
Let’s do one more example, using original
language and ideas:

203
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:31,790
I don’t really like sport that much, but
fitness and staying healthy are important

204
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,790
to me.

205
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:37,439
That’s why I go swimming and do some weight
training regularly.

206
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:42,910
I mostly just exercise by myself at the sports
centre.

207
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,819
Personally, I just do it because I feel I
have to.

208
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:52,279
I don’t really enjoy it, although I don’t
mind it, either.

209
00:16:52,279 --> 00:17:00,370
I do like feeling healthy and fit, but exercising
always feels more like work than something

210
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,370
fun.

211
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,589
Okay, now it’s your turn.

212
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:08,339
Make a longer answer like the two you’ve
just seen.

213
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:15,409
Follow the same structure, and use the language
from the lesson if you can.

214
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:20,470
Don’t forget that you can write your answer
down if you want extra practice.

215
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:27,250
Also, it’s a good idea to practise your
answer several times, until it’s really

216
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,900
fluent and comfortable.

217
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:36,150
Then, if you’re really serious, don’t
just make one answer!

218
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:41,510
Make several answers, talking about different
sports.

219
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:46,760
Even better, make an answer from someone else’s
point of view.

220
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,330
If you practise like this, your English will
get better very fast!
