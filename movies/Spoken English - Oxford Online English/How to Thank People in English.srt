00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,610
Hi, I’m Justin.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,760
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,889
In this lesson, you can learn how to thank
people in English.

4
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:14,129
You’ll learn different ways to say thank
you in formal, neutral, or informal situations.

5
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:18,320
You’ll also see how to make sure you sound
polite and natural when you thank someone,

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,470
or respond to a thank-you.

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,630
Ready?

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,119
Let’s get going!

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,880
I just wanted to say thank you for all your
hard work on this project.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,040
I really appreciate the contribution you’ve
made.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,360
Oh, well, that’s nice of you; thank you
for saying so!

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,640
Thank you very much for the invitation.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,270
It was our pleasure, and thank you for coming.

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,320
I’m very grateful for all your help.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,750
Oh, don’t worry about it; it was nothing!

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,790
Here, you saw different ways to thank someone
in formal situations.

17
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,280
Can you remember any of the phrases you heard?

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,760
In a formal situation, you could say:

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,830
I just wanted to say thank you for
Thank you very much for…

20
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,780
I really appreciate…

21
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,220
I’m very grateful for…

22
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,730
After for, you can use a noun, or an -ing
verb, like this:

23
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,730
I just wanted to say thank you for your help.

24
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:24,290
Or: I just wanted to say thank you for helping
us.

25
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:29,270
After appreciate, you can use a noun, or that
plus a clause.

26
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,490
For example:

27
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,850
I really appreciate your support.

28
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,280
Or: I really appreciate that you made such
an effort to support me.

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,360
When someone thanks you, you need to respond.

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,000
The most basic way is to say You’re welcome.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,210
But, what can you do in a more formal situation?

32
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:52,630
In a truly formal situation, the most common
way to respond is to thank the other person

33
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,449
for something else.

34
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,000
For example, in one of the dialogues, you
heard one person say:

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,680
Thank you very much for the invitation.

36
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,230
The other person replied:

37
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,920
It was our pleasure, and thank you for coming.

38
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,720
You can use phrases like you’re welcome
or it’s my pleasure in formal situations,

39
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,380
but it’s also good to add a second thank-you.

40
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,660
Alternatively, you could say something like
this:

41
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,370
Oh, don’t worry about it; it was nothing!

42
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,810
What do you think this shows?

43
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,730
Saying something like this is a way to say,
“Stop being so serious and formal.”

44
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,679
It shows that the other person doesn’t need
to thank you in a very formal way.

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,110
This is an important point: remember that
formal language is not always more polite.

46
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,700
Formal language can sound cold or distant
if you use it in the wrong situation.

47
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,829
You might need formal thank-yous in some companies
or work situations, although many companies

48
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,950
have a more relaxed personal culture these
days.

49
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:02,339
You might also use them in some social situations,
for example a wedding or party where you don’t

50
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,780
know the people very well.

51
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,880
Most of the time, you’ll need to use neutral
thank-you phrases.

52
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,640
Let’s look!

53
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,899
Here’s your camera.

54
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,680
Thanks for letting me borrow it!

55
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,240
No problem!

56
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,879
Excuse me, where’s the entrance to the metro?

57
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,590
It’s right there, just over the street.

58
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,590
Thank you!

59
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,800
You’re welcome!

60
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,740
How’d you enjoy the food?

61
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,750
It was great!

62
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,750
Thanks!

63
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,750
My pleasure!

64
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,830
Let’s start with a question: what does ‘neutral’
mean?

65
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:39,379
‘Neutral’ describes language which is
neither formal nor informal.

66
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:44,329
Neutral language is the simple language which
you can use in almost any situation.

67
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,440
In the dialogues, you heard three ways to
thank someone using neutral language, and

68
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,200
three responses you can use when someone thanks
you.

69
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,420
Do you remember the phrases you heard?

70
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,820
To thank someone using neutral language, you
could say:

71
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,019
Thanks for…

72
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,580
Thank you!

73
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,540
Or, thanks!

74
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,519
To respond, you could say:

75
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,400
No problem!

76
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,220
You’re welcome!

77
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,100
Or, my pleasure!

78
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,120
Easy, right?

79
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,639
Neutral language is the most common form.

80
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,978
You can also see that in neutral situations,
the interactions are much shorter.

81
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:25,349
In formal situations, you need to speak more.

82
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:26,770
For example:

83
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,089
I just wanted to say thank you for letting
me use your camera.

84
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:32,830
It was a great help to me.

85
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,808
This is formal, and you can see that it’s
quite long.

86
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,419
In a neutral situation, you can just say:

87
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,040
Thanks for letting me borrow your camera!

88
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,760
It’s much shorter and simpler.

89
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:50,240
Next, what about informal situations?

90
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,860
Your coffee’s ready.

91
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,380
I put it on the table.

92
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,680
(mmm hmm)

93
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,139
I got you a chocolate bar.

94
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,759
Oh, thanks.

95
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,330
Did you get a haircut?

96
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,258
Looks good!

97
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:10,620
You can see that in informal situations, you
often might not say thank you at all!

98
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,639
You use informal language with people you
know well.

99
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,570
In these situations, you often don’t need
to be traditionally polite.

100
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:23,949
So, you might say thank you another way, by
making a noise, smiling, nodding, or something

101
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,409
like that.

102
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:28,289
You can use thanks in informal situations.

103
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:30,530
In British English, you can say cheers.

104
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:35,349
In informal situations, you often don’t
respond to a thank-you, so you don’t use

105
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,990
phrases like you’re welcome or my pleasure.

106
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,389
Of course, this depends on the situation and
the people.

107
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:47,089
If you’re not sure, then use neutral language:
say thanks or thank you.

108
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:53,039
Now, you’ve seen how to thank people in
English in formal, neutral and informal situations.

109
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,120
It’s important to get the tone right, but
there’s another point which is important

110
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,509
when you thank someone in spoken English.

111
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:03,979
Can you guess what I mean?

112
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:05,429
I bought you a present.

113
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:07,878
Thank you so much!

114
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,620
I bought you a present.

115
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,379
Thank you so much!

116
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:13,369
I bought you a present.

117
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:15,920
Thank you so much.

118
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,720
Of course, when you thank someone, the whole
point is to be polite.

119
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,899
The words and phrases you choose are important,
but your intonation is possibly even more

120
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,299
significant.

121
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,280
You saw in the dialogues that the same phrase
can have very different meanings with different

122
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,789
intonation.

123
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:38,039
Using polite phrases means nothing if your
tone and body language don’t match your

124
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:39,039
words.

125
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,500
For example:
I’m so incredibly grateful for everything

126
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,720
you’ve done for me and I don’t know how
I can ever thank you.

127
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,559
If I say that to you, you know I’m not being
polite; it doesn’t matter that I’m using

128
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:55,369
very formal language.

129
00:06:55,369 --> 00:06:58,700
Similarly, if you hear:
Wow!

130
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,259
Thanks!

131
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:05,979
The language is more informal, but the tone
makes it sound genuine, and therefore polite.

132
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:12,139
However, sounding more excited or sincere
is not always better: if you overuse this

133
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,409
intonation, it can sound fake.

134
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:20,051
You need to match your language and your intonation
to the situation, and then you’ll sound

135
00:07:20,051 --> 00:07:23,279
polite and natural when you thank people in
English!

136
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:29,029
Now, we want to know something: how many different
languages can you say thank you in?

137
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:32,849
Tell us in the comments, and let’s see who
knows the most different words!
