00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,740
Hi, I’m Martin.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,840
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:12,600
In this lesson, you can learn how to talk
about the future in English.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,450
What are you doing this evening?

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,189
What are your plans for next year?

6
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:20,850
Who will win the next World Cup?

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,680
In this class, you’ll learn to answer these
and other questions about the future in clear,

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,609
natural, correct English.

9
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:34,230
You’ll see many simple phrases which you
can learn to help you talk about the future

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,860
in English in any situation!

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,840
Let’s start with a simple question: what
are you doing this weekend?

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,680
What are you doing this weekend?

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,050
I’m meeting some friends for lunch on Saturday,
and then we’re going to the theatre.

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,890
Sounds good!

15
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,450
What about Sunday?

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,450
Not sure.

17
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,680
I don’t have plans yet.

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,160
What about you—doing anything fun?

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,620
I’m going away for the weekend.

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,620
Really?

21
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,620
Nice!

22
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,620
Where are you going?

23
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,620
Berlin!

24
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,020
I found some cheap flights.

25
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,910
Let’s look at some useful language you saw
in this dialogue:

26
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,229
What are you doing this weekend?

27
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,220
This is a very common question.

28
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,640
You can change it and use it in different
situations, like this:

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,750
What are you doing tomorrow?

30
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,750
What are you doing tonight?

31
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,940
What are you doing next Wednesday evening?

32
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,640
How could you answer these three questions?

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,960
Here are some possible answers:

34
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,880
I’m working in the morning, then I’m playing
football in the park with some friends.

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,399
I’m going for a beer with some people from
work.

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Next Wednesday?

37
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
No idea!

38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,770
I haven’t made any plans yet.

39
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:57,860
Can you see what verb form you need in these
questions and answers?

40
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,580
You often need the present continuous tense.

41
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,840
You can use the present continuous to talk
about the future, even though it’s a present

42
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
tense.

43
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,640
You can use the present continuous to talk
about plans if you know where or when something

44
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,100
will happen.

45
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,390
Usually, you use it to talk about the near
future.

46
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:19,480
However, you can also use it for plans which
are further in the future, like holiday plans.

47
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,910
Let’s see some examples of this:
Are you going anywhere next summer?

48
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,720
We’re going to Cornwall.

49
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,420
It’s the same place we go every year.

50
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,660
I’ve heard it’s beautiful there!

51
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,850
How long are you staying there?

52
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,000
Just a week.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,390
Are you going in July?

54
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,899
I’m thinking about going, just for two or
three days.

55
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,410
No, we’re going in August.

56
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,090
Who are you going with?

57
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,980
I’m going with two old college friends.

58
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,709
Well, if you come in August, we can show you
around!

59
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,030
I’m working in August, unfortunately.

60
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:59,430
Here, you heard useful questions to ask someone
about their vacation plans:

61
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,810
Are you going anywhere this summer?

62
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,830
How long are you staying there?

63
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,760
Who are you going with?

64
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,390
Can you answer these three questions?

65
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:15,500
Pause the video and make your own answers.

66
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,790
Now, put your answers together in one sentence,
like this:

67
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,560
I’m going to Egypt for 10 days with a group
of friends.

68
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,510
Next, add some more details about what you’re
planning to do!

69
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,560
For example:

70
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,040
I’m going to Egypt for 10 days with a group
of friends.

71
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,130
We’re planning to do some sightseeing around
Cairo, then we’re going to do a boat trip

72
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,870
on the Nile.

73
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,030
Can you see something different in this sentence?

74
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,500
We said:

75
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,709
We’re planning to do some sightseeing around
Cairo.

76
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:53,330
We’re going to do a boat trip on the Nile.

77
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:59,920
Here, you’re using two verbs: planning to
do and going to do.

78
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,190
Do you know why?

79
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,880
Let’s see the answer:

80
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,780
You use the present
continuous to talk about plans if you know

81
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,790
where or when something will happen.

82
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,659
That means you often need the present continuous
to talk about plans in the near future.

83
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,920
What about plans in the future if you don’t
know exactly where or when things will happen?

84
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,780
Is it true?

85
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,039
You quit?

86
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
Yes!

87
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,120
I’m done with this place, and it feels great!

88
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,270
What are you going to do now?

89
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:40,799
You know, first of all I’m planning to take
some time to rest and recover my energy.

90
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,990
I’ve been so stressed the last few months.

91
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,210
Sure, but then how are you going to find a
new job?

92
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,638
Actually, I’d like to start my own business.

93
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,889
I’m tired of working for other people.

94
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:55,889
Really?

95
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:58,410
What kind of thing are you thinking of doing?

96
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,600
My dream is to have my own small marketing
firm.

97
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,020
I’m hoping to start with freelancing, and
then build up from there.

98
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,190
Wow—good luck!

99
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:17,810
Here, you saw useful phrases to talk about
plans if you don’t know all the details

100
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,810
yet.

101
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:24,700
Do you remember any of the questions and phrases?

102
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,000
Here’s some of the key language you saw:

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,230
What are you going to do now?

104
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,430
I’m planning to take some time to rest.

105
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,160
I’d like to start my own business.

106
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,020
My dream is to have my own marketing firm.

107
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:46,940
You can change these sentences to fit different
situations, like this:

108
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,020
What are you going to do after you graduate?

109
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,859
I’m planning to buy an apartment next year.

110
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,780
I’d like to learn to scuba dive one day.

111
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:03,840
My dream is to live near the sea, where it’s
sunny all year round.

112
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,289
You can use these to talk about future plans,
dreams and ideas.

113
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,480
What about you?

114
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:19,400
What are your plans, dreams and ideas for
the future?

115
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,229
Use these templates and make four sentences
about your life and your plans.

116
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:27,610
Say the sentences aloud, or write them down,
or both!

117
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,690
Now, you know how to talk about all kinds
of future plans in English.

118
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:39,400
What other things do you need to talk about
in the future?

119
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,229
What time does the concert start?

120
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:43,419
8.00, so we need to leave at 6.30.

121
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:45,599
Is there a bus?

122
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,010
Yeah, I think it leaves at 6.45, and it gets
there around 7.30.

123
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,180
What time does it finish?

124
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,550
It’s supposed to end at ten.

125
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,009
The last bus back leaves at 10.15, so we’ll
have to hurry.

126
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:03,790
Here, you saw us talking about schedules.

127
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,150
Do you remember what language you heard?

128
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,669
You can use the present simple to talk about
future schedules or timetables.

129
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:14,669
For example:

130
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:16,729
What time does the concert start?

131
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:20,210
The bus gets there around 7.30.

132
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,460
The last bus leaves at 10.15.

133
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:31,070
You can use this to talk about public transport,
class timetables, work schedules, events,

134
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,940
or anything else which runs on a timetable.

135
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,320
For example:

136
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,669
Our class starts at eleven thirty.

137
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,508
What time is your flight?

138
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:44,259
The wedding is at three.

139
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:46,580
Now, it’s your turn!

140
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,990
Think of three things in your life which run
on a timetable.

141
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,100
Make three sentences using the present simple.

142
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,680
Want an extra challenge?

143
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,240
Make questions and answers, like this:

144
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,630
What time does the train leave?

145
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,050
It leaves at five thirty.

146
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,860
Pause the video and make your three sentences
now.

147
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,780
Again, write them down if you want some extra
practice.

148
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,419
Ooh!

149
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,910
We forgot something… a very important question.

150
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,910
Oh?

151
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,670
What’s that?

152
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,630
You don’t remember?

153
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,380
At the beginning: who’s going to win the
next World Cup?

154
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,320
What do you think?

155
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,260
Maybe you said something like:

156
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,130
Italy will win.

157
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:39,110
I hope Russia will win, but I don’t think
they actually will.

158
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,000
England definitely won’t win it.

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,279
To make predictions about the future, you
can use will or won’t.

160
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,559
You can also use going to.

161
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:55,910
You generally use going to for predictions
that are not so far in the future:

162
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,279
It’s going to rain—look at those clouds.

163
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,470
What do you think is going to happen next?

164
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,889
He’s going to be unhappy when he finds out
about this.

165
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:11,540
That said, don’t worry about the difference
between will and going to here.

166
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,860
You can use both freely—no one will notice.

167
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,569
You can also use many other phrases to make
predictions.

168
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:21,260
Let’s look:
So, do you think they’ll do it?

169
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,050
Michelle will definitely do it.

170
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,740
There’s no chance Andy is going to finish.

171
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:33,009
He doesn’t look like he can run to the bus
stop, so I can’t believe he’ll run 26

172
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:34,840
miles.

173
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,920
I don’t know.

174
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,290
He’s been training hard.

175
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,540
He’s unlikely to get a fast time, but I’m
pretty sure he’ll do it.

176
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:47,439
Well, anyway, we can agree that Michelle is
sure to be much faster!

177
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:49,300
Yeah, of course.

178
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,800
Do you think she’ll do it in under three
hours?

179
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,990
It’s not likely that she’ll do it that
fast.

180
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,329
Under three hours for a marathon is quick.

181
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:02,508
But, she’s bound to get under four hours.

182
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:04,730
That’s still a good time.

183
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:11,689
There, we were talking about two people running
a marathon, and making predictions about how

184
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:13,310
they would do.

185
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:21,790
Apart from will and going to, did you notice
any other language we used to make predictions

186
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,480
about the future?

187
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,940
Firstly, you can modify will or going to by
adding an adverb, like this:

188
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,029
She’ll definitely do it.

189
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:35,910
There’s no chance he’s going to finish.

190
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,488
I’m pretty sure he’ll do it.

191
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:42,600
In this way, you can show that you’re more
or less sure about your prediction.

192
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,550
You also heard some other phrases you can
use to make predictions in the future:

193
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,040
He’s unlikely to get a fast time.

194
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,099
She’s sure to be much faster.

195
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,199
It’s not likely that she’ll do it that
fast.

196
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:01,560
She’s bound to get under four hours.

197
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,128
Likely has a similar meaning to probable.

198
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:09,249
Be careful, because likely is an adjective,
not an adverb.

199
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:16,600
So, if you say He’s unlikely to get a fast
time, you mean that he’ll probably be quite

200
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
slow.

201
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,800
Sure to and bound to both mean that you’re
absolutely certain about something.

202
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,979
You can use them to emphasise how sure you
are.

203
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,760
These phrases are a little less common.

204
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,180
However, they are good to know, so you can
add variety to your spoken English.

205
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:40,609
Let’s see how you could use these phrases
in some other ways:

206
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,629
They’re unlikely to hire you if you have
so little experience.

207
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:48,769
It’s exactly your kind of film—you’re
sure to like it.

208
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:51,899
It’s not likely that I’ll wake up before
nine.

209
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:57,529
He’s a really good cook; whatever he makes,
it’s bound to be delicious.

210
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:02,619
Note also that likely can be used with both
a positive and a negative meaning.

211
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:07,860
You can say It’s unlikely that… or He’s
not likely to…

212
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,420
However, sure to and bound to are always positive.

213
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,439
Now, it’s your turn!

214
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,989
Pause the video and make four predictions
about the future.

215
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:23,600
You could make predictions about the weather,
sport, your life, or anything you like!

216
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,520
Make four sentences, say them aloud, and write
them down if you want extra practice.

217
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,840
Done?

218
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,600
Next, let’s look at one more topic you need
to talk about the future.

219
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,299
Up to now, you’ve learned how to talk about
things in the future that you are certain

220
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:45,709
about.

221
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:49,780
However, the future is often uncertain.

222
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,060
How can you express this when you speak English?

223
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,099
Let’s look:
So, do you have any idea when you’ll have

224
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,920
finished everything?

225
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,319
It really depends.

226
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,249
It may be ready next week if everything goes
well.

227
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:08,230
We really need it done sooner.

228
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:14,040
The thing is, it’s possible that we’ll
have to replace some of the artwork.

229
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,639
That could take a few days.

230
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,670
Ok, I have to ask: why are you making such
big changes so late?

231
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,809
For a project like this, those details should
be finalised by now.

232
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:31,170
We had some issues, but anyway, let’s focus
on what we can do now.

233
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,979
Perhaps we won’t need to change anything.

234
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:39,639
In that case, it’ll definitely be finished
by the end of next week.

235
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,230
Even that’s too late.

236
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,529
Look, you need to sort this out.

237
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:47,290
Maybe I’ll work overtime this weekend.

238
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,179
That might help.

239
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,199
Just do what you have to.

240
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:57,329
In this dialogue, I was an employee, and I
wasn’t very sure about a lot of things.

241
00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:03,479
I used different words and phrases to show
that I wasn’t sure.

242
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,929
Do you remember any of them?

243
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:12,110
You can use a modal verb like may, might or
could.

244
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,600
For example:

245
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,809
It may be ready next week.

246
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:17,910
That could take a few days.

247
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,009
That might help.

248
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:24,519
You can also use will with an adverb like
perhaps or maybe.

249
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,220
This has the same meaning as using verbs like
might or could.

250
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,149
For example:

251
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:32,239
Perhaps we won’t need to change anything.

252
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:35,889
Maybe I’ll work overtime this weekend.

253
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:40,959
Finally, you can use the phrase it’s possible
that…, like this:

254
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,599
It’s possible that we’ll have to replace
some of the artwork.

255
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,899
As with all of these sentences, you can change
them to express your own ideas.

256
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:51,899
For example:

257
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,109
I may be away next week.

258
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:56,800
Taking a warm coat might be a good idea.

259
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,099
Perhaps I’ll go to the park for a walk this
afternoon.

260
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,569
It’s possible that she didn’t see your
message.

261
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:12,420
Now, you hopefully understand many different
ways to talk about the future in English.

262
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,589
