00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,580
Hi, I’m Gina.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,479
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:12,040
In this lesson, you can learn how to tell
a story in English.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,099
Stories are powerful.

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,330
When you meet someone new, go to a job interview
or take a speaking exam like IELTS, you need

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,049
to tell stories, whether you realise that’s
what you’re doing or not.

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,530
Becoming a better storyteller will make you
a more convincing speaker.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:34,950
People are attracted to good stories—it’s
a fundamental part of being human.

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,510
Learning how to tell better stories can help
you become a more effective English speaker,

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,890
and a better communicator generally.

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,910
In this class, you’ll learn how to build
a story, step by step.

12
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,489
You’ll see three different stories, and
you’ll see how you can use the same simple

13
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:58,328
ideas in almost any story.

14
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:02,920
If you want to read the stories before the
lesson, make sure you’re watching this on

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,939
our website: Oxford Online English dot com.

16
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:13,100
If you’re watching on YouTube, you can find
a link in the video description.

17
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,939
There, you can read the three stories in full.

18
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,148
We want you to take part in this lesson.

19
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:23,529
Think of a story you want to tell.

20
00:01:23,529 --> 00:01:29,779
As you go through the lesson, you’ll hear
our stories, but you should also be building

21
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:31,908
your own story.

22
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:42,039
So, think of something funny, scary, interesting
or weird that happened to you.

23
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:44,999
Do you have an idea for a story?

24
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:48,060
Then let’s begin!

25
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,210
A clear story needs to start with some background.

26
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:59,428
Think about basic wh- questions: who, when,
where, what?

27
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:04,989
Start your story with one sentence which gives
some of this information.

28
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:07,359
For example:

29
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:12,189
It was summer, and I went with some friends
to a beach in Crimea which you could only

30
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:14,730
get to by boat.

31
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,130
I was travelling in Kyrgyzstan, and I decided
to go hiking in the mountains.

32
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:25,200
At university, I shared a flat with three
other guys.

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,260
Keep it simple at the beginning: who, when,
where, what?

34
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,480
Next, add one or two more sentences to give
more background details.

35
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,250
You need a balance here: you want to give
enough background details to make your story

36
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:50,239
feel real, but you also need to get to the
heart of your story quickly.

37
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,840
People will lose interest if you don’t get
to the point.

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,019
Let’s see how you can do this.

39
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:00,370
Look at our first example:

40
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,799
It was summer, and I went with some friends
to a beach in Crimea which you could only

41
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:08,060
get to by boat.

42
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:15,700
Think: if you heard this, what questions could
you ask to get more details?

43
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,458
You might ask things like:

44
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,599
Who were your friends?

45
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,349
Why did you go to this beach?

46
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:23,738
What was the place like?

47
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:26,349
Were there any other people there?

48
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:33,869
Answering these questions gives you details
you can add after your opening sentence.

49
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,400
For example:

50
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,230
People had been going there for years, and
there were benches and tables, places to camp,

51
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,310
fire places and so on.

52
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,790
It was kind of a hippy place, with everyone
walking around naked and doing whatever they

53
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,420
felt like.

54
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:56,309
Here, we’re focusing on one thing—the
place—because it’s the most interesting

55
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,670
and unusual detail.

56
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,420
For a different story, you might focus on
different details:

57
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:10,600
We were all good friends, but like lots of guys in that situation, we played a lot of pranks on each other.

58
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:17,700
In this story, the people are more important,
so you would give more details about them.

59
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,738
Okay: your turn!

60
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,869
You need to start your story.

61
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,889
Make an opening sentence.

62
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,949
Remember: who, when, where, what?

63
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:35,150
Then, add 1-2 sentences giving more background
details.

64
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,109
Focus on the most important elements in your
story.

65
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,430
Pause the video and do it now!

66
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,480
Write it down if you want.

67
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,980
What’s next?

68
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:59,220
Big question: what makes a story a story?

69
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:06,520
If I tell you that I went to the shop to buy
some bread, and then I came home and ate the

70
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,830
bread, is that a story?

71
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,830
Not really.

72
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,250
If it is, it’s not a good one.

73
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:19,980
So, think about it: what makes a story a story?

74
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,729
A story needs two things.

75
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:26,039
One: there needs to be a goal.

76
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:30,550
The person or people in the story should want
something.

77
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,700
Two: there needs to be tension.

78
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,360
That means the goal can’t be too easy to
reach.

79
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:44,569
In this section, let’s look at putting a
goal in your story.

80
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:50,660
Here’s the question: what do the people
in your story want?

81
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,460
They must want something.

82
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,698
This is the heart of your story.

83
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:01,699
If the people in your story don’t want anything,
then you don’t have a story.

84
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:08,690
Let’s do an example together:
On the last day, we had to catch a train in

85
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,169
the evening.

86
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,659
Pause the video if you need extra time to
read.

87
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:26,760
Here we have a simple goal: we needed to catch
our train.

88
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:33,099
Let’s do one more:
To reach Issyk-Kul lake, which was the end

89
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:39,760
of my journey, I had to cross a mountain pass,
almost 4,000m high.

90
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,849
What’s the goal here?

91
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:46,110
The goal is getting across the mountain pass
to the lake.

92
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:52,030
The goal in your story can be something big
or something small.

93
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:58,219
You can see in these two examples that we
have something very easy and simple—catching

94
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:08,669
a train—and something bigger and more difficult—crossing
a 4,000-metre mountain pass on foot.

95
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:10,139
What about your story?

96
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,139
What’s the goal?

97
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,190
What do the people in your story want?

98
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,490
Keep this simple.

99
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:22,660
Just add one sentence to your story, setting
a goal for you or the other people in your

100
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,990
story.

101
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:29,920
Pause the video, write your sentence, then
we’ll move on to the next part.

102
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,300
Ready?

103
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:37,940
Ok, remember that we said there are two things
every story needs.

104
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:43,099
What’s the second?

105
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:46,438
Every story needs tension.

106
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,400
What does that mean?

107
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,068
Simply, it means that your goal shouldn’t
be too easy to reach.

108
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:56,039
Here’s a story:

109
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,090
There was a monster which liked to eat people.

110
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,659
A hero killed the monster.

111
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:03,659
Everyone was safe.

112
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:04,889
The end.

113
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:06,550
Good story?

114
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,210
Obviously not!

115
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:14,030
If the goal in your story is too easy, then
your story will be very short and boring.

116
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,299
There needs to be tension.

117
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,990
As they listen to you, people should be thinking:
what’s going to happen next?

118
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,000
Will everything be ok?

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,919
How are they going to get out of this problem?

120
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:29,370
The goal needs to be difficult.

121
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,849
There need to be problems.

122
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:36,580
People need to doubt whether you’re going
to succeed or fail.

123
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,320
This is tension.

124
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,520
For example:
On the third day, I had to cross a mountain

125
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,319
pass, almost 4,000m high.

126
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,600
It was so hard, because the air is thin up
there and I was carrying a very heavy pack.

127
00:08:52,600 --> 00:09:00,040
It seemed to take forever, but finally I got
close to the top… and then a storm boiled

128
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,439
over the ridge and landed right on my head.

129
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,720
There was lightning all around me, even below
me!

130
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,920
The noise was unbelievable.

131
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,660
First, you hear how difficult it was, even
before the storm hit.

132
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,030
Then, the storm arrives.

133
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,329
What’s going to happen?

134
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,280
Did I make it over the pass?

135
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,540
Did I get hurt?

136
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,819
Let’s look at one more example:
One weekend, I was going home to visit my

137
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,820
parents.

138
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:39,240
I said bye to my flatmates, and told them
not to do anything to my room.

139
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,710
“Don’t worry, we won’t.

140
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,180
Have a good weekend,” they said.

141
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:52,800
I knew they were going to do something, but
I couldn’t believe what they actually did:

142
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,250
This is a very different kind of story, but
the structure is the same.

143
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:03,780
I have a goal, which is to visit my parents
and come back without my friends doing anything

144
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,949
to my room.

145
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,190
You also have some tension.

146
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,230
You hear sentences like this:

147
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,890
I told them not to do anything to my room.

148
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,069
I knew they were going to do something.

149
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:24,570
When you hear these, you know they’re going
to do something to my room, but you don’t

150
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,840
know what.

151
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,170
This is called foreshadowing.

152
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:33,500
You know something bad is going to happen,
but you aren’t sure exactly what.

153
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,280
That’s where the tension comes from.

154
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,130
What did they actually do?

155
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,840
Hopefully, you want to know what happened
next.

156
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,570
Now, think about your story.

157
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,400
How can you add some tension?

158
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:53,970
One way is to add problems or difficulties:
things that get between you and your goal.

159
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,980
Another way is to use foreshadowing, like
our story above.

160
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,390
Pause the video and add tension to your story.

161
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:08,040
This is an important part of your story, so
think about it carefully.

162
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:15,839
Aim to write 2-3 sentences, and start again
when you’re done.

163
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,120
Okay?

164
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:24,580
Now, you’re ready to think about the end
of your story.

165
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,110
To finish your story, you need to resolve
the tension.

166
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,900
At this point, the people listening to your
story should want to know what comes next.

167
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,680
You’ve created some tension.

168
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,099
They aren’t sure what’s going to happen,
but they want to know.

169
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:49,390
So, finishing your story is simple: explain
what happened in the end, and whether you

170
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,819
(or whoever) reached your goal or not.

171
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:58,640
Let’s finish the three stories you’ve
seen in this lesson:

172
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,240
Remember that you can pause if you need more
time to read or review the story.

173
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,260
Let’s read the end together.

174
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:13,140
We loaded our stuff onto a kayak and swam
almost a kilometre around the cliffs.

175
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:19,170
A naked hippy paddled the kayak, which was
piled high with our things and looked like

176
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,920
it could sink at any minute.

177
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:29,329
We made it to land, and after several hours
of hitchhiking and walking, we caught our

178
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,750
train.

179
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:37,920
It was stressful at the time, but looking
back now it makes a good story!

180
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,660
You can see that the ending does two things.

181
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:47,469
In this story, we have tension: there’s
a mine in the harbour and we can’t leave

182
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,120
by boat.

183
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,870
How did we solve it?

184
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:57,480
By swimming for a kilometre, with a naked
hippy transporting our stuff in an overloaded

185
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,740
kayak.

186
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:06,430
Secondly, the ending explains whether we reached
our goal or not.

187
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:11,270
In this case, happily, we caught the train!

188
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,939
What about our second story?

189
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:19,430
I forgot how tired I was and ran down the
slopes to get to safety.

190
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,479
I stayed the night lower down and tried again
the next day.

191
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,710
I made it over the pass, but it was a very
frightening experience.

192
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:36,630
Again, the ending resolves the tension—I
ran below the storm and tried again the next

193
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:42,580
day—and also explains whether I reached
my goal or not.

194
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,920
Finally, what did happen to my room at university?

195
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,740
They made my room into a jungle!

196
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:55,200
I’m not kidding: there were flowers, plants,
three whole trees, jungle animals made from

197
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,710
paper, and a ‘sounds of the forest’ mix
playing on my stereo.

198
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:07,290
It took me three hours to clean up, and also
I have hay fever—an allergy to pollen—so

199
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,120
I was sneezing and blowing my nose the whole
time.

200
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,240
For my flatmates, that just made it funnier…

201
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:19,880
It’s the same pattern: we resolve the tension
by answering the question: what did my flatmates

202
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,220
do to my room?

203
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:28,420
We also find out whether I reached my goal
or not (I didn’t).

204
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:35,160
Now you’ve seen the three stories; can you
see what each one has right at the end?

205
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,730
Each story ends with a retrospective comment.

206
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,210
Retrospective means ‘looking back’.

207
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:49,070
A retrospective comment tells people how you
feel now about the story, or how other people

208
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,840
felt.

209
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,150
For example:

210
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:59,360
It was stressful at the time, but looking
back now it makes a good story!

211
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,130
It was a very frightening experience.

212
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,830
For my flatmates, that just made it funnier…

213
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:11,580
You don’t have to put a retrospective comment
at the end of your story, but it’s a good

214
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,580
way to finish.

215
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,770
Most of all, a retrospective comment sounds
like an ending.

216
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:24,360
That’s useful, especially if you’re speaking,
because it shows your listener that you’ve

217
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,330
finished speaking.

218
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,300
Now, you need to finish your story.

219
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,469
Pause the video and write an ending.

220
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:39,630
Remember that you need to do two things: resolve
the tension, and explain whether or not you

221
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:43,340
reached your goals.

222
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:48,220
Let’s review: to tell a good story, you
need to:

223
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,570
- Set the scene and give some background information.

224
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:58,460
- Establish a goal for the person or people
in your story.

225
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:04,680
- Add some tension, so that people aren’t
sure what will happen in the end.

226
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:09,230
- Finish the story and add a retrospective
comment.

227
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,620
Of course, there are other things which are
important in a story.

228
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:19,760
Adding interesting details and descriptions
can make your story more lifelike.

229
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,510
Adding jokes and humour can improve many stories.

230
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:30,569
Giving some background on the people and their
personalities can bring the people in your

231
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,970
stories to life.

232
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:39,510
But, nothing is more important than structure,
and that’s what you’ve seen in this lesson.

233
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:44,430
A story without good structure isn’t really
a story.

234
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,760
Get the structure right first.

235
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,760
Maybe you’re thinking, “I don’t have
the vocabulary to tell stories like that.”

236
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:59,000
Not true: I’ve heard very powerful stories
from students who spoke very basic English.

237
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,550
Vocabulary doesn’t make a good story.

238
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,879
Structure and emotion make a good story.

239
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,439
Focus on structure and practise what you’ve
learned in this lesson.

240
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,760
You can tell great stories in English, too!

241
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,990
Do you have a story you’d like to share?

242
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,740
Please post it in the comments.

243
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:24,419
You can see the sample stories we used in
this lesson in the full lesson on our website:

We also have many other free English lessons
which you can watch and study from.

246
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,820
That’s all for this lesson.

247
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,668
