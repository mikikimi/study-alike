00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,279
Hello, I'm Oli. Welcome to Oxford Online English!
In this lesson, you can learn about how to

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:14,820
talk about your home in English. Where do
you live? What's your home like? What about

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,270
your neighbourhood? Talking about where you
live is a common conversation topic in English.

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:26,460
So it's good to have some things to say. Part
one: introducing where you live and talking

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:36,059
about types of home. Let's start with a simple
sentence. "I live in a..." what could you

6
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:43,919
put there? You could say, "I live in a house,"
"I live in an apartment." In Britain, people

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,159
sometimes say, "Flat." 'Flat' and 'apartment'
have the same meaning.

8
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:56,769
Next, let's add a bit more detail. What kind
of house or apartment is it? For example,

9
00:00:56,769 --> 00:01:04,069
"I live in a small, two-stoery house in the
suburbs." When we say how many floors a building

10
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:10,639
has, we usually use the word storey, so you
can say a two-storey house, a four-storey

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,560
apartment building and so on. "I live in an
apartment on the third floor of a four-storey

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,640
building." There are many different kinds
of house and apartment. For example, do you

13
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,700
live in a terraced house, a semi-detached
house, or a detached house? Terraced houses

14
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,929
have other houses on both sides, a semi-detached
house has another house just on one side,

15
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:45,439
and a detached house stands by itself. Detached
houses are usually larger and more expensive.

16
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,460
Terraced houses are usually smaller and cheaper.

17
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:56,009
What kinds of houses are more common in your
country? What about apartments? Many apartments

18
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:03,119
are in apartment buildings. Easy enough, right?
If you live in a very tall apartment building

19
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:10,878
with many floors, you can say you live in
a high-rise in American English or a tower

20
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:17,679
block in British English. Sometimes a house
is divided into apartments, these are called

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,629
converted apartments. Apartments come in many
different sizes, if an apartment just has

22
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:31,310
one room which is a bedroom and living room
together, it's called a studio. Of course,

23
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:37,239
you can also have bigger apartments, a two-bedroom
apartment, a three-bedroom apartment and so

24
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:45,280
on. Large apartments might be duplex apartments,
this means the apartment has more than one

25
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,110
floor.

26
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,980
What about you? Where do you live? Do you
live in a house or an apartment? Could you

27
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:59,439
make a sentence using the vocabulary from
this section? For example, "I live in a two-story

28
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:07,090
terraced house." "I live in an apartment on
the 28th floor of a high-rise building." "I

29
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:14,170
live in a converted studio apartment." Next,
let's see how you can describe the inside

30
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:20,328
of your home in more detail. If you want to
describe your home, what can you talk about?

31
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:27,319
Well, you could start by saying what rooms
it has. For example, "My house has two bedrooms,

32
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:33,700
a kitchen, a living room, and a garden." It's
always better to add adjectives or details

33
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:40,399
to make your speaking more interesting. Let's
try: "My house has two small bedrooms, a kitchen

34
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,700
with a dining table, a living room with big
windows, and a small garden."

35
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,780
What other rooms might you have in your home?
You could have a dining room for people to

36
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:58,469
eat together. Maybe you have an office or
a study where you can work, if you live in

37
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:04,489
a warmer country, you might have a balcony
or a terrace where you can sit outside in

38
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:10,950
warmer weather. What about your home? What
does it have? Does your home have a garden,

39
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:17,738
a balcony, or another outdoor area? Try to
make a sentence describing your home. For

40
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:23,510
example, "I live in a two-bedroom apartment.
The bedrooms are quite small, but there's

41
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,659
a big living room with a dining area, a modern
kitchen, and also a small balcony where we

42
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,680
can sit outside in the summer." What can you
say about your home?

43
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,650
Okay, next, saying what you like or dislike.
So now you can hopefully describe your home

44
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:46,169
a little bit, but what about your opinion?
What do you like about your home, and what

45
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:52,470
would you change if you could? Positive words
you could use to describe your home include

46
00:04:52,470 --> 00:05:01,620
'spacious', meaning large with lots of room;
'cosy' which means comfortable in a warm welcoming

47
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:09,560
way; 'light' describes a home which gets lot
of natural light. You can say your home is

48
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:16,920
'warm' or 'cool', meaning that it's comfortable
in winter or in summer. Finally, you can describe

49
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,580
your home as 'convenient', meaning it's close
to your job, it's close to the shops, it's

50
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:30,580
close to your children's school and so on.
You can use 'convenient' plus 'for.' For example,

51
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:37,250
"it's convenient for the subway," or "it's
convenient for my office." Could you use any

52
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,010
of these words to describe your home?

53
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:47,090
Okay, but what if you don't like your home?
Well, here are some words you could use: 'cramped'

54
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:53,419
means your home is too small, so you don't
have enough space. 'Dark' means your home

55
00:05:53,420 --> 00:06:00,670
doesn't get enough light, so that even when
it's sunny outside, it's still dark inside.

56
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:07,950
'Drafty' means cold air comes inside through
the windows or through the doors in the winter.

57
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:14,780
'Stuffy' means there's not enough air so it's
very uncomfortable in hot weather. You could

58
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:20,130
say your home is 'noisy', for example if you
live near a main road, your home might be

59
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,760
noisy even at night.

60
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:28,430
Can you make a sentence about your home using
some of these words? For example, "My home

61
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:35,070
is light and spacious, but it can get very
drafty in the winter." "I like my apartment

62
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,849
because it's cosy, although it can be noisy
because there's a restaurant just downstairs."

63
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:45,970
Okay, so now you can talk about your home
and what you think of it. What else can you

64
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:52,170
say on this topic? Let's look, part four:
saying who you live with. Who do you live

65
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:59,090
with? Do live with your parents, your husband
or wife, with your family? Do you live by

66
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:06,900
yourself or do you live with flatmates (people
who you share a rented flat with)? Maybe you

67
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,179
live with friends.

68
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:16,100
Let's look at examples of what you could say
here. "I live with my parents." "I live in

69
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:24,830
a shared house; I have four flatmates." "I
live by myself." What about you? Okay, that

70
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:30,810
was easy. Let's look at one more topic you
can talk about. Part five: talking about your

71
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:37,490
neighbourhood. First, be careful with the
word 'neighbourhood'. A neighbourhood is not

72
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:45,660
a person; it's the area near your home. So
where is your home? Is it in the city centre,

73
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:53,010
the suburbs, or outside the city? If you live
outside the city, do you live on the outskirts

74
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:58,330
of the city, in a village, or in the middle
of nowhere?

75
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:05,090
How could you describe your neighbourhood?
Is it quiet or lively? Trendy or boring? Are

76
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:11,820
there many shops, cafes, bars, restaurants?
Are there parks or sports facilities? For

77
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:18,620
example, you could say, "I live in a very
lively area just south of the city center.

78
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:26,280
There are many cafes, shops, and places to
go." Or, "I live in a quiet area in the suburbs,

79
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,640
in the north of the city. It's a nice area
and it's quiet, but it's a bit boring. There

80
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:39,068
isn't really anything to do." What about you?
Can you say something about your neighborhood?

81
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:45,089
Okay, finally let's put everything together.
If you can use everything we've looked at

82
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:51,319
in this lesson, you should be able to speak
very clearly and with lots of details about

83
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:54,209
your home and where you live.

84
00:08:54,209 --> 00:09:00,359
For example, "I live in a two-story terraced
house. It has two bedrooms, a living room,

85
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,399
a small kitchen, and a garden. It's cosy and
convenient for getting to work, but it's a

86
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:13,019
bit cramped, especially when we have guests.
I live with my wife and daughter. Our house

87
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:18,600
is near the city centre in a quiet neighborhood.
There isn't much to do, but there are some

88
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,540
small shops and a park where we go if the
weather's nice."

89
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:30,560
Here's one more sample answer: "I live by
myself in a studio apartment. It just has

90
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,529
one main room with a tiny kitchen. It's very
warm in winter, but it can get a bit stuffy

91
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:42,930
in summer. I live in the city center, very
close to everything. It's very lively, with

92
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,849
lots of bars and restaurants. It's a good
place for young people to live, but not many

93
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,720
families choose to live here."

94
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,660
What about you? Can you make an answer like
this talking about where you live? Try to

95
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,230
use as much language from the lesson as you
can. Okay, that's the end of the lesson. Thanks

96
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:07,480
very much for watching. You can see more of
our free English lessons on our website, oxfordonlineenglish.com,

97
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,639
but that's all. Thanks again. I'll see you
next time. Bye-bye!
