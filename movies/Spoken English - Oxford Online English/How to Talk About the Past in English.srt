00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,420
Hi, I’m Martin.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,760
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,338
In this lesson, you can learn how to talk
about the past in English.

4
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:17,250
Talking about the past includes many things.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,300
Do you want to talk about interesting experiences
you’ve had, tell a funny story, or talk

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,480
about something you regret in the past?

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,230
In this lesson, you’ll see the words, phrases
and structures you need to talk about the

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,170
past in clear, fluent English.

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:44,370
Let’s start by seeing how you can talk about
your experiences in the past.

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,989
Have you ever been bungee jumping?

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,470
No, I haven’t.

12
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,449
I’ve been skydiving, though.

13
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,940
What about you?

14
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,849
Have you ever done any extreme sports like
that?

15
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,940
Does windsurfing count?

16
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,820
I’ve tried windsurfing, although that was
a long time ago.

17
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,250
I think windsurfing definitely counts!

18
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,880
I’ve seen people doing it and they were
going at crazy speeds.

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,860
I’ve never done anything like that myself.

20
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,280
Skydiving sounds very extreme to me.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,540
Where did you do it?

22
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,740
It was in Spain.

23
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,539
I did a tandem jump.

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,690
It was fun, but I’m not sure I’d do it
again.

25
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,530
You probably know already that English has
different past verb forms to talk about the

26
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,490
past in different ways.

27
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,699
However, you often need a present verb form
to talk about the past.

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,170
You saw an example in the dialogue you just
heard.

29
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:43,080
Use the present perfect to talk or ask about
experiences in the past, but only if you don’t

30
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,548
say a time!

31
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:45,549
For example:

32
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:47,540
I’ve tried windsurfing.

33
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,630
I’ve never been bungee jumping.

34
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,630
Have you ever been skydiving?

35
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,990
Of course, you can change these to talk about
different things, like this:

36
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,030
I’ve read ‘The Idiot’.

37
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,280
I’ve never drunk whisky.

38
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,810
Have you ever grown your own vegetables?

39
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:20,230
However, as soon as you mention a time, you
need to switch to a past tense.

40
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,329
For example:

41
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,400
I went windsurfing three years ago.

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,909
I didn’t drink a lot last year.

43
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:34,849
Did you eat a lot of sushi when you were in
Japan?

44
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:39,299
For this reason, when you’re talking about
life experiences, you often start with the

45
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:46,129
present perfect, and then switch to the past
tense when you mention a specific time.

46
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:51,170
For example, someone might ask you, Have you
ever been to Australia?

47
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:57,220
You might answer, Yes, I went there two years
ago, for my friend’s wedding.

48
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:02,980
The question is present perfect, because it’s
asking about experiences without mentioning

49
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,268
a time.

50
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:11,219
The answer mentions a time—two years ago—and
so you need the past simple.

51
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:21,160
Next, let’s see how you can talk about differences
between the past and the present.

52
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,260
Wow!

53
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,799
You used to have a beard?

54
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,189
You look so different!

55
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:26,189
Yeah!

56
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:29,290
That was during my punk rock phase.

57
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,290
Really?

58
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,809
Did you use to be in a band or something?

59
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:37,590
Yes, but it wasn’t anything big.

60
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:43,069
There were a few of us who were all mates,
and we would play in pubs or small clubs.

61
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:45,249
So, what were you?

62
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:46,549
Singer?

63
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:47,840
Guitar?

64
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,140
Drummer!

65
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,260
I used to play the drums.

66
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,260
And now?

67
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,399
You don’t play any more?

68
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,760
No, I gave up.

69
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,480
In English, there are past structures which
you can use to show a difference between the

70
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,939
past and the present.

71
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:10,019
Can you remember any of these from the dialogue?

72
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:16,870
You can use used to to talk about something
which was true in the past, but isn’t true

73
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,260
now.

74
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,260
For example:

75
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,680
He used to have a beard.

76
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,569
--> He had a beard in the past, but he doesn’t
have one now.

77
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:30,270
I used to live in Berlin.

78
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,919
--> I lived in Berlin in the past, but I don’t
live there now.

79
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,650
You can also use the negative form—didn’t
use to—to talk about things that weren’t

80
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,400
true in the past, but are true now.

81
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
For example:

82
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,840
They didn’t use to get on so well.

83
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,429
--> They didn’t get on well in the past,
but they do now.

84
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,029
I didn’t use to wear glasses.

85
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:57,210
--> I wear glasses now, but I didn’t in
the past.

86
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,560
You can also make questions:

87
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,970
Did you use to play a musical instrument?

88
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,830
Didn’t he use to work here?

89
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:14,180
You can also use would to talk about actions
or habits which you did in the past, but you

90
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,560
don’t do now.

91
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,520
For example:

92
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:25,609
When we got home, Mum would make us beans
on toast and then we’d watch cartoons.

93
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:31,939
There was this bakery near the office where
I would go every lunchtime to get a sandwich

94
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:34,979
and chat to the other regulars.

95
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:39,449
Finally, you can also use a present verb plus
any more.

96
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,470
This has a similar meaning to used to.

97
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,009
Let’s look:

98
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,569
She doesn’t live here any more.

99
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:49,879
--> She lived here in the past, but she doesn’t
live here now.

100
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,240
I don’t have time to listen to music any
more.

101
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,319
--> I had time in the past, but now I don’t.

102
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,770
What about you?

103
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,299
How is your life different now?

104
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:10,150
Let’s practice: pause the video and make
three sentences about how your life is different

105
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,799
to the past.

106
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:19,349
Try to use all of the language from this section:
used to, would and any more.

107
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:24,280
You can say your sentences out loud, or write
them down.

108
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,460
Pause the video and do it now!

109
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:38,640
In the next two sections, you’re going to
see useful language for telling a story.

110
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,969
Oh!

111
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,130
Have I told you what happened to us on our
trip?

112
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,130
No!

113
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,130
What happened?

114
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,819
It’s a really crazy story.

115
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:52,069
So, we were sitting on the bus, ready to leave…

116
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:54,080
Where were you going?

117
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,680
Sofia.

118
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,960
Anyway, the weather was awful.

119
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,909
It was raining so hard you couldn’t even
see out of the window, and…

120
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,080
Who were you travelling with?

121
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,969
With my wife.

122
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,229
We were planning to visit some old friends
who…

123
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,979
Where was the bus leaving from?

124
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:14,199
From Athens.

125
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,700
Look, can I tell my story, or not?

126
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,880
Oh, sorry…

127
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:23,750
When you tell a story, you need to set the
scene.

128
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,590
What does ‘set the scene’ mean?

129
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,378
It means you need to describe the background
of the story.

130
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:32,530
What was happening at the start of the story?

131
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:38,719
Who was there, and what were the people in
your story doing at the start?

132
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:44,998
To give background to a story, you use the
past continuous.

133
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:46,930
For example:

134
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,530
We were sitting on the bus, ready to leave.

135
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:57,960
It was raining so hard you couldn’t even
see out of the window.

136
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,849
If you’re telling a story from your own
life, you’ll often start with one or two

137
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:07,849
sentences in the past continuous to set the
scene.

138
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:09,539
You might say:

139
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,190
I was living in a small apartment at the time.

140
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,849
I was driving home after work.

141
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:22,270
This isn’t just useful when you’re telling
long stories; you can use this any time you’re

142
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:28,270
giving a slightly longer answer about the
past, for example in a job interview or an

143
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,889
IELTS exam.

144
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:34,560
However, if you do want to tell a longer story,
there are some other things you’ll need

145
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,439
to know.

146
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,800
Did I tell you about my driving test?

147
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,569
No, what happened?

148
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,030
I passed!

149
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,120
You know, I took it last week, and I hadn’t
taken any lessons.

150
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,170
Not one!

151
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,640
No way!

152
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,510
But, you must have practiced at least?

153
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,510
No!

154
00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:00,040
I had only driven a car twice in my life
How on earth did you pass?

155
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,510
It was rush hour.

156
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:05,640
We drove out of the test centre, and then
we sat in a traffic jam.

157
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,900
All of the streets were totally stuck.

158
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,010
I made three left turns, and finally we arrived
back at the test centre.

159
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,140
I just drove around the block once!

160
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,650
And that counts as a pass?

161
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,220
Hey, I didn’t make any mistakes.

162
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,010
So what happened next?

163
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,040
Did you drive home?

164
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,569
Well…

165
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,600
What happened?

166
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,050
I tried, and I had a very small accident.

167
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:34,180
I mean, I don’t think it even counts as
an accident.

168
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,959
Maybe you should take some driving lessons.

169
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,980
Very funny.

170
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,590
When you start a story, you usually say when
these things took place.

171
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:49,340
You’ll say something like:

172
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,730
Last week…

173
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,810
This happened two years ago, in summer.

174
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:59,569
So, yesterday, I was walking down the street…

175
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:06,780
This time reference ‘fixes’ the time when
your story starts.

176
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,220
What does this mean?

177
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,980
Well, think about the story you heard in the
dialogue.

178
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,290
The time reference was ‘last week’.

179
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,339
During the story, I talked about things that
happened before the start of the story, even

180
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,930
further in the past.

181
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,680
I also talked about things that happened in
the story, meaning they happened after the

182
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,810
start of the story.

183
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,709
Do you know how to talk about these two different
ideas?

184
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,820
Do you remember from the dialogue?

185
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:43,250
To talk about things that happened before
the start of the story, use the past perfect:

186
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,890
had done.

187
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,890
For example:

188
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:50,630
I hadn’t taken any driving lessons.

189
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:55,630
I had only driven a car twice in my life.

190
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,990
The story was about taking a driving test.

191
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:06,360
You need to use the past perfect to talk about
things that had happened before the start

192
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,580
of the story.

193
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,950
Let’s see another example:

194
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:17,400
When I was 25, I quit my job and decided to
train as a pilot.

195
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,300
I had always wanted to learn to fly.

196
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:29,240
Here, you have a time reference which ‘fixes’
the start of the story

197
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:37,230
Then, you use the past perfect to talk about
things which happened before that time, further

198
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,120
in the past.

199
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,790
If you’re talking about the events of your
story, just use the past simple, like this:

200
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,969
We drove out of the test centre.

201
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,480
We sat in a traffic jam for ages.

202
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,890
I had a small accident on the way home.

203
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,470
Using these verb tenses, you can make it clear
when things happened in the past, and whether

204
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,760
something happened before or after something
else.

205
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,830
Do you have a funny story you’d like to
share?

206
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,680
Let us know in the comments!

207
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:17,370
Let’s look at one more topic.

208
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,750
Do you speak any other languages?

209
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,750
Not really.

210
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,790
I used to speak Spanish, but I haven’t used
it for years.

211
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,750
I wish I’d started learning other languages
when I was younger.

212
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,880
It’s so much easier if you start earlier.

213
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,230
Yeah, I know what you mean.

214
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,050
If only I’d kept my Spanish going…

215
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,170
Why don’t you pick it up again?

216
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,719
It’d come back.

217
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,700
Maybe…

218
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,040
You know what, though?

219
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,699
I wish I’d spent some time in Latin America
when I had the chance.

220
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,250
I could have lived there for a year or two,
and my Spanish would have got really good.

221
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:54,750
Well, you could still do it, right?

222
00:12:54,750 --> 00:13:03,990
In the dialogue, you saw three different forms
you can use to talk about regrets in the past.

223
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,190
Do you remember them?

224
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:14,040
First, you can use wish plus the past perfect
to talk about something you regret.

225
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,920
For example:

226
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,000
I wish I’d learned other languages when
I was younger.

227
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,240
I wish I hadn’t said that.

228
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:32,060
Remember that here you’re talking about
the opposite of what really happened.

229
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:39,330
If you say I wish I hadn’t said that, you
did say something in reality, and now you

230
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,120
regret it.

231
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,220
You can also use if only plus the past perfect,
like this:

232
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,180
If only I’d kept my Spanish going.

233
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,120
If only I hadn’t wasted so much time.

234
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,320
The meaning is very similar to wish: you did
something, or didn’t do something, in the

235
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,780
past, and now you regret it.

236
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:09,030
Finally, you can sometimes use could have
to express regrets in the past, often as part

237
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,540
of a longer if-sentence.

238
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,599
For example:

239
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,450
I could have tried harder.

240
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:24,140
If I hadn’t left things to the last minute,
I could have passed easily.

241
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,800
Let’s do one more practice.

242
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,240
Think of three regrets that you have.

243
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,490
Make three sentences using the language from
this section.

244
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:39,470
Try to use all three forms: wish, if only
and could have.

245
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,110
Pause the video, and make your sentences now!

246
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:47,160
You can say them aloud, or write them down.

247
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,280
Done?

248
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,920
Great!

249
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:56,979
Now, you’ve learned many different ways
to talk about the past in English.

250
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:02,340
Which English past form do you find the most
difficult to use?

251
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:08,130
Let us know in the comments, and maybe you’ll
get some useful tips!
