00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,088
Hi, I’m Kae.

2
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:09,700
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,809
In this lesson, you can learn about sentence
stress in English.

4
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:17,359
Stress is very important for your English
pronunciation.

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,030
There are many different types of stress in
English, and stress is used in many different

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,190
ways.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,480
But wait a minute, what is stress?

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,220
Stress means that you pronounce some syllables
more strongly than others.

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:36,440
‘More strongly’ means you pronounce these
syllables more loudly, more clearly, and more

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,390
slowly.

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,160
Pronouncing sentence stress correctly will
make a big difference to your English pronunciation.

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,169
You’ll immediately sound clearer and more
natural when you speak English.

13
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:55,440
Let’s start by looking at sentence stress
in more detail.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,640
Look at a sentence:

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,829
How about we go for a coffee this afternoon?

16
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,789
In this sentence, there are two kinds of words;
let’s call them content words and grammar

17
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:10,100
words.

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,860
Content words give you the meaning of the
sentence.

19
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,890
The content words here are go, coffee, this
and afternoon.

20
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,560
If you don’t hear these words, you won’t
understand the sentence.

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,620
Grammar words don’t carry meaning.

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:31,310
They’re grammatically necessary; they connect
the content words together.

23
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:38,509
Think about it this way: if someone comes
up to you and says, “Go coffee this afternoon?”

24
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:43,060
you can understand what they mean, even if
it sounds a bit weird.

25
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,560
So, why are we talking about this?

26
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,350
Aren’t we supposed to be talking about sentence
stress?

27
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:55,039
The difference between content words and grammar
words is the foundation of sentence stress.

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,480
Content words are usually stressed, and grammar
words are usually unstressed.

29
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:07,439
Listen and try to hear the stress: how about
we GO for a COFFEE THIS AFTERNOON?

30
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,239
Listen again: how about we GO for a COFFEE
THIS AFTERNOON?

31
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,060
Can you read the sentence with the stress?

32
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:22,319
Repeat after me: how about we GO for a COFFEE
THIS AFTERNOON?

33
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,480
Do it one more time: how about we GO for a
COFFEE THIS AFTERNOON?

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
Let’s look at one more example sentence:

35
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:35,029
My phone’s broken, so I’m going to buy
a new one.

36
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:40,379
Which words do you think are content words,
and which words are grammar words?

37
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:44,379
Before you answer, you should know one important
point.

38
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:49,929
Sentence stress is flexible, and the line
between content words and grammar words isn’t

39
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:56,590
fixed, so the answers we show you are just
the most probable ones; there are other possibilities.

40
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:03,540
So, think about your sentence, and which words
you think are content words or grammar words.

41
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,920
Pause the video if you want more thinking
time!

42
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,000
Ready?

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,700
Here’s our suggestion.

44
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:15,459
Again, think about it like this: if you hear
the content words, you can understand the

45
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:21,340
meaning of the sentence: “phone broken,
going buy new one.”

46
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:30,000
If you hear only the grammar words, it doesn’t
make any sense at all: “my so I’m to a.”

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,510
By the way, this idea can also really help
your English listening.

48
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,940
You can see that you don’t need to hear
every word to understand the meaning of a

49
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,020
sentence.

50
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,860
If you focus on listening to the stressed
words, you can understand someone’s meaning,

51
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,669
even if you don’t hear the unstressed grammar
words.

52
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:50,079
Anyway, let’s practice this sentence.

53
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,809
Can you say the sentence with the stress?

54
00:03:52,809 --> 00:03:59,440
Repeat after me: my PHONE’S BROKEN, so i’m
GOING to BUY a NEW ONE.

55
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:06,280
Try once more: my PHONE’S BROKEN, so i’m
GOING to BUY a NEW ONE.

56
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,480
Okay, now you know the basics about sentence
stress.

57
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:14,840
Let’s see what you can do!

58
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,410
Look at three sentences:

59
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,860
Could you get some bread from the bakery on
your way here?

60
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,949
I heard that the weather’s going to be bad
tomorrow.

61
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:28,960
He has no idea what he wants to do after he
graduates.

62
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,659
So, first of all, pause the video, and find
the stressed words in these three sentences.

63
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:40,250
Take as much time as you need, and start again
when you’re ready.

64
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,250
Okay?

65
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,460
Let’s look at our suggested answers.

66
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,820
Remember that other answers are possible:

67
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,340
Next, let’s try reading the sentences together.

68
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:57,819
Repeat after me, and pay attention to the
stress: could you GET some BREAD from the

69
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:02,449
BAKERY on your WAY HERE?

70
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:10,220
Try it once more: could you GET some BREAD
from the BAKERY on your WAY HERE?

71
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:19,000
Let’s do the next one: i HEARD that the
WEATHER’S going to be BAD TOMORROW.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,520
One more time: i HEARD that the WEATHER’S
going to be BAD TOMORROW.

73
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:36,200
Let’s try the third sentence: he has NO
IDEA WHAT he WANTS to DO AFTER he GRADUATES.

74
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:44,280
Again: he has NO IDEA WHAT he WANTS to DO
AFTER he GRADUATES.

75
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,539
How was that?

76
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:46,539
Easy?

77
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:47,539
Difficult?

78
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:53,568
Remember that you can go back and review this
section as many times as you need to.

79
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:57,629
You can also adjust the video speed to make
it easier or more difficult.

80
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:02,930
For example, if you find it difficult, watch
this section again at point seven five or

81
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,300
point five speed.

82
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,340
Practice at a lower speed until you can pronounce
the stress easily.

83
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,239
Then, try again at full speed!

84
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,060
Now, to pronounce sentence stress well, you
also need to pay attention to the unstressed

85
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,879
words in a sentence.

86
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,040
Why is this?

87
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,300
Here’s a very important point about sentence
stress, or any stress.

88
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,690
Stress is about contrast.

89
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:36,990
You heard before that stress means pronouncing
some syllables more loudly, more clearly,

90
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,430
and more slowly than others.

91
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,680
That means that stress is relative.

92
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,830
To pronounce stress clearly, you need a clear
contrast between your stressed and unstressed

93
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,139
syllables.

94
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:53,539
So, when you’re practicing sentence stress,
you should pay equal attention to the unstressed

95
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:54,539
words.

96
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:59,300
Let’s look at an example, using a sentence
you saw before:

97
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,639
could you GET some BREAD from the BAKERY on
your WAY HERE?

98
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,879
You need to pronounce the stressed words more
strongly, and you need to pronounce the unstressed

99
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:13,680
words at a lower volume and a higher speed.

100
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,129
Often, unstressed words have a weak pronunciation.

101
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:22,060
Knowing how to pronounce weak forms is also
important if you want to pronounce sentence

102
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,560
stress clearly.

103
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,800
Let’s try something.

104
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,400
Read the sentence.

105
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,599
Make the stressed words as clear as possible.

106
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,439
Exaggerate the stress a little bit.

107
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:37,690
Pronounce the unstressed words as fast as
you can.

108
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:43,180
Try to get a really clear contrast between
the stressed and unstressed words.

109
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:50,440
Listen first: could you GET some BREAD from
the BAKERY on your WAY HERE?

110
00:07:50,440 --> 00:08:00,580
Now you try: could you GET some BREAD from
the BAKERY on your WAY HERE?

111
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,400
Let’s do one more example, with a new sentence.

112
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,320
Look at the sentence:

113
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,050
i HAVEN’T HEARD ANYTHING from them SINCE
their WEDDING.

114
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,740
Try reading the sentence.

115
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:18,449
Again, focus on the contrast between stressed
and unstressed syllalbles: i HAVEN’T HEARD

116
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:24,680
ANYTHING from them SINCE their WEDDING.

117
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,759
It’s worth spending some time practicing
this contrast: if you can pronounce the contrast

118
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,300
between stressed and unstressed sounds clearly,
your English will sound much better and more

119
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,978
natural.

120
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,100
We were exaggerating the contrast slightly,
so that you could hear it clearly.

121
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,430
It’s fine to do this while you’re practicing!

122
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:48,599
You can go back and review this section, or
review the previous section and focus on contrast

123
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,269
in your pronunciation.

124
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:52,360
What’s next?

125
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,810
Well, you heard before that sentence stress
is flexible.

126
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:00,819
Let’s talk more about that!

127
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,050
Hello, what can I get you?

128
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:07,859
One chocolate and raspberry muffin and a small
americano with milk, please.

129
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,580
Sorry, you said a CHOCOLATE and raspberry
muffin?

130
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,839
That’s right!

131
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,120
Here you are!

132
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,699
I said a chocolate RASPBERRY muffin.

133
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,649
Oh, I am sorry!

134
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:23,320
I thought you said chocolate and STRAWBERRY.

135
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,639
Also, is there milk in this coffee?

136
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,290
Did you want MILK?

137
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,860
I thought you said an americano with SUGAR!

138
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,680
No, with MILK!

139
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,670
I’ll make you a new one.

140
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,060
One cappuccino with milk coming up.

141
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,130
No, not CAPPUCINO!

142
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,130
AMERICANO!

143
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,760
Right, right, just a minute.

144
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,399
Sentence stress is flexible.

145
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,600
It doesn’t follow strict rules; instead,
it depends on the meaning you want to express.

146
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,310
Sometimes, one idea in your sentence is more
important than others.

147
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,739
You’ll add extra stress to this idea.

148
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,880
Why does this happen?

149
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,350
One reason is to contradict or correct someone.

150
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,589
For example:

151
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:08,240
Buenos Aires is the capital of China.

152
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,770
No, Mikey.

153
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,040
Buenos Aires is the capital of ARGENTINA.

154
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,670
BEIJING is the capital of China.

155
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,620
Two plus two is five.

156
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,980
No, Mikey.

157
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,550
Two plus two is FOUR.

158
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,339
Carrots are green.

159
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,420
No, Mikey.

160
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,640
Carrots are ORANGE.

161
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,890
Another reason to add extra stress is that
you want to contrast two ideas.

162
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,140
For example:

163
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:42,060
i didn’t want CAPPUCINO; i wanted an AMERICANO.

164
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:47,080
she doesn’t live in PARIS; she lives in
ROME.

165
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,200
the flight left at TEN? but i thought it left
at TWELVE!

166
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,840
Finally, you might add extra stress just to
emphasise one idea in your sentence, like

167
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,850
this:

168
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,970
ARE you going to london tomorrow?

169
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:08,330
--> Meaning: I’m emphasising the question,
because I want a yes or no answer from you.

170
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,910
are YOU going to london tomorrow?

171
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:15,949
--> Meaning: I know some other people are
going to London, but I want to know if you

172
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:16,949
are going.

173
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:21,000
This stress pattern is often used to show
surprise.

174
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,550
are you going to london TOMORROW?

175
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:28,519
--> Meaning: I know you’re going to London
on another day, but I want to know specifically

176
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,920
about tomorrow.

177
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,439
Again, this suggests that I’m surprised.

178
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,360
In all of these cases, you add extra stress
to one word in the sentence.

179
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,149
This doesn’t replace ‘regular’ sentence
stress.

180
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:47,259
Instead, it’s like an extra layer on top
of it.

181
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:55,300
In the question Are you going to London tomorrow,
the content words going, London and tomorrow

182
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,829
are stressed.

183
00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:01,599
If you want to add stress to emphasise one
idea, then you add this on top of the existing

184
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,440
stress.

185
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,960
For example:

186
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,120
are YOU going to london tomorrow?

187
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:14,920
In this case, you add ‘regular’ sentence
stress to going, London and tomorrow, and

188
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,139
‘extra’ sentence stress to you.

189
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:23,470
The ‘extra’ stress should be stronger
than the ‘regular’ stress.

190
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,730
Try it!

191
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:31,269
Repeat after me: are YOU going to london tomorrow?

192
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:38,190
Try one more time: are YOU going to london
tomorrow?

193
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:44,330
Note that this ‘extra’ stress can be anywhere,
including on grammar words.

194
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:48,870
So now, you know the most important points
about sentence stress in English.

195
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:55,850

need to focus on most in your English pronunciation?
