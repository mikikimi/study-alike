00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,170
Hi, I’m Oli.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,170
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,460
In this lesson, you can learn how to talk
about your family in English.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,629
Do you have a big family?

5
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:16,619
What do you like doing when you spend time
with your family?

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,650
Talking about family can be a good way to
start a conversation in English, so it’s

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,640
useful if you know what to say and if you
have some questions to ask.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,840
Let’s start with something simple.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,850
Part one: introducing your family.

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,970
Let’s start with a simple sentence:

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,860
"There are ________ people in my family."

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,440
So you can say:

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,400
"There are five...

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,530
There are ten...

15
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,520
There are thirty people in my family."

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,079
That’s not too hard, but it’s not so interesting,
either!

17
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,000
You should say who these people are.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,829
"There are ten people in my family: I have
two sisters, one brother, my uncle and aunt,

19
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:06,400
two grandparents and my parents of course."

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,240
"There are four people in my family: my wife,
my two sons and myself."

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,440
Part two: Talking about your brothers and
sisters.

22
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,080
How many brothers and sisters do you have?

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,170
You could say:

24
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,610
"I have two brothers and one sister."

25
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,470
"I just have one sister."

26
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,400
"I’m an only child."

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:40,460
Let’s make it more interesting by adding
more information.

28
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,720
Are your brothers and sisters older or younger?

29
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,590
Where are you in the family?

30
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,439
"I have two older brothers and one older sister.

31
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,210
I’m the youngest in the family."

32
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,309
"I just have one sister, who’s five years
older than me."

33
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:01,700
"I’m the middle child: my brother is two
years older, and I have a younger sister who’s

34
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,310
finishing university this year."

35
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:09,789
Part three: talking about your immediate and
your extended family.

36
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:14,600
In English, we sometimes draw a line between
your immediate family.

37
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:21,510
That means: you, your husband/wife, your children,
parents, and brothers and sisters.

38
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,290
Then, you have your extended family.

39
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:34,200
That means: aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews,
nieces, grandparents, grandchildren, and so

40
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,260
on.

41
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,780
Now, you can give more details about the people
in your family, like this:

42
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,890
"My immediate family is quite small, because
I’m an only child.

43
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,989
My mum is one of five children, so I have
a lot of cousins, who are kind of like my

44
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,129
brothers and sisters.

45
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:59,581
There are six people in my immediate family:
my parents, my brother and his wife, my sister

46
00:02:59,581 --> 00:03:01,040
and me.

47
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,040
I have a lot of other relatives, but they
live in Canada so we don’t see them often."

48
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,780
Part four: talking about your children.

49
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,989
Do you have children?

50
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:14,530
Let’s see what you can say:

51
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,209
"I have three kids: two girls and a boy."

52
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:21,519
"We have a newborn son."

53
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:28,769
"We have one daughter, and my wife’s expecting
our second child."

54
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,800
As always, you should add details to make
your answers longer and more interesting:

55
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,379
"I have three kids: two girls and a boy.

56
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:43,040
Our eldest daughter has just started secondary
school, and the two younger ones are still

57
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
in primary school."

58
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,480
"We have a newborn son.

59
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,480
He’s just three weeks old now, so we’re
still getting used to things!"

60
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,298
"We have one daughter, and my wife’s expecting
our second child.

61
00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:00,629
We don’t know if it’s a boy or a girl,
but we’ll find out in three months."

62
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:04,190
Part five: talking about your relationship
with your family.

63
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:10,010
Finally, let’s add some information about
how often you see your family, and what you

64
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,600
like to do together.

65
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,040
For example:

66
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,450
"I’m very close to my family.

67
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,010
We have lunch together every weekend."

68
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:23,870
"I see my older brother once a week; we play
tennis or basketball together."

69
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,849
"I try to spend as much time as possible with
my kids."

70
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:30,020
What now?

71
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,330
You should know the answer: add more details!

72
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,849
Let's look:
"I’m very close to my family.

73
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:40,430
We have lunch together every weekend at my
grandmother’s house.

74
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,509
She always cooks something delicious!"

75
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:48,139
"I see my older brother once a week; we play
tennis or basketball together.

76
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:53,529
I don’t see my other brother so often, because
he lives overseas, although we talk on Skype

77
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:54,529
every so often."

78
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:59,110
"I try to spend as much time as possible with
my kids.

79
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,599
We play cards, watch films, or go to the park
if the weather’s nice."

80
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:07,649
Part six: making a longer answer.

81
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:12,210
Now you should be able to make a longer answer
talking about your family.

82
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,438
You should be able to talk about your relatives,
your brothers and sisters, your children if

83
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,169
you have any, and your relationship with your
family.

84
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:24,479
Let’s look at a sample answer:

85
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,830
"There are five people in my immediate family,
although my extended family is quite large.

86
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,669
I have two sisters, both younger, so I’m
the oldest child.

87
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:39,710
I don’t have kids yet but I’d like to
have a big family one day.

88
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,460
I see my parents and my sisters quite often,
because we all live near each other, although

89
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,750
I don’t see my other relatives that much."

90
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,969
OK?

91
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:50,748
Could you make an answer like this?

92
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:53,939
Let’s look at one more sample answer first:

93
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:59,629
"I come from a big family: I’m the fifth
child, and I have three brothers and one sister.

94
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:04,840
They’re all close to each other in age,
but there’s a big gap between them and me.

95
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,119
I don’t have children, but I have lots of
nieces and nephews!

96
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:13,270
I don’t see my family often because I live
in a different country, but I speak to them

97
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:18,698
regularly and we all get together once or
twice a year, which is always very noisy but

98
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:20,740
lots of fun."

99
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,119
What about you?

100
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:25,509
Try to make a longer answer talking about
your family.

101
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:29,770
Use the vocabulary and ideas from the lesson
to help you.

102
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,899
Next time you talk about your family in English,
hopefully you’ll have lots to talk about!

103
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:37,020
That’s the end of the lesson.

104
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,520
I hope it was useful.
