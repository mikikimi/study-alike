00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,949
Hi, my name’s Olivier, and welcome to Oxford
Online English.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,210
Hey Oli, I’m going to the UK soon.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,010
What can I do to get a taste of real British
culture?

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,650
How about going to the pub?

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,390
There are around 60,000 pubs in the UK, so
if you’re in the UK now, there is probably

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,100
one just around the corner!

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,369
Pubs are incredibly popular in the UK, and
traditional pubs still offer a glimpse of

8
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:28,869
true British culture.

9
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:34,989
Maybe you’ve been out sightseeing all day
and you’re looking for a nice place to relax.

10
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:38,989
No trip to the UK is complete without a visit
to the local pub.

11
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:43,498
In this lesson you’ll learn how to order
in a pub, and also how to sound like a real

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,340
local while you’re in there.

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,760
Imagine: you’ve found a beautiful old British
pub; you walk in and go to the bar.

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,260
The bartender asks: ‘What can I get you?’

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,720
What do you do?

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,500
Hello.

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,960
Hi, what can I get you?

18
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:03,679
Um…. beer.

19
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:04,679
Which beer?

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,000
Umm..… this one
Pint or a half?

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,920
What?

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,520
Big or small?

23
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,510
Big, please
Anything else?

24
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,510
What?

25
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,790
Do you want anything else?

26
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,620
Umm yes...wine, please..

27
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,720
Red or white?

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,400
Red.

29
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,220
We’ve got Merlot, Cab, or Pinot.

30
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,320
That one.

31
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,329
Large or small?

32
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:25,329
Small.

33
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:28,229
Okay, anything else?

34
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:29,880
Eight pounds forty please.

35
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,880
Cheers.

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,039
Thank you.

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,140
Okay, let’s be honest, that didn’t go so well.

38
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,440
Why not?

39
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,720
There were many issues with understanding
and using the vocabulary you need in the pub.

40
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,789
But, there’s good news!

41
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:47,200
The vocabulary that you need
in the pub is actually quite limited.

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,600
Let's see how that could have gone better.

43
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,039
Hi, what can I get you?

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,000
A pint of Kronenbourg and a small glass of
Merlot please.

45
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:55,009
Here you are.

46
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:56,009
Anything else?

47
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,320
No thanks, that’s all.

48
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,779
That’ll be eight forty.

49
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,680
Here you are.

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,420
Cheers.

51
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,420
Thanks.

52
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,600
I think you can see that was much better.

53
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,660
But what was different?

54
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,060
Mostly, she was more specific with the order.

55
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,599
That meant I didn’t have to ask her so many
questions, and the whole order didn’t take

56
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,380
much time.

57
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:22,370
Pubs are informal places, so it’s fine to
use very simple, direct language.

58
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:28,740
You can simply list the drinks you want, like
this: ‘one pint of IPA and two small glasses

59
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,230
of house white, please.’

60
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:39,090
You can use phrases like I’d like… or
Can I have…?, but they aren’t necessary.

61
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,350
This is true for the bartender, too.

62
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:46,819
You should expect to hear shortened questions,
like these: ‘Ice?’

63
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:49,429
‘Anything else?’

64
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,440
‘Draft or bottle?’

65
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,450
You should be ready for this, and not just
in the pub!

66
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,060
Shortened questions like these, for example
‘Ice?’

67
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,770
instead of ‘Do you want ice?’ are very
common in informal English.

68
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,129
Now you know the basics, let’s look at how
to order all the different kinds of drinks

69
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:15,540
you can find in a typical British pub.

70
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,620
Beer is by far the most popular drink ordered
in pubs.

71
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,750
Generally, you can choose from ale or lager.

72
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,239
‘Ale’ includes many kinds of beer.

73
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,560
Light ale is often called ‘bitter’, while
dark ale is often called ‘stout’.

74
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,250
Ale is especially popular in the UK, while
in some countries it isn’t a common drink.

75
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:45,700
‘Lager’ is the standard, light, fizzy
beer that is popular around the world.

76
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:54,399
So, a pub might have ales like Guinness, London
Pride, or Doom Bar, and lagers like Kronenbourg,

77
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,010
Fosters, Stella Artois, or Heineken.

78
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,120
Both ale and lagers come in bottles and draft.

79
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,790
‘Draft’ means from the tap.

80
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,709
The last thing to think about is the size.

81
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:12,920
There are normally just two options: a pint,
or a half-pint.

82
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,560
A pint is just over five hundred ml.

83
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,440
If you simply name the beer you want, the
bartender will generally assume that you want

84
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,969
a pint of draft beer.

85
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,840
If you want a half-pint or a bottle, it’s
better to say so directly.

86
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,719
Let’s see an example of ordering some beer.

87
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,340
Hi, can I have an Amstel please?

88
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,120
Pint?

89
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,420
Just a half, please.

90
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,640
Here you are.

91
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,340
Easy, right?

92
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,570
Let’s look at one more example, where it’s
a little more complicated.

93
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:49,090
Hi, two pints of Amstel, a bottle of Becks
and half a Fosters please.

94
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,940
Sorry, the Amstel’s off.

95
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,090
How about Grolsch?

96
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,140
Sure, that’s fine.

97
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,419
So that’s two pints of Grolsch, one bottle
of Becks, and a half of Fosters.

98
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,420
That’s right.

99
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,420
No problem.

100
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,360
Here you are.

101
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,420
Sometimes, the pub will run out of one kind
of beer.

102
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,810
If the bartender tells you that something
is ‘off’, that means they don’t have

103
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,810
any more.

104
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,601
In the past the selection of wines in pubs
was quite limited, but now you will often

105
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:17,800
find pubs with a large selection of wines.

106
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,840
If you want to see which wines the pub has,
you could ask: ‘Do you have a wine list?’

107
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,859
You could also ask:

108
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,280
‘What red/white wines do you have?’

109
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,299
Do you have a Pinot Grigio?’

110
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,260
Let’s see an example of ordering wine.

111
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,420
Hi, what can I get you?

112
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,520
Yes, what red wines do you have?

113
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,740
We’ve got a Pinot Noir, a Sauvignon Zinfandel
and a Malbec.

114
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,750
Two large glasses of Pinot Noir please

115
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,960
Okay, no problem.

116
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,880
That’s four fifty, please.

117
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
Are you sure?

118
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
That seems cheap…

119
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,980
It’s happy hour till six, so they’re two-for-one.

120
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,720
‘Happy
hour’ is a time, usually early in the evening,

121
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,280
when pubs and bars have special offers on
drinks.

122
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,869
Here, the wines were ‘two-for-one’, meaning
you can buy one and get one free.

123
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,500
Let’s look at a slightly more complicated
example of ordering wine.

124
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,820
Hi, what can I get you?

125
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,860
Hi, do you have a Pinot Grigio?.

126
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,860
No, sorry.

127
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,440
We’ve only got Chardonnay or Cabernet Blanc.

128
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,780
Hmm.

129
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,719
I don’t really like either of those.

130
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,020
What about rosé?

131
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,780
We only have one: a Syrah.

132
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,859
Okay, that’s perfect.

133
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,380
A large glass of Syrah and two small glasses
of Chardonnay.

134
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,320
Anything else?

135
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,680
No that’s all,

136
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
thanks.

137
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,440
That’ll be eleven pounds twenty, please.

138
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
Can I start a tab?

139
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
Of course.

140
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,400
I’ll just need to swipe a card.

141
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,659
Did you hear that phrase at the end: “Can
I start a tab?”

142
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,100
Can you guess what it means?

143
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,560
A tab means that you pay for everything when
you leave the pub.

144
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:56,070
Normally, you pay for food and drinks as you
order them, but if you’re planning to stay

145
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:01,000
in the pub for some time, you might start
a tab so that you can order food and drinks

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,760
quickly and conveniently.

147
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,340
You’ve seen how to order beer and wine;
what other kind of drinks could you order?

148
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,450
You could also order spirits or mixed drinks.

149
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:19,659
‘Spirits’ includes hard alcohol like vodka,
whiskey, gin, rum, and so on.

150
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,750
You can also order mixed drinks, like vodka
and coke or gin and tonic.

151
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:30,510
Some pubs might serve cocktails, although
it’s more common for bars to serve cocktails.

152
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:35,469
There’s a difference between pubs and bars
in the UK!

153
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:42,300
Ordering mixed drinks is easy: put the spirit
first, then the mixer, like this: vodka and

154
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:49,930
orange, whiskey and coke, rum and ginger beer.

155
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,770
Hi, what can I get you?

156
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,969
Two rum and cokes, a vodka lemonade and a
gin and tonic please.

157
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,970
Anything else?

158
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,560
Oh, and a whiskey, please.

159
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,220
Straight?

160
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,080
Yes.

161
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,800
Ice?

162
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,980
No thanks.

163
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,420
Do you remember what was ordered?

164
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:12,300
I asked for: two rum and cokes, a vodka lemonade,
a gin and tonic and a straight whiskey.

165
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,930
In pubs, it’s common to leave out the word
‘and’ when ordering mixed drinks, so you

166
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,530
can say, ‘gin and tonic’ or ‘gin tonic’.

167
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,210
‘Straight’ here means without a any mixer.

168
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:30,390
If you want to sound like a real local, and
you want ice with the drink, you can say ‘on

169
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,510
the rocks’.

170
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,510
For example.,

171
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:38,200
‘A Glenlivet on the rocks please.’

172
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,110
Of course, you don’t just come to the pub
to drink!

173
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,740
In recent years the food in pubs has really
improved, and you can often find some nice

174
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,100
traditional food.

175
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,000
Pubs aren’t restaurants, so you need to
order food at the bar.

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,180
The menu will often be written on a blackboard
near the bar somewhere.

177
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,560
Let’s see how to order food in a pub.

178
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,449
Hi, what can I get for you?

179
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,940
Can I order some food please?

180
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,540
Yes, of course.

181
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,870
What table number are you?

182
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,740
Sorry, I’m not sure.

183
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,519
It’s that table in the corner.

184
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,670
Okay, no problem.

185
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,839
That’s table 7.

186
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:14,839
What would you like?

187
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,950
I’d like a one fish scampi and chips and
a steak and ale pie.

188
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,950
Anything else?

189
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,760
Yes, do you have anything for children?

190
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,920
Yes, just down here we have a few things for
children.

191
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,490
Ah, excellent.

192
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,160
… And a spaghetti Bolognese as well please.

193
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,020
Okay, anything else?

194
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:31,180
No, that’s everything.

195
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,239
Great, that’s twenty-three seventy please.

196
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,510
Here you are.

197
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,800
Thank you.

198
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,800
Cutlery and condiments are over on the table
in the corner; you can just help yourself.

199
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,459
Thanks.

200
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,829
Do you remember what I ordered?

201
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:47,000
There were three things.

202
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,990
I ordered a scampi and chips, a steak and
ale pie and a spaghetti Bolognese.

203
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:59,000
‘Scampi’ is shrimp which is covered in
breadcrumbs and deep-fried.

204
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,920
‘Steak and ale pie’ is a traditional English
pub dish.

205
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:08,199
It’s a pie with thick pastry, with beef
cooked in ale inside.

206
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:12,248
Do you remember the first question the bartender
asked?

207
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:16,180
She asked, ‘What table number are you?’

208
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,599
Often you will see a number somewhere on the
table.

209
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,680
You need to tell the bartender your table
number when you order food.

210
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,239
The only other question Oli asked was, ‘Do
you have anything for children?’

211
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,699
Very often pubs will have a specific menu
for children.

212
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:37,149
If you can’t see it on the menu, you can
always ask.

213
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:42,660
Finally, at the end of the dialogue, I mentioned
some things on the table in the corner.

214
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,219
Do you remember what I said?

215
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,940
I said that the cutlery and condiments were
on the table.

216
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,800
‘Cutlery’ means knives, forks and spoons.

217
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,400
‘Condiments’ could be ketchup, mustard,
mayonnaise, or salt and pepper for example.

218
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,060
Right, now you have your drink, and you’re
waiting for your food.

219
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,579
It’s time to do some talking.

220
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:14,340
Next, you’ll see some slang and idioms that
you might hear and say in the pub.

221
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,920
I think you’ve got the basics now, but if
you want to practice your English, you should

222
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,069
speak to other people besides the bartender.

223
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:27,089
Watch a dialogue and try to find the idioms
and slang.

224
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:28,089
Is he alright?

225
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:29,889
He’s just had one too many.

226
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,480
He’s not drinking any more, is he?

227
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,250
No, no, he got cut off about an hour ago.

228
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,209
That’s probably for the best.

229
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:38,319
How about you?

230
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,330
Just a little tipsy, I got here late.

231
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,339
They’re closing soon, right?

232
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:46,129
Yeah, they just called last orders, but I
think some people are going to John’s place

233
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:47,180
for a bit of a piss-up.

234
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,520
Hmm…

235
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,180
I’ll come for a bit, but I can’t stay
long.

236
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,939
I’ve got work in the morning and I don’t
want to be hungover.

237
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,649
That’s what everyone says.

238
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:59,100
Anyway, let’s go, bottoms up!

239
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,870
So, what did you hear?

240
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,510
At the beginning, I said, ‘He’s had one
too many’.

241
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,300
This is used to describe somebody who is drunk.

242
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:16,699
There are many other words you can use here,
like ‘pissed,’ ‘smashed’, ‘hammered,’

243
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,740
‘battered,’ ‘wasted,’…

244
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,800
Okay, we get it!

245
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,370
There are many slang words you can use here.

246
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,610
You also heard ‘he got cut off about an
hour ago’.

247
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:32,259
‘Cut off’ means that the bar staff refuse
to sell you any more alcohol, because you’ve

248
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:33,889
drunk too much already.

249
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:37,019
The next word was ‘tipsy.’

250
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,730
This is the feeling when you’ve had one
or two drinks.

251
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,540
You aren’t drunk, but you can feel something
from the alcohol.

252
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,319
I invited Stephanie to John’s house for
a ‘piss-up’.

253
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:54,149
This is a very informal way to describe a
drinking session with a group of people.

254
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:59,389
Don’t expect to be drinking a cup of tea
at a piss-up!

255
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:04,320
At the end of the evening, the bartender will
call last orders.

256
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,079
Sometimes they shout across the pub, or sometimes
they ring a big bell.

257
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,349
This is your last chance to order drinks before
the pub closes.

258
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,480
I said that I didn’t want to be ‘hungover.’

259
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,600
This isn’t really slang or an idiom, but
is a very common event after a night in the

260
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,060
pub.

261
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,469
When you wake up feeling terrible, it’s
because you are hungover

262
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,430
The last phrase was ‘bottoms up.’

263
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,890
This a way of saying, finish your drink and
often said as you are getting ready to leave

264
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,370
the pub.

265
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,550
Now you should know how to order different
drinks in a pub, so next time you’re walking

266
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:46,060
past an old traditional pub, why not stop
for a quick drink!

267
