00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,189
Hi, I’m Justin.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,990
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:09,360
In this lesson, you’ll learn useful words
and phrases to use at the airport.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,739
When’s the last time you flew somewhere?

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,600
Did it go smoothly, or was it stressful?

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,660
For your next flight, let’s make sure you
can communicate at every stage of your journey.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,380
This lesson will show you the English vocabulary
you need to do that.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,280
Let’s start with the first thing at the
airport: checking in.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,240
Hello.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello there! Where are you flying to today?.

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,160
I’m going to London.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,169
And have you checked in online already?

13
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,854
Yes, I have, but I was wondering: can I
change my seat?

14
00:00:42,854 --> 00:00:46,050
I have an aisle seat, but would I’d really
like a window seat if that’s possible.

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,760
Let’s have a look.

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,320
Can I have your passport please?

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,590
Yes of course.

18
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,660
Thank you.

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,980
One minute, let me check whether there’s
another seat available…

20
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,099
Yes, we can do that, sir.

21
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:01,109
Excellent.

22
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,410
Do you need a paper copy of your boarding
pass?

23
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,039
No thanks; I have it on my phone.

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,560
And do you have any bags to check in?

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,590
No, I only have a carry -on bag.

26
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,630
That’s fine.

27
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,270
You just need to put this tag on it.

28
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Like this?

29
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,539
That’s perfect!

30
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,740
Well, you’re ready to go.

31
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,750
Enjoy your trip!

32
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,080
Thank you very much.

33
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,640
Can you remember what questions the employee
asked the passenger?

34
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,650
She asked:

35
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,740
Where are you flying to today?

36
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,210
Have you checked in online already?

37
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,699
Can I have your passport please?

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,260
Do you need a paper copy of your boarding
pass?

39
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,600
Do you have any bags to check in?

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,699
These are common questions.

41
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:50,539
You might hear the same ideas with slightly
different words; for example:

42
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,030
Do you have your passport?

43
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:56,170
Or: Do you need to check in any bags?

44
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,860
However, even if the words are different,
the idea stays the same!

45
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,700
Most of these questions are simple; you can
just give a yes/no answer.

46
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,660
However, you might have some questions of
your own.

47
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,099
Can you remember what the passenger asked
for?

48
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,099
He asked:

49
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:17,760
Could I change my seat?

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,899
Can you think of any other requests you might
have as a passenger?

51
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,900
You might ask:

52
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,840
Can you confirm that I have a vegetarian meal?

53
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,100
Do you have any seats in the exit row?

54
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,440
Exit row seats have more legroom, so they’re often more comfortable!

55
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:44,960
This time, check-in went smoothly, but what if everything doesn’t go so well?

56
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,019
I’m sorry ma’am, but this bag is overweight.

57
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,460
The limit is 23 kilos.

58
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,500
You either need to take some things out,
or pay for the excess.

59
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,300
How much is the excess?

60
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,140
It’s fifty euros for a bag
up to 32 kilos..

61
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,859
That’s expensive!

62
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,160
I’ll try to take some things out.

63
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,810
I’m sorry, but the flight is delayed by
at least two hours.

64
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,900
So, when do you expect the plane to leave?

65
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,380
Right now, we expect it to depart at 10.30pm.

66
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,920
I do apologize for the inconvenience.

67
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,739
Well, I guess there’s nothing we can
do.

68
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,520
Thank you for your patience.

69
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,740
You can check the departure boards for updated boarding times and flight information.

70
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,340
I’m sorry, but this your flight has been
cancelled due to bad weather.

71
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,460
But, I really need to be in London tomorrow
afternoon.

72
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,280
When's the next available flight?

73
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,209
Let me see what we can do...

74
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:38,860
We do have a flight leaving tomorrow morning
that I can switch you to.

75
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,580
What time in the morning?

76
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,410
It leaves here at 7am, and arrives at 10.

77
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,410
That will be fine.

78
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,970
Right, here's a printed confirmation.

79
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,930
And again I am very sorry for the trouble.

80
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,500
That’s okay; it’s not your fault.

81
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,290
Are there any hotels near the airport?

82
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,640
Yes, of course. If you go to the
customer service desk, just over there, you

83
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,299
can claim a voucher for a hotel and meals.

84
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,670
Excellent, thank you.

85
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,220
You’re welcome.

86
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,790
In this section, you saw three different problems.

87
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,590
What were they?

88
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,430
Your baggage might be overweight.

89
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,840
Your flight might be delayed…
or even cancelled.

90
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:23,109
If your bag is overweight, you either have
to repack it, or pay excess baggage charges.

91
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,700
With delays and cancellations, you might have
no choice but to wait.

92
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:33,180
However, the airline generally needs to give
you hotel vouchers or meal vouchers if you

93
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,440
have to wait a long time for your flight.

94
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,780
Have you ever had problems like this?

95
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,419
What happened?

96
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,800
Hopefully, your next flight will go more smoothly.

97
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,420
Let’s move on to the next step in your journey.

98
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,690
Is this your bag, sir?

99
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,060
Yes, it is.

100
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,320
We need to search it.

101
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,540
Do you have any liquids?

102
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,540
No problem.

103
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,190
No, I don’t think so.

104
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,390
I’m afraid we need to take this bottle.

105
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,479
You’re allowed containers up to 100ml maximum.

106
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,750
Okay, sorry, I completely forgot.

107
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,020
And this Swiss knife has to go, too.

108
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,630
But, it’s important to me!

109
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,240
I can take it, or you’ll have to go back and check this bag.

110
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,070
Well I don’t have time for that; I guess
you’ll have to take it.

111
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,599
Very well, sir.

112
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,640
Here's your bag.

113
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,900
Thanks.

114
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,719
Excuse me, I’m really late for my flight,

115
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,620
can I go to the front of the line?

116
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,840
Okay, come forward quickly.

117
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,150
Make sure everything is out of your
pockets, and please place laptops in a separate

118
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,239
tray.

119
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,480
Please step over this way, ma’am.

120
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,210
I’m really late for my flight, could I just…

121
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,960
Ma’am, please step over here.

122
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,820
Stand on the marks on the floor and raise
your arms above you.

123
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,260
Do you have anything in your pockets?

124
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,580
Yes, sorry.

125
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,719
I still have some money and

126
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,820
my keys.

127
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,260
Please put them in the tray and come
through again.

128
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,960
And where's my bag?

129
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,039
It looks like your bag needs to be searched.

130
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,360
This is ridiculous; I’m going to miss my
flight.

131
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,580
Do you have anything sharp in here?

132
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,580
No, nothing.

133
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,510
You can’t take the jars on the airplane.

134
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,400
Why not?

135
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,039
It’s a liquid, ma’am.

136
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,320
No liquids over 100ml.

137
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,400
This is crazy!

138
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
It’s only honey!

139
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,260
I’m afraid those are the rules.

140
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,300
Fine, keep them.

141
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,520
Whew, a stressful experience!

142
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,580
Let’s take a look at some of the useful
language from these dialogues.

143
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,440
At the beginning, the security officer asked:

144
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,910
Is this your bag, sir?

145
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:33,420
Can you think of five more questions or requests
that you might hear when going through security?

146
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:40,090
If you want more time to think, pause the
video and write down your ideas.

147
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,429
You might be asked:

148
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,520
Is this your bag?

149
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,000
Do you have any liquids?

150
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,440
Do you have anything in your pockets?

151
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:52,060
You might also hear requests, such as:

152
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,669
Please place laptops in a separate tray.

153
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:59,880
Stand on the marks on the floor and raise
your arms.

154
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,400
As you saw, there’s no point arguing when
you’re going through security!

155
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,539
Now, you made it through, and you caught your
plane—finally!

156
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,940
Time to sit back and relax.

157
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,200
Excuse me, sir?

158
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,320
Would it be alright if we put your bag in
the overhead locker?

159
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,099
Erm… well..

160
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,669
I’d prefer to keep it with me.

161
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:24,770
It’s just that you’re sitting in an emergency
exit row.

162
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,539
We can’t have anything on the floor.

163
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,080
Okay, do what you must.

164
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,050
I also need to ask you to raise your window
blind and make sure your seat back is in the

165
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,450
upright position for take-off.

166
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,259
Why do I have to do all this?

167
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:38,150
It’s standard procedure for take-off, sir.

168
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,099
You can recline your seat and take your bag
down once we’re airborne.

169
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,229
During take-off and landing, there are certain
things you have to do.

170
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:50,008
Do you know what they are?

171
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:51,009
You need to:

172
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:53,580
Fasten your seat belt.

173
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,039
Stow your tray table.

174
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,630
Stow means put away.

175
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,319
Raise your window blind.

176
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:04,449
The window blind is a screen that you
can use to cover the window.

177
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,919
Move your seat back to the upright position.

178
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,889
During your flight, you can recline your
seat, and lean back.

179
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:17,030
But, for take-off and landing, you need to
put it back to the straight position.

180
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,830
Stow your luggage in the overhead locker or
under the seat in front of you.

181
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:26,340
Of course, in our dialogue, the passenger
was sitting in an exit row seat. She had

182
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,080
to use the overhead locker.

183
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,219
The flight attendants might ask you to do

184
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,200
one or two other things, like take out your headphones.

185
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,300
On the last flight you took, did they serve food?

186
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,740
It’s getting less common to have food included
with a flight, but let’s imagine your flight

187
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,780
includes a meal.

188
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,280
Hello, can I help you?

189
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,140
Yes, I ordered a special meal online, but
it hasn’t arrived yet.

190
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,719
Okay, I can go and check; which meal did you
order?

191
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
The gluten free option.

192
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,949
Oh, I’m sorry, I think there has been a
mistake.

193
00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:00,300
We just gave out the last gluten free meal.

194
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,729
But I ordered it online!

195
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,290
I’m so sorry, there must have been some
confusion.

196
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,319
You can have anything else from our menu.

197
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:11,769
I can only eat gluten-free dishes, so that’s
no use.

198
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:14,129
Also, my screen’s not working!

199
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:15,649
I’m very sorry about that, ma’am.

200
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:18,209
It’s a twelve-hour flight!

201
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,790
What am I supposed to do?

202
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,920
No food, and no TV.

203
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,930
Ma’am, we can offer you an upgrade to business
class, so that you have a working TV screen.

204
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,969
Business class?

205
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,000
Let’s go!

206
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,760
Follow me, please, ma’am.

207
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,000
Here, we had some problems during the flight.

208
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:38,649
What other problems could you have on the
plane?

209
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:43,569
You might find that you don’t have something
you need, like a blanket or a pillow.

210
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:46,170
You could get the wrong meal.

211
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:51,140
You might need to change seats, because the
person next to you is snoring loudly!

212
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,220
Hopefully, none of these things will happen
to you.

213
00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:00,230
And if they do, you might get lucky and get
upgraded to business class, like I did!

214
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,470
Now, your plane is coming in to land.

215
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,900
You’ve made it!

216
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,640
There’s just one more thing you have to
do.

217
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,280
Hello.

218
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,120
Hello.

219
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:11,809
What is the purpose of your visit?

220
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:13,160
I have a business meeting.

221
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,219
Where is the meeting?

222
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,459
It’s at a law firm in London.

223
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:17,790
And how long are you staying?

224
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,790
Until Tuesday.

225
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,829
Please put your right hand on the scanner.

226
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,069
Thank you.

227
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:24,110
Now look into the camera here.

228
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,600
1, 2, 3.…

229
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,259
That’s great.

230
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:29,769
Thank you and enjoy your stay.

231
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:31,230
Thank you.

232
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,850
This process is different around the world.

233
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,410
Sometimes they won’t even speak to you; they just scan your passport.

234
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:42,689
But what did the border control officer
ask here?

235
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:44,079
Her first question was,

236
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,880
‘What is the purpose of your visit?’.

237
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,620
How could you answer this?

238
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,680
You could say:

239
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,020
I’m here on business.

240
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,360
I’m just on holiday.

241
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,660
I’m visiting some relatives.

242
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:03,520
It is possible that they might ask you for
some extra information about why you are here

243
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,600
and what your plans are. For example,

244
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,700
Where are you staying?

245
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,580
What company are you visiting?

246
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,260
How long are you staying?

247
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,439
Okay, now you should have all of the English
you need for the next time you fly.

248
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,180
We hope that this will make those stressful
airport experiences a little easier!

249
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:30,059
Here’s a question: have you ever had a really
bad experience at the airport or on a plane?

250
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:32,310
Please share your stories in the comments!

251
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,518
Thanks for watching, and remember that you can find more videos like these this

252
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:39,470

253

See you next time!.
