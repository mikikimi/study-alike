00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,219
Hello, I’m Daniel.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,170
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:12,639
In this lesson, you can learn to respond naturally
in conversations in English.

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:19,210
If you simply stare at the other person when
they’re talking to you, your conversations

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,560
might not go so well.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,119
We’re partly joking, but when you’re speaking
a second language, you often need to concentrate

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,870
on understanding what the other person is
saying.

8
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:38,599
This means you might forget to respond naturally,
but natural responses are important to keep

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,999
your conversation going, and also to show
the other person that you care about what

10
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:46,519
they’re saying.

11
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:52,910
This lesson will show you natural conversational
responses which you can use to express interest,

12
00:00:52,910 --> 00:01:01,199
surprise, agreement, confusion, and much more!

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,830
When someone’s telling you a story, it’s
important to show interest in what they’re

14
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:06,830
saying.

15
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,149
First, let’s see what not to do.

16
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,500
The other day, I met up with an old friend
from high school.

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,190
It was great to catch up with him!

18
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,190
Mmm-hmm.

19
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,160
He’s had such an interesting life.

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,060
At the moment, he’s working in an orangutan
sanctuary in Borneo.

21
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,520
Mmm-hmm.

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:31,649
Next, he told me he’s planning to develop
a spaceship which can take humans to Mars!

23
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:40,450
Mmm-hmm. Of course, you can nod your head and
say mmm-hmm or hmm, but that doesn’t sound

24
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,600
like you’re very interested.

25
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,410
There are other ways to show that you’re
engaged.

26
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,030
Let’s look at a better way to do this.

27
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,400
I had a chat with my boss the other day and
he’s putting me on this great new project.

28
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Really?

29
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,920
That’s great!

30
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,290
So I visited my family last Sunday and we
had a lovely barbecue.

31
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,100
Sounds nice!

32
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,089
The exam was really hard, I’m not sure if
I’ve passed it.

33
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:11,120
Is that right? Of course, you
can’t be interested in everything that someone

34
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,690
is saying to you.

35
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,520
But, it’s still helpful to show that you’re
listening, and that you understand what the

36
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,580
other person is saying.

37
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,231
Let’s see some useful phrases you can use
to do this. My car broke down last week, so

38
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,920
I had to get it repaired.

39
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,059
Oh, yeah?

40
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,650
It seemed like it was leaking oil.

41
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,730
I see.

42
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,090
They told me it wasn’t too bad, they could
get it fixed easily.

43
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,290
Uh-huh.

44
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:44,480
Some situations need stronger responses, for
example if you hear something surprising.

45
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,299
My sister broke up with her boyfriend.

46
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,360
Seriously?

47
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,040
Yeah, it turned out he was seeing someone
else.

48
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,739
You must be joking!

49
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,220
It was her best friend!

50
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,900
No way! In this section, you saw how to show
interest,

51
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,819
understanding and surprise.

52
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,920
How many of the responses can you remember?

53
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:11,730
Take a look, and pause the video if you need
more time to read.

54
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,310
I think we’re done here, right?

55
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,180
I don’t think so, actually.

56
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,370
That last episode of Game of Thrones was amazing!

57
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,760
For sure!

58
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,899
I really like Sarah’s new haircut.

59
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,140
It looks great on her.

60
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,959
Absolutely!

61
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,920
People shouldn’t be so negative, especially
if they don’t have anything to contribute

62
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:34,930
themselves.

63
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:41,520
I couldn’t agree more! Of course, sometimes
you might NOT agree with the other person.

64
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,000
How could you respond then?

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,220
I’m glad Eric got the promotion to be our
team leader.

66
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,810
He’s such a great guy!

67
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,500
I’m not so sure about that.

68
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,150
I think I’m going to take my husband to
a spa.

69
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,760
I’m sure he’ll enjoy it.

70
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,239
You really think so?

71
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,750
The media should stop talking about celebrities
getting together and breaking up.

72
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,750
Who cares?!

73
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:09,930
I don’t see it that way; if people want
to read about it, why not let them? In this

74
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:17,180
section, you’ve seen three phrases you can
use to agree, and three phrases to disagree.

75
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,820
Can you remember them all?

76
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,099
Next, how about some language to respond to
suggestions?

77
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,220
Great idea!

78
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:36,760
Whenever you want to make plans with friends,
decide on a place to have dinner or plan a

79
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,900
meeting with colleagues, you’ll need to
respond to other people’s suggestions.

80
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,661
Let’s see how you can do this. Why don’t
we go for a bike ride this Saturday?

81
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,940
Sorry, I can’t on Saturday.

82
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,350
What about Sunday?

83
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,300
Ok, Sunday it is!

84
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,560
It’s Rita’s birthday tomorrow.

85
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,910
How about we buy her a bottle of wine from
the team?

86
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,240
I’m not sure if she likes wine.

87
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,950
Maybe we can get her some flowers and chocolate?

88
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,190
That sounds good!

89
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,800
What do you think of this colour for the living
room?

90
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,960
I don’t know…

91
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:12,180
It looks quite dark.

92
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,120
I think it’ll make the room feel gloomy.

93
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,760
Can we try a lighter shade?

94
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:23,560
Yeah, sure. Here, you saw three phrases you
can use to reject a suggestion, and three

95
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,270
phrases to accept.

96
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,270
Can you remember any of them?

97
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:36,560
Here are the phrases you saw; pause the video
if you need more time to read:

98
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,980
You can see that it’s common to use a vague
phrase to reject a suggestion, like I’m

99
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,190
not sure or I don’t know.

100
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,880
This is important as a non-native speaker
of English: people are often more indirect

101
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,159
when saying ‘no’ to something.

102
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,960
Of course, this depends on the culture you’re
in, and the people you’re with.

103
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,500
However, it’s a good idea to remember that
if you make a suggestion, and people reply

104
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:10,509
in very vague ways, they will often be saying
‘no’ to your idea. I’m confused about

105
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:12,259
what Daniel means…

106
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:19,729
If only there was some way I could ask him
to clarify what he said.

107
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:23,060
My computer just crashed, I think it has a
virus.

108
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,480
You should start it in Safe Mode and run a
virus scan.

109
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,590
You’ve lost me.

110
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,049
What’s “safe mode”?

111
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,580
It’s a special way to start your computer,
use F8 when you turn on the computer and it

112
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,359
will start the system in safe mode.

113
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,360
Sorry, I didn’t catch that; could you say
it one more time?

114
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,230
So, press F8 as soon as you turn on the computer,
and when the system starts, you can scan for

115
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,230
viruses.

116
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:51,680
Okay, so, you mean that I need to turn on
the computer, press F8, and then run the virus

117
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,520
scan?

118
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,479
That’s right.

119
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,620
And then what?

120
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,880
It depends what the virus scan shows.

121
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,710
Hold on, are you saying that I might have
to do more stuff after that?

122
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,460
This sounds like a huge hassle.

123
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,789
Well, sure.

124
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,200
If you have a virus or other malware, you’ll
need to remove it.

125
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,560
I think I’ll just take it to the shop.

126
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,020
Suit yourself!

127
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:19,448
It’s common not to understand exactly what
someone else said, even for native speakers.

128
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:23,639
Even if you understood, you might need more
information.

129
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:31,699
In these cases, you can use these phrases
to ask for clarification. Now, you’ve learned

130
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:37,759
some natural conversational responses to deal
with many different situations in English.

131
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,920
Let’s practice what you’ve learned!

132
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,389
Now it’s time to practice!

133
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:49,320
We’ll show you some phrases which you need
to respond to.

134
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,590
Depending on the situation, there are often
different ways in which you can respond.

135
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,030
Let’s do an example together!

136
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,758
Here’s a phrase:

137
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,509
I need to go to the shop to buy couscous.

138
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:05,580
And here are three possible responses:

139
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,560
Why don’t we go together?

140
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,130
OK, I see.

141
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,880
You’ve lost me.

142
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,980
What’s couscous?

143
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,930
You can respond with a suggestion: “Why
don’t we go together?”

144
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:23,860
Maybe you just want to show you understood,
so you say: “OK, I see”.

145
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:30,410
But, maybe you don’t understand what your
friend needs to buy, so you ask: “You’ve

146
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,669
lost me.

147
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:33,539
What’s couscous?”

148
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,649
For the next phrases, think of responses you
would give.

149
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:42,120
We’ll show some examples on the screen,
but of course, there are many good ways to

150
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,120
respond!

151
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
Ready?

152
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,430
Here’s your first sentence.

153
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,729
Last weekend I finally bought a new phone,
but when I got home and opened the box, it

154
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:57,660
turned out they had given me the wrong one!

155
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,360
Here’s another one.

156
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,810
Think about how you would respond.

157
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:10,579
Justin Bieber is the best singer in the world;
I can’t wait to go to his concert!

158
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,860
Let’s do one more:

159
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:21,120
How about we go hiking in the mountains this
weekend? To practice, tell us which responses

160
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,060
you would choose, and why.

161
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,939
Let us know in the comments, and you can check
that you’re using these phrases in a natural

162
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,950
way!

163
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,390
