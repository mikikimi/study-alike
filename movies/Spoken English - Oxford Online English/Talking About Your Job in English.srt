00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,970
Hi, I’m Mike and welcome to Oxford Online
English!

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,790
In this lesson, you can learn how to talk
about your job in English.

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,790
Where do you work?

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,239
What do you have to do in your job?

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,500
What kind of company do you work for?

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,539
In this class, you can learn how to answer
questions like this in clear, detailed English.

7
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:27,539
Ready?

8
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:28,649
Let’s start!

9
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:31,580
Part one: introducing your job.

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:37,719
"I’m a ________": "I work in ________";
"I work for _________."

11
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:41,269
How would you complete these sentences?

12
00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:43,010
You could say something like:

13
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,480
"I’m a writer.

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,089
I work in online education.

15
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:50,050
I work for a publishing company."

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,190
'I work in...' is used with a field, meaning
a type of work.

17
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,530
So, you can say things like:

18
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,060
"I work in finance."

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,249
"I work in digital marketing."

20
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:07,730
You can also use 'work in' with a place or
a department of a company.

21
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,730
For example:

22
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,040
"I work in the HR department of a financial
firm."

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,470
"I work in a school, teaching modern languages."

24
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,830
Confused?

25
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:24,350
You can see that if you use 'work in' to talk
about the type of work you do, you don’t

26
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,110
use an article like 'a' or 'the'.

27
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:34,270
If you use an article 'a' or 'the' after 'work
in', it means you’re talking about the place

28
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,759
or department where you work.

29
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,310
'I work for…' is used with a company.

30
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,590
So, you could say:

31
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,180
"I’m a salesman.

32
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,610
I work for a mobile phone company."

33
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,780
"I work for a law firm based in Frankfurt."

34
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,390
Or even:
"I run my own business, so I work for myself."

35
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,880
What can you say?

36
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,420
Can you make sentences like this to say something
about your job?

37
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,290
Pause the video and try to make a sentence.

38
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,060
Say it aloud!

39
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,530
Next, let’s add more details to your answer.

40
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,980
Part two: describing your company.

41
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:22,230
"I work for a _________ company which __________"

42
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,459
Look at this sentence.

43
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,530
We need one adjective, and the end of the
sentence after 'which'.

44
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,920
Any ideas?

45
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:37,579
For the adjectives, think about these ideas:
is your company big or small?

46
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,420
Local or multinational?

47
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,299
For the part after 'which', ask yourself:
what does your company do?

48
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,300
Does it make things, sell things, organise
things?

49
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,630
Does it provide products, services, or both?

50
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,250
So, you could say:

51
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,290
"I work for an international electronics company
which makes tablet computers."

52
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:08,899
"I work for a German company which does market
research for other companies."

53
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,580
What if you don’t work for a company?

54
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,540
Here are some things you could say:

55
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,780
"I’m a freelancer."

56
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,760
Meaning: I work independently, for different
people and companies.

57
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,310
"I’m self-employed."

58
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:30,150
Meaning: I work for myself, either freelance
or I have my own business.

59
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,260
"I’m a business owner."

60
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:39,329
If you don’t work, and people ask you what
you do, what can you say?

61
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,480
Here are some useful phrases:

62
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,480
"I’m between jobs at the moment."

63
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,950
Meaning: I’ve left one job, and haven’t
found another yet.

64
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,670
This sounds nicer than saying, “I’m unemployed.”

65
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:58,429
"I’m taking some time out to…(travel,
spend time with my kids, write a book, recover

66
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:04,370
from an illness, etc.)" Meaning: I’m not
working at the moment because I want to focus

67
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,020
on something else.

68
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,739
"I’m retired."

69
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,400
What about you?

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,720
Do you work for a company?

71
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,980
What can you say about it?

72
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:23,240
If you don’t work for a company, how would
you describe your work situation?

73
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,279
Part three: how to describe your job in more
detail.

74
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:32,840
So what do you actually do all day?

75
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,960
Let’s see how you can describe your job
in more detail.

76
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,520
Look at these sentences:

77
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,620
"I have to _________"; "I’m responsible
for _________"; "Most of my time is spent

78
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,830
_________".

79
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,609
Let’s do some examples together.

80
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,919
We’ll start with a simple example.

81
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,159
"I’m a nurse.

82
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:59,590
I have to look after patients, give them medicine
and make sure they’re comfortable.

83
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,549
I’m responsible for about 20-30 patients.

84
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:09,569
Most of my time is spent talking to patients
and checking that everything is okay."

85
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:14,780
Next, let’s do a more detailed example.

86
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,229
"I have to design websites to the client’s
specifications.

87
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:25,580
I’m responsible for the whole design process,
so I have to take the client’s ideas and

88
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,099
turn them into a finished product.

89
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:34,139
Most of my time is spent experimenting with
different designs and ideas and seeing what

90
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:42,509
looks good, because attention to detail is
important in this kind of work."

91
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,749
Can you say something like this about your
job and what you do?

92
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:53,319
Try to add details if you can.

93
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,810
Part four: saying how you feel about your
job.

94
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,759
Now, you can hopefully say something about
your job and where you work.

95
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,930
But here’s another question: do you like
your job?

96
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,669
Why or why not?

97
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:11,748
Hopefully, you enjoy your job!

98
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:14,210
How could you describe a job which you like?

99
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:21,729
Of course, you could use general adjectives
like 'good' or 'interesting', but here are

100
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:27,270
some specific adjectives you could use:

101
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:33,289
Stimulating :something which is stimulating
is exciting and gives you energy.

102
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:39,449
Satisfying: means that your job gives you
a sense of achievement.

103
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:44,960
Creative: you can use your imagination when
you work.

104
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,289
Rewarding: this means your job gives you very
positive feelings.

105
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:56,449
It’s often used to talk about jobs in which
you help other people.

106
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:01,669
For example, teachers or nurses might describe
their jobs as rewarding.

107
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:07,639
Challenging: challenging can be positive or
negative, but if you use it to talk about

108
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:10,699
your job, it would have a positive meaning.

109
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:15,249
It means that your job is difficult, but in
an interesting way which makes you think and

110
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:17,639
learn.

111
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,009
What if you don’t like your job?

112
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:27,250
Again, you can use general words like 'boring'
or 'difficult', which are fine but very basic.

113
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,460
If you want to be more creative with your
vocabulary, here are some things you could

114
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,900
say:

115
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:40,628
Exhausting: describes work which makes you
feel very tired, either physically or mentally.

116
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:48,899
Thankless:if your work is thankless, no one
notices or appreciates what you do.

117
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:52,680
Mind-numbing: extremely boring.

118
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,929
Dead-end: describes a job which has no prospects
for the future.

119
00:07:56,929 --> 00:08:01,818
If you have a dead-end job, you will never
get promoted and the job will always be the

120
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:03,639
same.

121
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:09,710
Soul-destroying: describes a job which is
extremely unpleasant and boring, and which

122
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,090
you really, really hate.

123
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,669
Part five: how to make a longer answer.

124
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:24,369
At this point, you should be able to introduce
your work, say where you work, give details

125
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:28,680
about what you do and say how you feel about
your work.

126
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,630
Let’s make some longer sample answers together.

127
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,229
First one:

128
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:37,490
"I’m a pharmacist.

129
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,719
I started my own small pharmacy, so I’m
also a business owner.

130
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,410
I have to work as a pharmacist, of course,
giving advice to patients and making sure

131
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,509
they have the right medicine.

132
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:58,670
However, I’m also responsible for the pharmacy,
so I have to manage my staff, do the accounts,

133
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,800
and so on.

134
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,130
It’s stimulating work because I have to
do many different things every day, so I never

135
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,000
get bored."

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,710
Clear?

137
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,860
Could you make an answer like this?

138
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,339
Let’s do one more:

139
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,270
"I’m a writer.

140
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,610
I work in online education.

141
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,449
I work for a big publishing company, which
produces different educational materials that

142
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:27,560
are used all around the world.

143
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,640
I have to write lesson plans and materials
for teachers to use in the classroom.

144
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:39,920
I spend most of my time thinking about how
I can make different things fit together into

145
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
a lesson.

146
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,650
It’s very challenging work and it can be
exhausting, but it’s also very creative

147
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:52,470
and satisfying, because I know people all
around the world are using lessons which I

148
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,529
wrote."

149
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,839
Okay, now it’s your turn!

150
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,959
Try to make a longer answer like this talking
about your job.

151
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:04,180
Use the vocabulary and structure from this
lesson to help you.

152
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,300
If you want, you can post your answer in the
video comments on YouTube.

153
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,449
We’ll give you some feedback on your answer.

154
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:16,209
That’s the end of the lesson.

155
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:20,420
I hope you learned some new ways to talk about
your job and what you do.

156
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,990
Thanks very much for watching.

157
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,749
See you next time!
