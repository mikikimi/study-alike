00:00:01,449 --> 00:00:02,860
Hi, I'm Sam.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,250
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,540
In this lesson, you can learn to talk about
your studies in English.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,258
Are you a student?

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,850
Do you study at school or university?

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:26,930
If you’ve finished your studies, can you
describe what you studied, when and where?

7
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:36,360
Talking about your studies could help you
in conversation, in an exam such as IELTS

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:43,400
or in a job interview, so it’s good to be
able to talk clearly about your studies in

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,710
English.

10
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,800
Let's start with the basics.

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,709
Look at a simple sentence:

12
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,300
I’m a student.

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,099
I study at __________.

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,030
What could you put in the gap?

15
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,299
You could say:

16
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,119
I study at high school.

17
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,799
I study at university.

18
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,570
I study at vocational college.

19
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,750
What’s vocational college?

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:26,319
It’s a kind of college where you can learn
practical skills to get one specific kind

21
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,720
of job.

22
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:37,759
For example, you can study hairdressing, plumbing,
or cookery at vocational college.

23
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,009
You can also put the place before the word
student, like this:

24
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:47,909
I’m a high school student.

25
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,099
I’m a university student.

26
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:56,549
I’m a vocational college student.

27
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,310
Of course, you can also say:

28
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,959
I’m an English student!

29
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:05,149
What else could you say here?

30
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:08,380
You could also add what year you’re in.

31
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,500
Look at some incomplete sentences:

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,090
I’m in __________ of high school.

33
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,930
I’m a __________ university student.

34
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:25,790
How could you complete these sentences?

35
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,670
You could say:

36
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,649
I’m in year 11 of high school.

37
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,900
I’m a first-year university student.

38
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:44,120
For school, we normally talk about year 1,
year 2, year 3, etc.

39
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,840
Because different countries have different
school systems, different numbers can have

40
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,569
different meanings in different places.

41
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:57,530
In American English, say grade instead of
year.

42
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:04,799
In the UK, year 1 is for children who are
4-5 years old, and the school system finishes

43
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:11,239
with year 13, when students are 17-18 years
old.

44
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:18,220
For university, you can say first year, second
year, third year and final year.

45
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,799
For example:

46
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,569
I’m in my final year.

47
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,619
I’ll graduate in June.

48
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,620
It’s my second year.

49
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,670
I’ve got two more years to go.

50
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,488
What about you?

51
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:40,950
If you’re a student now, can you make a
sentence to say where you study, and what

52
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,640
year you’re in?

53
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,358
Pause the video.

54
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,930
and practice!

55
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:54,810
Next, let’s see how you can talk about what
you study.

56
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:01,909
Again, let’s start with a simple sentence:

57
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:06,578
I’m studying for __________.

58
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:11,659
What could you say here?

59
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,780
Look at some examples:

60
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:24,420
I’m studying for an International Baccalaureate.
I’m studying for a bachelor’s in economics.

61
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:29,510
I’m studying for an MA in English literature.

62
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:38,500
Instead of I’m studying for…, you can
also say I’m doing…, like this:

63
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,310
I’m doing a PhD in cryptography.

64
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,760
I’m doing an FCE course.

65
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:54,780
If you’re taking a professional certification,
you can also say I’m studying to become…

66
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,359
For example:

67
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,200
I’m studying to become a cardiology nurse.

68
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,289
I’m studying to become an accountant.

69
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,350
What about you?

70
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,730
What are you studying?

71
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,640
Pause the video and make a sentence!

72
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,810
Okay, you can say a couple of basic things
now.

73
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:31,110
Let’s see how you can make your answer
more detailed.

74
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,120
Look at some of the sentences we saw in part
two:

75
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,190
I’m studying for an International Baccalaureate.

76
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,420
I’m doing an FCE course.

77
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:51,120
I’m studying to become an accountant.

78
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,900
Our job is to add one more sentence to each
example, giving more details.

79
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,650
To help you do this, think about these questions:

80
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:09,070
What do you have to do for this course?

81
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:13,780
Why are you doing this course?

82
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:19,590
What do you hope to get at the end of this
course?

83
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,150
Can you think of a way to make our examples
more detailed?

84
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,810
Pause if you want to think about it.

85
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,850
Let’s do some examples together:

86
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,500
I’m studying for an International Baccalaureate.

87
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:45,460
That means I’m doing English language and
literature, maths, history and philosophy.

88
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,210
I’m doing an FCE course.

89
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:55,390
I wanted to improve my English because I’d
like to work in Australia or New Zealand in

90
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,229
the future.

91
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,750
I’m studying to become an accountant.

92
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:09,580
I’m hoping to get my CPA qualification so
I can start working.

93
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,590
What about you?

94
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,840
Think about our questions again:

95
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:20,099
Can you answer these questions to make your
speaking more detailed?

96
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:28,520
Pause the video, and try to say as much as
you can about your studies, using the three

97
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,010
questions to help you.

98
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:40,849
Hopefully, now you can talk about where and
what you study and give some details.

99
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:48,900
But what do you think of your studies?

100
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:55,400
How could you describe your course or whatever
you’re studying now?

101
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,440
Do you like what you’re studying?

102
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,390
Why or why not?

103
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:06,740
To help you, think about these ideas.

104
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,180
Is what you’re studying interesting or boring?

105
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,110
Why?

106
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,520
Is it difficult or easy?

107
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,479
Again, try to explain why!

108
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,110
Let’s do some examples together:

109
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,150
I’m studying for an International Baccalaureate.

110
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:34,720
I like it but it’s hard work, because we
have to do five different subjects and there’s

111
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:41,080
a lot of work for each one, so I don’t have
much free time.

112
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,710
I’m doing an FCE course.

113
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:50,800
It’s quite interesting because I have to
use my English in new ways, and having the

114
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,530
exam to prepare for gives me the motivation
to study more than I would otherwise.

115
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:02,319
I’m studying to become an accountant.

116
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,750
To be honest it’s very easy and I find it
quite boring.

117
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:14,170
I can already do everything—I just need
the qualification!

118
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,500
Do you think you could make an answer like
this?

119
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,990
Here’s a basic template you can use:

120
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,570
I’m studying __________.

121
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,220
I find it __________, because __________.

122
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:36,690
Let’s do one more example, so you can see
how to use this template:

123
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,830
I’m studying engineering.

124
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:46,650
I find it quite hard, because there’s a
lot of maths and things you have to remember.

125
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,400
See?

126
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,140
Easy!

127
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:59,040
Now pause the video and make your own answer.

128
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,449
At this point, you should be able to talk
about what you study, give details about your

129
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:11,520
course or subjects, and give your opinion
about what you’re studying.

130
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,579
Now, let’s put everything together and make
a longer answer.

131
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:24,279
Just use the sentences you’ve practised
in the previous sections, like this:

132
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:28,120
I’m in my last year of high school.

133
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,270
I’m studying for an International Baccalaureate.

134
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:42,949
That means I’m doing English language and
literature, maths, history and philosophy.

135
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:49,990
I like it but it’s hard work, because we
have to do five different subjects and there’s

136
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:55,030
a lot of work for each one, so I don’t have
much free time.

137
00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:02,300
That’s an answer only using examples you’ve
already seen in this video.

138
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:08,060
Let’s do another longer answer with original
examples:

139
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,339
I’m a second-year university student.

140
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:18,090
I’m studying psychology, because I’ve
always been interested in how people think,

141
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:23,500
and I’m hoping to work as a psychologist
in the future.

142
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:30,390
I’m really enjoying it and I find it quite
easy, because everything’s so interesting

143
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,850
that it doesn’t feel like work!

144
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,070
Now, what about you?

145
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:42,310
Can you make a longer answer like this?

146
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:51,209
It should be easy: just put together the example
sentences you made at the end of each section!

147
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,320
If you want, put your answers in the YouTube
comments and we’ll give you feedback on

148
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,480
your English.

149
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,340
That's the end of the lesson. I hope you learned something new.

150
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:11,300
