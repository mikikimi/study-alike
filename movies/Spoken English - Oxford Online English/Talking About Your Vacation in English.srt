00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,520
Hi, I'm Gina.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,620
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:13,579
In this lesson, you can learn how to talk
about your vacation in English.

4
00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:17,480
Where did you go for your last holiday?

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,539
What did you do there?

6
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:22,420
Did you have a good time?

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:28,600
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to answer
these questions and more in clear, natural

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,820
English.

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:36,590
Did you notice how Jack says 'holiday', but
I said 'vacation'?

10
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,520
This is a difference between British and American
English.

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,360
Both words have the same meaning.

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:52,700
Let's start with some simple language you
can use to start your answer.

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:59,690
Begin your answer by saying where you went,
who with and how long for.

14
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,599
For example:

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,470
I went to the countryside with my family for
a couple of weeks.

16
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:12,060
I went to Thailand with a group of friends
for ten days.

17
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,860
My girlfriend and I went to Rome for a long
weekend.

18
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:28,560
A long weekend means you go for three or four
days, usually Friday-Monday or Saturday-Monday,

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,740
maybe because there’s a public holiday on
the Monday.

20
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,630
What about you?

21
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,580
Where did you go for your last vacation?

22
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,670
Who did you go with, and how long for?

23
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,070
Pause the video and make your own sentence.

24
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:54,350
If you want extra practice, write your sentence
down.

25
00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:02,020
If you really want extra practice, write down
three different sentences!

26
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,320
Okay?

27
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,579
Next, let’s see how you can talk about what
you did on your holiday.

28
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,700
What do you like doing on holiday?

29
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:20,920
Do you prefer a more active holiday, maybe
with lots of adventure sports and activities,

30
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,779
or would you rather do something more cultural?

31
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:30,590
Or, maybe you just like relaxing on the beach.

32
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:36,139
Whatever you prefer, it’s good if you can
say something about how you spent your time

33
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:37,749
on holiday.

34
00:02:37,749 --> 00:02:45,489
Let’s look at some examples and some good
vocabulary for you to use:

35
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:50,370
I went to the countryside with my family for
a couple of weeks.

36
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,980
Mostly, we went hiking in the hills and mountains
nearby.

37
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:03,488
We also just hung out in the village, playing
cards and eating.

38
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:06,209
Do you like hiking?

39
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:13,840
Hiking means going for longer walks, often
in the hills or the mountains.

40
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,319
If you hang out, you spend time without having
any particular goal.

41
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:28,599
If you say we just hung out in the village,
you mean that you spent time there in a relaxed

42
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,780
way.

43
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,510
Let’s look at our second example:

44
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,059
I went to Thailand with a group of friends
for ten days.

45
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:44,920
We did some sightseeing in Bangkok: the Grand
Palace, Wat Pho and so on.

46
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:53,589
Then we hit the beaches in Krabi for some
sun, swimming and cocktails!

47
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,139
Sightseeing means visiting the famous places
in a city.

48
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:03,670
You can go sightseeing or do sightseeing.

49
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:10,918
For example, if you go sightseeing in Paris,
you’d probably visit the Eiffel Tower, the

50
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,909
Louvre, Notre Dame and so on.

51
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:23,870
Saying we hit the beaches is a very informal
way of saying we went to the beaches.

52
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:29,870
You could also say we hit the bars or we hit
the clubs.

53
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,890
Using hit suggests you’re going somewhere
to party and have a good time, so you probably

54
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,659
wouldn’t use it with other places.

55
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,640
Let’s do one more example together:

56
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,159
My boyfriend and I went to Rome for a long
weekend.

57
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:52,879
We went on a walking tour of the centre and
the Vatican.

58
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:59,169
Mostly, we went to restaurants and cafes and
sampled as much of the local cuisine as we

59
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:04,008
could fit in our stomachs!

60
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:11,050
If you go on a tour, for example a walking
tour, you pay for a guide.

61
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,580
Often, tours are in big groups.

62
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:26,130
Do you prefer to go on a tour with a guide,
or do you like to explore by yourself?

63
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,710
Sample means to try many different things.

64
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:36,210
We sampled as much of the local cuisine as
we could means that we tried many different

65
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,900
dishes.

66
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,520
Alright, over to you!

67
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,520
What did you do on your last holiday?

68
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:51,289
Did you go hiking in the mountains, go sightseeing,
or sample lots of delicious food?

69
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:54,870
Try to make two or three sentences.

70
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,020
Use the language from this section if you
can.

71
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:03,320
Pause the video now and make your answer.

72
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:09,800
Next, let’s see how you can describe the
place you visited in more detail.

73
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:22,820
Can you think of three adjectives to describe
where you went for your last vacation?

74
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:30,310
Here, try to avoid general adjectives like
nice or good.

75
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,580
Try to find specific adjectives.

76
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,380
Your answer will be more interesting!

77
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,650
Let’s look at an example:

78
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:46,698
I went to the countryside with my family for
a couple of weeks.

79
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:55,449
We stayed in a very nice village surrounded
by nice mountain scenery.

80
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:58,139
Do you see what we mean?

81
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,490
Saying nice doesn’t say much.

82
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,499
This isn’t a very good example.

83
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,700
How could you make it better?

84
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,780
Here’s one way to improve it:

85
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:16,240
I went to the countryside with my family for
a couple of weeks.

86
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,650
We stayed in a very picturesque, sleepy village
surrounded by some dramatic mountain scenery.

87
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,549
What do you think dramatic scenery means?

88
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:34,300
It means the mountains were very impressive
and beautiful.

89
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,509
Picturesque is another way to say ‘beautiful’.

90
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:42,289
If something is picturesque, it’s beautiful
like a painting.

91
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:48,770
So you can use picturesque to talk about scenery
and places.

92
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:54,270
Sleepy means that the village was very quiet
and peaceful.

93
00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:01,810
You can see that using more specific adjectives
like picturesque, sleepy or dramatic makes

94
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:06,419
your answer more interesting and expressive.

95
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:11,760
Of course, you’ll need different language
to talk about different places.

96
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,969
Let’s look at another example:

97
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,789
I went to Thailand with a group of friends
for ten days.

98
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:28,650
Bangkok is a very cosmopolitan place but it
could be a little overwhelming because there

99
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,179
was so much going on!

100
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:38,950
Then we went to Krabi, which has some stunning
beaches.

101
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:44,690
Do you know the meaning of the key words in
this answer?

102
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:54,000
Cosmopolitan describes a city which has many
different people and cultures mixed together.

103
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,730
Overwhelming describes something which is
very intense.

104
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:06,690
For example, a city can be overwhelming if
there are lots of people, noises, sights and

105
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,020
smells all around you.

106
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:16,770
There’s so much to take in that you don’t
know where to look!

107
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:20,120
Stunning means ‘very beautiful’.

108
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,540
Let’s do one more example together:

109
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,230
My girlfriend and I went to Rome for a long
weekend.

110
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:33,410
It’s a fascinating place but it’s quite
touristy, too.

111
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,530
The best thing was the food, which was out
of this world.

112
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:46,689
Here, we used the adjectives fascinating,
touristy and out of this world.

113
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,520
Could you explain what these mean?

114
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,439
Fascinating means ‘very interesting’.

115
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:01,310
Touristy describes a place where tourism has
grown too much.

116
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:07,020
Often, if you describe a place as touristy,
you mean that it’s lost some of its original

117
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,240
atmosphere.

118
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,360
Finally, if you describe something as out
of this world, you mean it’s really good

119
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,500
and you enjoyed it very much.

120
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,560
Now, it’s your turn.

121
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,819
Can you describe the place you visited on
your last vacation?

122
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:33,470
You can use the adjectives and language from
this section, or you can find your own words

123
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,850
and phrases.

124
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:42,070
Try to use at least three interesting adjectives
in your answer.

125
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:51,580
Pause the video and do it now, either speaking
or writing.

126
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,120
How was that?

127
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,020
Remember that you can always review a section
if you found something difficult.

128
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:07,199
Next, how can you talk about what you liked
or disliked on your vacation?

129
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,240
What’s the best vacation you’ve ever had?

130
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,250
What about the worst vacation you’ve ever
been on?

131
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,700
What made these holidays so good or so bad?

132
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:28,360
Let’s see how you can talk about the positives
and negatives of your holiday.

133
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,390
Here’s our first example:

134
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,880
I went to the countryside with my family for
a couple of weeks.

135
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,830
It was relaxing but by the end I was getting
quite bored.

136
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:48,070
This is good, but it’s always better to
add a reason if you can:

137
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:52,450
I went to the countryside with my family for
a couple of weeks.

138
00:11:52,450 --> 00:12:00,120
It was relaxing but by the end I was getting
quite bored, because each day was pretty similar.

139
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,700
What does that mean, each day was pretty similar?

140
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,880
Do you know?

141
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,920
It means that you did the same kind of things
each day, so there wasn’t much variety from

142
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,410
one day to the next.

143
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:19,890
Let’s look at our next example:

144
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:24,449
I went to Thailand with a group of friends
for ten days.

145
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:31,220
I loved Krabi, because it was like nowhere
I’d ever been before.

146
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,350
I wasn’t so keen on Bangkok.

147
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:42,260
It’s a cool place but it’s a bit big and
noisy for my tastes.

148
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:48,420
Saying it was like nowhere I’d ever been
before means that the place you went to was

149
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,099
really unique.

150
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:57,530
You can use I wasn’t so keen on… to talk
about something you didn’t like very much

151
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,699
in the past.

152
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,450
For example:

153
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,820
I wasn’t so keen on the food in the hotel.

154
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:13,030
I wasn’t so keen on the museums—I didn’t
think they were very interesting.

155
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:21,569
Adding for my tastes after you give your opinion
shows that this is just your perspective.

156
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:28,310
You would use it after you give a negative
opinion, to soften your idea slightly.

157
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,660
For example:

158
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:37,060
It’s a nice area, but it’s too developed
and touristy for my tastes.

159
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:44,400
Adding for my tastes makes this sound slightly
softer and less direct.

160
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:50,780
Okay, let’s do one more example together:

161
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:55,060
My girlfriend and I went to Rome for a long
weekend.

162
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,800
I think I liked the general atmosphere most
of all.

163
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,240
Walking around the little streets in the centre
felt like being in an old film.

164
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,140
I wish it had been less crowded, though.

165
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:16,490
Here, you can use the phrase I liked … most
of all to talk about your favourite thing

166
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,940
from your vacation.

167
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:27,790
Use I wish plus the past perfect (had done)
to talk about something in the past which

168
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,599
you would change if you could.

169
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,310
For example:

170
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,939
I wish we’d had more time to explore the
city.

171
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,390
I wish we hadn’t stayed in that awful hotel.

172
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,910
Okay, your turn again!

173
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:50,350
What did you like and dislike about your last
holiday?

174
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:55,450
Make at least two or three sentences, and
say them out loud.

175
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:00,840
Remember to give reasons to support your ideas.

176
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:11,010
Now, you should be ready to put everything
together into a longer answer.

177
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,700
To make a longer answer, you need to:

178
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,990
Say where you went, who with, and for how
long.

179
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,700
Say what you did.

180
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,940
Describe the place.

181
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:29,260
Talk about what you liked and disliked.

182
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:35,980
Let’s do an example using language from
the lesson:

183
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,660
I went to Thailand with a group of friends
for ten days.

184
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:48,560
We did some sightseeing in Bangkok: the Grand
Palace, Wat Pho and so on.

185
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:56,030
Then we hit the beaches in Krabi for some
sun, swimming and cocktails!

186
00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:03,069
Bangkok is a very cosmopolitan place but it
could be a little overwhelming because there

187
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,410
was so much going on!

188
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:13,189
Krabi has some stunning beaches, and I loved
it there, because it was like nowhere I’d

189
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,820
ever been before.

190
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,620
On the other hand, I wasn’t so keen on Bangkok.

191
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,680
It’s a cool place but it’s a bit big and
noisy for my tastes.

192
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:38,140
Do you see how using simple phrases and ideas,
you can build a full, clear, detailed answer?

193
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:46,000
We’ve added some linking words, but otherwise
this is only using language you’ve seen

194
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,410
in this lesson.

195
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,939
Let’s do one more example.

196
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,650
This time, we’ll use original ideas:

197
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,990
I went to Siberia by myself for three weeks.

198
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:06,400
I travelled around, did some hiking and camping,
and explored the countryside.

199
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:13,880
I was near Lake Baikal, which is a huge lake
with mountains and villages dotted around

200
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
the sides.

201
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:23,800
It was beautiful in a wild way, and the emptiness
gave me a real feeling of isolation and solitude.

202
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,300
I liked the people I met—everyone was so
open and welcoming.

203
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:34,649
On the other hand, even though it was summer,
the nights were so cold!

204
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,090
I wish I’d taken a warmer sleeping bag.

205
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:44,040
This time, I’m using different ideas and
some different language, but I’m still following

206
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
the same structure.

207
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:52,260
Now, can you make a longer answer like these?

208
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,260
Try it!

209
00:17:53,260 --> 00:18:00,670
If it’s difficult, review the video or use
a dictionary to get the vocabulary you need.

210
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:07,750
Practise your answer several times, until
you can do it fluently and comfortably.

211
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:14,650
You could also talk about other vacations
you had, not just the last one.

212
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,500
If you want feedback on your answer, put it
in the comments.

213
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,480
We’ll give you feedback and show you how
you can improve.

214
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,440
