00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:05,880
Hi, I'm Gina, welcome to Oxford Online English.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:12,149
In this lesson you can learn how to sound
more confident when you speak English.

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:19,710
When we ask students, “Why do you want to
learn English,” often people don’t talk

4
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,830
about their language skills.

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,930
They talk about their feelings.

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:33,140
They say things like:
“I don’t feel confident when I’m speaking

7
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,140
English.”

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,100
“I’m afraid my English sounds bad.”

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,170
“I want to feel better about my English.”

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,760
Does this sound like you?

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:53,019
In this lesson, you can learn some simple,
effective tips to sound more confident speaking

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,020
English.

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,820
We’ll show you ideas that anyone can use.

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,560
We have a saying in English: “Fake it till
you make it.”

15
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,690
Have you heard it?

16
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,620
If not, can you guess what it means?

17
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:19,030
It means that confidence starts on the outside.

18
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:25,970
You need to act confident and sound confident,
even if you don’t feel confident.

19
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:31,490
So, if you lack confidence when you speak
English, you have to ‘fake it’.

20
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:38,110
You have to act confident, even though you
don’t feel confident.

21
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:47,140
This is important to understand: there isn’t
some sort of magical switch you can flip and

22
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,000
suddenly feel confident.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,950
Feeling more confident is a journey which
will take time and work.

24
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:05,660
Remember: to improve your English confidence,
you need to accept that you might not feel

25
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,310
confident right away.

26
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,530
That’s okay!

27
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:17,609
The first steps towards confidence in your
spoken English are on the outside.

28
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:26,010
So, what can you actually do?

29
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,670
When you’re not confident in your English,
you’ll probably do three things:

30
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,859
One: you’ll speak too quietly.

31
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,800
Two: you’ll try to speak too fast.

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:50,630
Three: you’ll speak in fragments, using
single words and phrases instead of full sentences.

33
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,280
For example:

34
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,560
"Martin, did you have a good weekend?"

35
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,069
"Not bad.

36
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:00,399
Just stayed at home."

37
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,739
Did that sound, or look, confident?

38
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:07,310
Not really!

39
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,090
Let’s try again.

40
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,639
"Hey Martin, did you have a good weekend?"

41
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,029
"It was kind of boring, actually!

42
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:18,950
I didn’t go anywhere or do anything.

43
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,760
What about you?"

44
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,760
See the difference?

45
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,730
Even though I still had a boring weekend and
didn’t have anything interesting to say,

46
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,760
I was still able to sound confident and comfortable.

47
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:44,370
There are three things you can do here, but
before you start, I’d like you to do something:

48
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,719
record yourself talking in English for one
minute.

49
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,168
Introduce yourself and talk a little about
your life.

50
00:03:53,169 --> 00:04:00,620
Go on, pause the video and do it now, then
come back!

51
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,639
Listen to the recording.

52
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:06,659
How does it sound?

53
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,679
Do you sound confident?

54
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,530
Next, let’s get back to what you can do
to sound more confident in English.

55
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:21,168
First, control the volume of your voice.

56
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:25,419
Confident people speak at a high, clear volume.

57
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:31,190
You don’t have to shout, but your voice
should be loud enough that anyone in the same

58
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,810
room could understand you clearly.

59
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:41,949
Secondly, control the speed of your voice.

60
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:47,990
When you’re nervous, it’s normal to try
to speak faster.

61
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:57,169
If you try to speak too fast, you’ll sound
less confident, and also make more mistakes.

62
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:01,680
Slowing down will help you in many ways.

63
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:09,850
You’ll sound more confident, you’ll be
easier to understand when you speak English,

64
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,889
and you’ll make fewer mistakes.

65
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:18,800
Finally, speak in full sentences.

66
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,139
If you’re not confident in your spoken English,
you’ll try to say as little as possible.

67
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:32,009
To sound confident, you should show that you’re
not scared of speaking English.

68
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:34,150
So, use full sentences.

69
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,388
Now it’s time to make another recording.

70
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:41,030
Even better, make three recordings.

71
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:45,349
Each should be around one minute.

72
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:49,259
Talk about yourself and your life, like you
did before.

73
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,270
The first time, focus on the volume of your
voice.

74
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,438
Try to speak loudly and clearly.

75
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:03,909
The second time, focus on speed.

76
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:10,520
Try to slow down and speak at a clear, controlled
pace.

77
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:17,210
The third time, focus on speaking in full
sentences.

78
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,388
Listen to the recordings.

79
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:23,330
Compare them to the first recording you made.

80
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,639
Do they sound better?

81
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,240
Next, try to use these points when you talk
English in real life.

82
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:39,830
Remember, you might not feel confident, but
you will sound more confident.

83
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:46,169
If you sound more confident, people will respond
to you differently.

84
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:54,318
Try it—you might be surprised how much difference
these simple points make!

85
00:06:54,320 --> 00:07:00,770
When you see how people respond to you, you’ll
feel more confident in your English.

86
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,659
Do you ever say things like this?

87
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:09,319
“Sorry about my English.”

88
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,319
“Sorry.

89
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,520
I know my English is really bad.”

90
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,240
Here’s a question: why?

91
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,060
No, seriously, why say these things?

92
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,050
What’s the point?

93
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:32,240
When you say things like this, you get two
results:

94
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,669
One: you reinforce your negative feelings
by expressing them.

95
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:45,349
Two: you show the person you’re talking
to that you don’t believe in yourself.

96
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:51,190
And, if you don’t believe in yourself, why
should anyone else?

97
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,919
Neither of these is a good result.

98
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:58,120
So, what’s the solution?

99
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:06,630
Very simple: stop apologising for your English!

100
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,590
It’s a waste of time.

101
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,008
First of all, if you’re talking to me, and
your English is really bad, I can see that

102
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:14,009
already.

103
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:15,740
I don’t need you to tell me.

104
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:22,710
More importantly, most people won’t judge
you for your English.

105
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:28,198
Most people in the world aren’t interested
in your English at all.

106
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:36,159
If someone’s talking to you, they’re talking
to you to be friendly, or because they want

107
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,539
something from you, or because they’re interested
in your ideas.

108
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:45,110
They’re not talking to you to see how good
your English is.

109
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:53,089
And even if the person you’re talking to
is judging your English, what can you do about

110
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,700
it at that moment?

111
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,430
Nothing at all.

112
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,388
So, why apologise?

113
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:02,320
Why feel bad?

114
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,130
It doesn’t help.

115
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:10,250
Okay, maybe you can’t help feeling bad,
though you shouldn’t.

116
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,470
But, you can control what you say.

117
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,890
Don’t apologise for your English.

118
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,780
Never apologise for your English.

119
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:26,730
Here’s something about me.

120
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:32,860
I don’t speak Tamil, or Slovenian, or Xhosa.

121
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,860
Not one word!

122
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,680
Should I feel bad about that?

123
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:45,599
Should I apologise, and say, “Hey, I’m
really sorry about my bad Tamil, and my bad

124
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Slovenian.

125
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,290
Oh, and my terrible Xhosa, sorry about that,
too.

126
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:58,110
And sorry about my Navajo, and my Finnish,
and my Korean, and…”

127
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,779
Okay, Martin, okay.

128
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:03,220
We get it.

129
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:09,120
Hopefully, you see how unnecessary it is now.

130
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,640
Even if your English is bad, so what?

131
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,430
Don’t be sorry; go get better instead.

132
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:25,199
Never apologise for your English!

133
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,400
I want you to do something for me.

134
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:36,420
Pause the video and write down three situations
where you would feel nervous about speaking

135
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,819
English.

136
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,560
Have you got three situations?

137
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,770
What are they?

138
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:50,610
Maybe you wrote something like this:

139
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,570
Talking to a native speaker.

140
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,660
Making a speech in front of my class.

141
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,730
Making a presentation at work.

142
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:09,600
Now, for each of your three situations, I
want you to create three different levels:

143
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,920
easy, medium and hard.

144
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,060
What do we mean here?

145
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,630
Let’s take the example of talking to a native
speaker.

146
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:28,820
Many English learners have told us that they
feel nervous talking to native English speakers.

147
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:37,220
So, we need three different levels of this
situation: easy, medium, and hard.

148
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,089
Here’s a suggestion:

149
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:45,370
Easy: say ‘hello’ to a native speaker.

150
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:54,459
Medium: introduce yourself to a native speaker
and ask 1-2 questions.

151
00:11:54,459 --> 00:12:00,959
Hard: have a 5-minute conversation with a
native speaker.

152
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,729
Okay, so what now?

153
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,579
Go out and do them, of course!

154
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:09,770
Start with the easy challenge.

155
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,860
Repeat it several times, if you want.

156
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,529
Then, go to the medium challenge.

157
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:20,610
Again, you can do it more than once.

158
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,810
Finally, try the hard challenge.

159
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,849
Of course, this isn’t something you can
just do.

160
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,339
This might take you days or weeks.

161
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:40,870
Also, the exact challenges you set yourself
will depend on your English level and your

162
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,440
situation.

163
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,990
The key points: the easy challenge should
be really easy—something that’s not a

164
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,610
challenge for you at all.

165
00:12:51,610 --> 00:13:02,100
The medium challenge should make you think,
“That’s difficult, but I can do it.”

166
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:09,020
The hard challenge should make you think,
“Can I really do this?”

167
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,069
Let’s do another example.

168
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:17,670
Let’s take the idea of making a presentation
at work.

169
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,920
We need three challenges:

170
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:27,260
Easy challenge: ask a question or make a point
in a meeting.

171
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:34,259
Medium challenge: make a short presentation
to a small group.

172
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:42,500
Hard challenge: volunteer to make a longer
presentation to a big group.

173
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,100
Again, these are just examples.

174
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:54,290
You should think carefully about your challenges,
because they should be personal to you.

175
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,510
So, let’s review.

176
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:02,399
You have three situations which make you feel
unconfident.

177
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:09,649
For each situation, you should have three
challenges: easy, medium and hard.

178
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:16,930
Make a list of your challenges and put it
somewhere in your home.

179
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:24,620
When you complete a challenge and you think
you did it well, cross it off your list.

180
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,839
Imagine crossing off your first hard challenge.

181
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,389
Think about that feeling.

182
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:33,069
Wouldn’t it feel good?

183
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:41,420
Wouldn’t it feel good to know you did something
you thought was too difficult for you?

184
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,279
You’re not there yet.

185
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,300
You should start small and build up gradually.

186
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,520
Remember, this isn’t a quick fix.

187
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,500
This might take weeks, or even months.

188
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:04,740
When you finish your first nine challenges,
set yourself nine more.

189
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,540
Start again.

190
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,569
You might not be able to do every challenge.

191
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,630
You know what?

192
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,959
It doesn’t matter.

193
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:20,018
You’ll be doing something and taking action,
which will help you to build confidence in

194
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:25,640
your spoken English.

195
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,640
Let’s look at one more practical tip.

196
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:39,230
Writing about your thoughts and feelings in
a diary or journal can be very helpful.

197
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:46,449
First, imagine a situation: you have a group
of English-speaking colleagues.

198
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:49,439
They’re all friends with each other.

199
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,660
You never talk to them.

200
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:57,000
You just talk to your other colleagues in
your language.

201
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,089
You want to talk to your English-speaking
colleagues, but you don’t feel confident

202
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:03,480
enough.

203
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:13,220
At this point, take out your journal and write
down all the worst things that could happen.

204
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:19,839
Take your biggest fears about the situation
and put them into a list.

205
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,699
For example:

206
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:24,229
They’ll laugh at me.

207
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:29,810
They won’t be interested in what I have
to say.

208
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:35,099
I won’t be able to say one word in English
when I speak to them.

209
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,110
I’ll feel stupid and useless.

210
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,290
What next?

211
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,410
Go and talk to them, of course!

212
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:49,360
If you want, you can make a challenge ladder,
like we did in part four.

213
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:57,000
Set yourself easy, medium and hard challenges,
and work through them.

214
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:06,030
After you talk to them, next to your list
of fears, write down what actually happened

215
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,609
when you spoke to them.

216
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:20,089
For example:

217
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:24,448
Of course, it’s not certain that everything
will go well.

218
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:28,900
Maybe sometimes your fears will come true.

219
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:37,950
But, you’ll find that most of the time,
the things you’re afraid of don’t happen.

220
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:44,510
By writing things down like this, you’ll
be able to see how your fears are just in

221
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,510
your head.

222
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:52,350
You’ll see that reality is often a lot more
optimistic than you are!

223
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:58,300
Writing down your feelings like this will
help you to understand that other people aren’t

224
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,379
judging you and your English.

225
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:08,020
This way, you can feel more free and confident
when you speak English!

226
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:13,780
Do you have any other advice to help people
feel more confident speaking English?

227
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,840
Let us know in the comments!

228
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,668
Thanks for watching!

229
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:21,340
See you next time!
