00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:03,300
Hello, I’m Mia.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,089
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,900
In this lesson, you can learn how to use auxiliary
verbs for emphasis.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,420
"I like chocolate;" "I do like chocolate."

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,950
Do you know the difference between these two
sentences?

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:26,340
In the second sentence--"I do like chocolate"--we
use the auxiliary verb 'do' to add emphasis.

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,040
Emphasis means making your idea stronger or
clearer.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,080
Would you like to learn how to do this?

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,640
In this lesson, you will learn how to use
auxiliary verbs (like 'do' or 'will') to add

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,100
emphasis to the things you say in English.

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,050
Part one: using auxiliaries for emphasis.

12
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:54,328
Look at the following examples:
"I like going swimming."

13
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:57,100
"I do like going swimming."

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,410
The first example tells us that you like swimming.

15
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:08,200
In the second example, it stresses that you
really like going swimming, it is emphasised.

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:16,729
If we want to emphasise something in English,
we can use auxiliary verbs to do this.

17
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:21,520
Here’s another example:
"Did you phone Jack?"

18
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,219
"Yes, I phoned Jack."

19
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:25,979
"Yes, I did phone Jack."

20
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,990
Can you tell the difference now?

21
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,399
When I say, “I did phone Jack,” the use
of 'did' makes the point stronger.

22
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:42,869
In this lesson, we’ll learn how and when
to use auxiliaries; don’t worry, this grammar

23
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:49,219
is very easy to learn and use—you’ll be
using it like a native in no time!

24
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:53,780
Part two: when to emphasise something.

25
00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:01,159
Okay, now let’s look at when you might use
an auxiliary verb to add emphasis.

26
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,020
We use auxiliaries for emphasis when we feel
strongly about something and want to show

27
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,020
this.

28
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:13,010
Look at the following examples:
"I am sorry."

29
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,720
"I do not like your cake."

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,019
"I would like to dance."

31
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:25,430
All of these examples tell us that you feel
very strongly about what you’re saying.

32
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:30,330
We often use auxiliaries like this to correct
what somebody else says.

33
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:37,549
Have a look at this example:
"Why don’t you like pizza?"

34
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:39,250
"But I do like pizza!"

35
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,739
The first person wrongly thinks that the second
person doesn’t like pizza.

36
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:51,250
The second person uses the auxiliary verb
with emphasis to correct their mistake.

37
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,489
Here’s another example:
"You haven’t cleaned the kitchen."

38
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:58,260
"I have cleaned the kitchen."

39
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:05,599
Again, the second person adds emphasis to
the auxiliary 'have' to correct the first

40
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,299
person’s mistake.

41
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:14,490
Another way to use auxiliary verbs is to contrast
two different ideas or things.

42
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:19,470
Have a look:
"I can’t play football, but I can play basketball."

43
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:25,989
"I didn’t have a good time at the cinema,
but I did enjoy the restaurant."

44
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:31,079
"I don’t like cakes, but I do like chocolate."

45
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:37,670
All of these examples look at two different
things and use the auxiliary (with emphasis)

46
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,170
to contrast them.

47
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,629
Part three: how to use auxiliaries.

48
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:48,939
Now that you’ve seen when you should use
auxiliaries for emphasis, let’s look at

49
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:51,459
how to use them in more detail.

50
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:58,650
If you want to emphasise something in the
present simple or past simple tenses, add

51
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:05,209
the auxiliary verbs 'do', 'does' or 'did',
without changing the main verb.

52
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:11,299
Look at these examples:
"I work;" "I do work."

53
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:14,989
"I worked;" "I did work."

54
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:21,060
It works the same way when we’re talking
about other people; for example:

55
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,540
"She cleans;" "She does clean."

56
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,280
"She tidied up;" "She did tidy up."

57
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,609
In the negative form, we would stress the
negative part of the auxiliary:

58
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,970
"She did not tidy up."

59
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,720
"I do not want to visit her."

60
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,380
Remember: it’s important not to contract
the words, as this does not have the same

61
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,380
effect!

62
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:52,290
You can’t emphasise a negative like this:
"I don’t want to talk to him."

63
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:58,570
You need to use the full form, and emphasise
the word 'not', like this:

64
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,050
"I do not want to talk to him."

65
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:08,710
Now, let’s see how to use the auxiliary
for emphasis in other verb tenses.

66
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:14,830
In other tenses, there is already an auxiliary
verb, so you don’t need to add anything.

67
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:21,969
You just need to pronounce the auxiliary verb
with stress, to show emphasis.

68
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,140
In continuous tenses, we would stress the
verb 'to be'.

69
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:32,419
Don’t use contractions if you want to emphasise
the auxiliary verb; use the full form.

70
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,260
Here are some examples:
"I am going to phone her!"

71
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,380
"He is coming tomorrow."

72
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,580
"We are running in the race!"

73
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,340
What about perfect tenses?

74
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,000
The idea is similar.

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,330
Stress the verbs 'have', 'has' or 'had' to
make your point.

76
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,180
For example:
"I have emptied the dishwasher."

77
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,530
"I had bought her a present."

78
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,500
"She has visited me."

79
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:11,430
You can do the same with any modal verb ('will',
'would', 'must', 'should', etc.)—I did tell

80
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,770
you it would be easy grammar, didn’t I?

81
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:21,950
Take a look at these examples:
"I can sing, listen!"

82
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,320
"Must you be so loud?"

83
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,500
"You cannot believe that!"

84
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,130
Part four: review.

85
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,270
Okay, let’s review:
You can use auxiliary verbs for emphasis to:

86
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:40,780
show that you feel strongly about something;
correct something wrong that someone else

87
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,179
said; contrast two different ideas.

88
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:53,830
In the present simple and past simple tenses,
you need to add an auxiliary verb ('do'/'does'/'did')

89
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,349
if you want to emphasise the idea.

90
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:03,370
With other verb tenses or modal verbs, there’s
already an auxiliary, so you just pronounce

91
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:08,780
the auxiliary with stress to add emphasis
to the idea.

92
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,450
Remember not to use contractions!

93
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:16,420
To add emphasis, you need to use the full
form.

94
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,050
That’s the end of the lesson.

95
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,300
I do appreciate your time; thanks for watching!

96
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,930
I hope that you learned something new in this
class.
