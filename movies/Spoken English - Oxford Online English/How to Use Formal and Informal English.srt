1
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:03,270
Greetings!

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:09,290
My name is Gina Mares, and I would like to
take this opportunity to welcome you to this

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,500
Oxford Online English video lesson.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,160
Hello!

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,000
My name’s Gina.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Welcome to the class.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,410
Hey guys!

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,849
Gina here.

9
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:23,460
Let’s get started!

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,810
What’s going on here?

11
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,590
Why am I welcoming you three times?

12
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:36,370
In this lesson, you can learn about formal
and informal English.

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:44,640
You’ll learn how to recognise and use formal
and informal styles in your spoken and written

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,560
English.

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,640
Look at three sentences:

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,960
Could I disturb you for a minute?

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,220
Can I ask you something?

18
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,920
You got a sec?

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,150
All of these sentences have the same basic
meaning—I want to talk to you and ask you

20
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,650
about something.

21
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,150
However, the tone is different.

22
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,280
Can you see how?

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,400
These three sentences show three levels of
formality.

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,860
The first sentence is formal; it shows politeness,
respect and distance.

25
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:35,670
The second sentence is neutral; it does not
have a formal or an informal tone.

26
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:43,740
The third sentence is informal; it shows that
you and the person you are speaking to are

27
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:52,530
familiar with each other, and you don't need
to make an effort to be polite or respectful.

28
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,820
Actually, there are more than three levels
of formality.

29
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,158
For example:

30
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,890
Might I ask you something?

31
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,229
May I take a moment of your time?

32
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:10,770
Could I disturb you for a minute?

33
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,790
These sentences are all formal.

34
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,400
The first is extremely formal.

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,090
It’s probably too formal to use in most
situations.

36
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:30,190
The other two are both formal; the second
is probably more formal than the third.

37
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,380
Why ‘probably’?

38
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,090
Formality isn’t absolute.

39
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:45,140
It also depends on context and intonation,
so it’s not just about the words you use.

40
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,769
So, there are many levels of formality.

41
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:56,770
However, when you speak or write in English,
it’s useful to think about three levels:

42
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,960
formal, neutral and informal.

43
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:10,680
But when should you use these different levels
of language?

44
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,599
In my experience, many English students use
language which is too formal.

45
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,450
They think: formal language is more polite.

46
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,679
Polite language is better.

47
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,760
Right?

48
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,060
No, not always!

49
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,599
Language which is too polite puts distance
between you and the person you’re talking

50
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,599
to.

51
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,799
At best, this will sound awkward and unnatural.

52
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:49,250
At worst, you can sound cold and unfriendly
if you use language which is too formal.

53
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:56,319
Knowing when to use formal language depends
mostly on context.

54
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:04,790
Let me ask you a question: when should you
use formal language?

55
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:12,879
Maybe you said things like: in job interviews,
in business meetings or negotiations, when

56
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,060
talking to older people, when writing business
emails, and so on.

57
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:27,080
The fact is, it’s not possible to say you
should always use formal language in these

58
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,080
situations.

59
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,710
It always depends.

60
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,620
For example, take job interviews.

61
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:41,240
Some companies have a very corporate culture,
with a strict hierarchy and lots of rules

62
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,840
and procedures.

63
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:51,060
Other companies are more relaxed, and pay
less attention to rules and job titles.

64
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:57,580
Obviously, if you’re going for a job interview
at the first kind of company, you’ll want

65
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:05,770
to dress, act and speak formally, to fit in
with the company culture.

66
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,580
On the other hand, if you go for an interview
at the second kind of company, where things

67
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:18,258
are more relaxed, it wouldn’t be appropriate
to speak very formally.

68
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:24,300
So, always think about the actual situation
in front of you.

69
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,600
If you’re not sure, try to listen to other
people around you.

70
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,250
If people around you are speaking informally
to each other, you probably shouldn’t try

71
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,479
to sound very formal.

72
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:46,409
Also, if you don’t know, then use neutral
language.

73
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,570
Neutral language is safe.

74
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,940
You can use it in any situation.

75
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:59,800
Informal language is very important in spoken
English, but you need to be careful.

76
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:07,910
Using informal language at the wrong time
could sound disrespectful or rude.

77
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:22,810
Next, let's consider some of the main differences
between formal, neutral and informal English.

78
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:29,669
Formal English tends to use longer, more complicated
sentence structures.

79
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:36,099
Informal and neutral English tend to use shorter,
simpler sentence structures.

80
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,150
For example:

81
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:44,469
I was wondering if you could make yourself
available on Wednesday to provide more detailed

82
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,160
guidance on these matters.

83
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,960
--> This is a formal sentence.

84
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,580
You can see that it’s quite long, with a
complex structure.

85
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,560
Do you have time on Wednesday to help us with
these problems?

86
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,880
--> This is neutral.

87
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,301
You got some free time on Wednesday to talk
about this?

88
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:15,318
--> This is more informal.

89
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:23,400
You can see that the neutral and informal
sentences are much shorter and simpler.

90
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,198
Let’s do one more example.

91
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,600
I’ll give you three sentences.

92
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:39,449
Can you see which one is formal, which is
neutral, and which is informal?

93
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:43,680
We should have a word with him first.

94
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:51,150
It may well be necessary to contact him before
we make a decision.

95
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:57,429
We need to talk to him before we decide.

96
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,120
Which is which?

97
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,490
The first sentence is informal.

98
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,620
The second sentence is formal.

99
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,889
The third sentence is neutral.

100
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,990
Did you get it right?

101
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:21,199
Again, you can see that the formal sentence
is longer and more complex.

102
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:29,770
Another point is that we sometimes leave out
words in informal English, especially in questions.

103
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:38,328
For example, in the question Are you sure?
it is possible to leave out the word are and

104
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:41,598
just say You sure?

105
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:49,610
In fact, you could even leave out the word
you and just ask a question with one word:

106
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,000
sure?

107
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,819
Let’s see some more examples of this:

108
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:58,089
Will you be joining us?

109
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:02,600
(Formal—full form)
Are you coming?

110
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,610
(neutral—full form)
You coming?

111
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,800
(Informal—short form)

112
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,180
Do you have any suggestions?

113
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,829
(Formal—full form)
Have you got any ideas?

114
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:24,069
(neutral—full form)
Any ideas?

115
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,630
(Informal—short form)

116
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:34,639
Do you notice any other differences between
the formal, neutral and informal sentences

117
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,019
you’ve seen in this section?

118
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:44,879
You might notice that we use different words
in formal, neutral and informal English.

119
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:52,660
Vocabulary is another important difference
between formal and informal language.

120
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,759
Let’s look!

121
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:05,540
Formal English tends to use more literary,
rare or old-fashioned vocabulary.

122
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:15,110
Generally, if you want to be formal, you need
to be very precise with your use of vocabulary.

123
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:21,350
Neutral English tends to use simpler, more
common words.

124
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:27,399
Informal English, like neutral English, uses
simple and common vocabulary.

125
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:35,730
However, informal English also includes slang,
phrasal verbs and colloquial language which

126
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:41,430
are not features of neutral English.

127
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,529
Informal English is also generally looser.

128
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:53,600
It uses more general words, and the meaning
is understood from the context.

129
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,810
Let's look at this in some more detail:

130
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:03,290
We need to verify the data before we proceed.

131
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,889
We need to check the data before we continue.

132
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:15,989
We need to check everything before we carry
on.

133
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:23,379
You can see that the formal sentence uses
more literary vocabulary: verify instead of

134
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:29,790
check, and proceed instead of continue.

135
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,949
The neutral sentence uses simple, common words.

136
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:44,359
The informal sentence is less precise: instead
of saying the data, we say everything.

137
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:53,839
It also uses a phrasal verb: carry on instead
of proceed or continue.

138
00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:00,739
In informal English, it's common to use vocabulary
in a less precise way.

139
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:09,429
For example, you might use words like stuff
or things to refer to specific things.

140
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:13,519
You wouldn’t do this if you were speaking
formally.

141
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,360
For example:

142
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:23,459
You are required to collect your belongings
and vacate the premises.

143
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:29,868
You need to take your personal possessions
and leave the building.

144
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:34,189
You need to get your stuff together and get
out.

145
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:44,209
Again, you can see more literary vocabulary
in the formal sentence (required, collect,

146
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:50,719
belongings, vacate, premises).

147
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,379
On the other hand, the informal sentence uses
more basic vocabulary, including multi-part

148
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:04,059
verbs like get…together or get out.

149
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:09,009
The informal sentence is also much less precise.

150
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:16,480
It simply refers to stuff, instead of belongings
or possessions.

151
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:25,179
It also says …get out, without specifying
the place (the premises or the building).

152
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:30,379
The neutral sentence is somewhere in between.

153
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:35,790
In neutral language, you generally choose
the simplest word you can.

154
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:46,689
So, you would say take instead of collect,
leave instead of vacate, and so on.

155
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:53,370
You can also see that the informal sentence
is much more direct than the other two.

156
00:13:53,370 --> 00:14:02,279
This is an important part of formality in
English.

157
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:06,779
Formal language tends to be much more indirect.

158
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:14,319
Formal language often sounds quite impersonal,
because it uses fewer personal pronouns like

159
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:21,679
I, you, he, she, etc.

160
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,350
Informal language tends to be more direct
and personal.

161
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:32,869
Informal language can be so direct that it
can sound aggressive or rude if you use it

162
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:36,329
in the wrong situations.

163
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:42,199
Neutral language is in the middle, similar
to other situations you’ve seen.

164
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:43,679
For example:

165
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:49,019
Lessons need to be learnt from the mistakes
which were made.

166
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:55,369
--> formal
I hope you can learn from where you went wrong.

167
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:59,299
--> neutral
You made a mess of this and you need to do

168
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:02,399
better next time.

169
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,269
--> informal

170
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:08,809
You can see that the formal sentence is impersonal.

171
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:11,550
How does it achieve this?

172
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:17,339
First, the formal sentence uses the passive.

173
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:22,620
This makes it possible to avoid using personal
pronouns.

174
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:29,220
The other two sentences include the word you,
but the formal sentence doesn’t.

175
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:38,459
This makes it possible to express the idea
without mentioning or blaming a specific person,

176
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:43,258
which can be useful in certain situations.

177
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:50,089
The neutral sentence is personal, because
it uses you to refer to the listener.

178
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:59,050
However, it’s not very direct, and wouldn’t
generally be considered rude, even in a professional

179
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,050
setting.

180
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,269
The informal sentence is very direct.

181
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:10,970
If you say this to someone, you’re not hiding
what you think!

182
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:18,709
This can be useful if you need to make yourself
clear, but it could also sound rude or aggressive.

183
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:23,239
It’s not appropriate in all situations.

184
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,920
Let’s do one more example.

185
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,238
Look at three sentences.

186
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:38,829
Can you tell which is formal, which is neutral,
and which is informal?

187
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:46,449
We won’t be able to do anything until we
deal with these issues.

188
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:53,799
We won't be able to get anywhere until you
sort this out.

189
00:16:53,799 --> 00:17:03,799
It may be difficult to make progress until
these matters are resolved.

190
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:06,790
Can you tell which is which?

191
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:15,859
The first sentence is neutral, the second
is informal, and the third sentence is formal.

192
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:21,388
You can see that the formal sentence uses
an impersonal structure (with it), rather

193
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:25,438
than a personal pronoun (we or you).

194
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:33,720
Again, this is useful if you want to be respectful
and indirect, because it isn’t clearly directed

195
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,100
at one person.

196
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,750
The neutral sentence is more personal.

197
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:46,370
Can you see the important difference between
the neutral and informal sentences?

198
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:54,809
The neutral sentence uses we in both parts,
while the informal sentence is more direct:

199
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:58,389
...until you sort this out.

200
00:17:58,389 --> 00:18:04,340
The points you’ve seen so far in this lesson
are true for both spoken and written English.

201
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:11,070
However, there are some features of formality
which apply only to written English.

202
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:17,389
Let’s take a look.

203
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:26,719
In writing, informal language uses contractions
like he'll, it'd, or we're.

204
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:34,149
In informal written English, you can also
use abbreviations, like btw for by the way,

205
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:37,860
ttyl for talk to you later, etc.

206
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:45,279
In formal writing, you generally wouldn’t
use contractions or abbreviations.

207
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:51,390
In neutral writing, you can use contractions
and some abbreviations.

208
00:18:51,390 --> 00:19:00,779
However, some abbreviations, like plz for
please, are informal and shouldn’t be used

209
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:04,280
if you want to sound neutral.

210
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:09,480
There are also some abbreviations which are
possible in formal English.

211
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:16,110
For example, HR for Human Resources would
be okay in formal language.

212
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:23,090
If you want to write something in formal English,
and you aren't sure whether an abbreviation

213
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:29,199
is appropriate or not, then it's best to write
the full form.

214
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,240
Let’s see some examples:

215
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:39,270
Just for your information, we would like to
schedule another meeting in October.

216
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:47,299
(Formal—there are no contractions or abbreviations)

217
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:53,519
Just for your information, we’d like to
arrange another meeting in October.

218
00:19:53,519 --> 00:20:03,159
(neutral—uses contractions, but no informal
abbreviations).

219
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:06,750
Just FYI, we'd like to fix up a meeting in
Oct.

220
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:15,029
(Informal—with contractions and abbreviations)

221
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:21,350
Written language is often held to a higher
standard than spoken language, so it’s important

222
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,178
to get the tone right.

223
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:29,620
In particular, don’t use language which
is too informal.

224
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,850
If you’re not sure, aim for a neutral tone.

225
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:39,610
Let’s look at one more example:

226
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,629
Thank you for all the hard work you have done.

227
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:49,000
(Formal—there are no contractions or abbreviations)

228
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,590
Thank you for the hard work you’ve done.

229
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:58,570
(Neutral—uses contractions, but no informal
abbreviations).

230
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:03,290
Thx for everything you’ve done.

231
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:07,580
(Informal—with contractions and abbreviations)

232
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:17,059
Hopefully, now you have a good understanding
of formality in English, and how to use formal,

233
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:20,039
neutral and informal English.
