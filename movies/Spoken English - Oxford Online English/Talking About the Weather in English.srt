00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,060
Hello, I’m Michael.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,450
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:10,440
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to talk
about the weather in English.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,410
Do you know what it means if someone says
'it’s chucking it down today'?

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,280
If someone says 'it’s baking today', do
you know what they are talking about?

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,750
In this class, you’ll learn words, phrases
and idioms that you can use to describe different

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,680
kinds of weather.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,500
British people are famous for talking about
the weather.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Do you know why?

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,729
It’s because in the UK we have a lot of
weather.

11
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,410
You never know what the weather will be like.

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,870
You can have all four seasons in one day.

13
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:44,540
We are going to look at a typical British
day, so the weather is going to be very changeable.

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,610
This means that weather can change quickly
and unpredictably.

15
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,960
It can be sunny, and then 30 minutes later,
it will start snowing.

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,950
So, first we wake up and it is a bit cold.

17
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,040
How would we describe this?

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,899
I could say that it’s a bit chilly.

19
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:04,019
This means that it’s a little cold.

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,649
Not very cold, just a little cold.

21
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,360
Autumn mornings are often chilly.

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,999
In chilly weather, you might want a light
jacket, but you won’t need a heavy coat,

23
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:16,679
or a scarf, or anything like that.

24
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:19,380
But what if it’s very cold?

25
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,289
You could say that it’s freezing.

26
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,939
You might say that you can see your breath.

27
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:27,829
Freezing means that it is very cold.

28
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:30,458
Not just chilly, but very cold.

29
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:32,119
Antarctica is freezing.

30
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:35,529
Northern Canada in winter is freezing.

31
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:40,369
To see your breath means that you can literally
see the air when you breathe on it.

32
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:44,069
Usually if you can see your breath it is freezing.

33
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:48,319
If the weather is so freezing that you can
see your breath you probably will need to

34
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,220
bundle up.

35
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,419
Bundle up means to wear layers of clothes
to keep yourself warm.

36
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:59,009
When the weather is freezing you need to bundle
up.

37
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,659
On freezing mornings, it can be very, very
difficult to get out of bed.

38
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,840
But let’s imagine that we get up because
we have to go to work.

39
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,780
So we leave the house and it’s drizzling
at the moment.

40
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,780
Drizzling means that it is raining lightly.

41
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,860
It’s not heavy.

42
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,570
Drizzle is so light that it can look like
mist.

43
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:25,180
We can also say that it is only spitting.

44
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,980
Spitting is even lighter than drizzling.

45
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,390
It means that a few raindrops are falling,
but it isn’t really raining.

46
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,630
Before it rains, it might start spitting and
then get heavier.

47
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,350
Then, suddenly the heavens open.

48
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,769
This means that it starts raining heavily.

49
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,730
How else could I describe it if it is raining
a lot?

50
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,850
I could say that it is chucking it down.

51
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,049
This means that it is raining a lot.

52
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,150
It is really heavy.

53
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:01,930
It is the type of rain that people find it
difficult to drive in or walk in.

54
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,100
As I am walking to work my clothes are getting
soaked.

55
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,590
This means that my clothes are very wet because
of the rain.

56
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,190
Luckily I bought my umbrella today.

57
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:20,010
So we get to work, only a little damp from
the rain thanks to the umbrella.

58
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,239
Damp means that something is slightly wet.

59
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,070
My clothes are a little wet because of the
rain.

60
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:31,540
And from my window I can see that it’s very
overcast and dark overhead.

61
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,480
To say that it is overcast means that the
clouds are covering the sky.

62
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,000
You cannot see the sun.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,110
When it is dark overhead you are saying that
the clouds are very black.

64
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:49,600
Most likely this is because it is raining
or going to rain soon.

65
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,840
So it is dark overhead and overcast.

66
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,959
You think there’s going to be a storm.

67
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,819
You could say that there is a storm brewing.

68
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:02,160
This means that you think a storm will start
very soon.

69
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,069
You’re sure there’s going to be a storm;
you can see it in the sky.

70
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:08,130
And then you see lightning.

71
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:14,380
Lightning is a large electric flash of light.

72
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,199
And after the lightning you hear thunder.

73
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:22,370
Thunder is the noise that you hear caused
by lightning.

74
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,229
Usually you will hear thunder after you see
lightning.

75
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:30,449
We call these storms thunderstorms.

76
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:35,689
Thunderstorms are storms that have lightning,
thunder and it is also chucking it down as

77
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:38,580
well.

78
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,050
When the storm starts, the wind picks up.

79
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,960
Soon, it’s almost a gale.

80
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,068
The wind picks up when the wind becomes stronger.

81
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:52,669
A gale is a very strong wind, which can be
dangerous.

82
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:56,378
Lucky for you when it is time to go home the
storm has finished.

83
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,509
It is now sunny and hot.

84
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:01,590
You won’t need your umbrella anymore.

85
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:07,599
You walk outside and there isn’t a cloud
in the sky and it is baking hot.

86
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,630
This means that it is very hot.

87
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,199
It is baking hot in the Sahara Desert.

88
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,620
It’s completely still.

89
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,249
That means there’s no wind at all.

90
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:20,379
We can also say that it is a scorcher today.

91
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:23,389
This also means that it is extremely hot.

92
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:28,310
In Australia, most days in the summer could
be described as scorchers.

93
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,279
Another way to say this is to say that it
is boiling.

94
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:39,490
So if the temperature is very hot we can say
that it is baking hot, a scorcher or boiling.

95
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,740
The walk home from work is a lot better than
your walk to work this morning in the rain.

96
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,340
So you get home and watch the weather forecast.

97
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,619
The weather forecast is the prediction for
the next day or week of what the weather will

98
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,849
be like.

99
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:59,490
The weather forecast tells you that tomorrow
it will begin with a bit of frost on the ground

100
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,719
and it will be sleeting.

101
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:06,090
In the afternoon there will be flurry of snow
but then it will turn into a blizzard by the

102
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,508
evening.

103
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:11,300
The snow on the floor will turn into slush.

104
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,509
It will be below freezing for most of the
day.

105
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:16,520
What does this mean?

106
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,998
It will begin with a bit of frost on the ground.

107
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:24,590
Frost are ice crystals on a frozen surface.

108
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:30,039
When it is freezing the ground may be covered
in frost.

109
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,630
Usually in winter in the UK we have very frosty
mornings.

110
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,830
And it will be sleeting.

111
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,449
Sleet is rain and snow mixed together.

112
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:43,559
Sleet happens when snow melts as it falls.

113
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:47,009
In the afternoon there will be a flurry of
snow.

114
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:51,600
A flurry of snow means that there will be
light snow for a short time.

115
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,810
It won’t be heavy and it usually doesn’t
stay on the ground.

116
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,759
But it will turn into a blizzard by the evening.

117
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,099
A blizzard is a storm with lots of snow and
wind.

118
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:08,180
Usually planes can’t take off or land when
there is a heavy blizzard.

119
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,909
The snow on the floor will turn into slush.

120
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:15,879
Slush is snow or ice that has partly melted.

121
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:19,699
Usually snow will turn into slush when the
weather gets warmer.

122
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:24,759
Walking in slush is very unpleasant, because
cold water will get into your shoes!

123
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,219
It will be below freezing for most of the
day.

124
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:34,639
When we say it is below freezing we are saying
that the temperature is below 0°C.

125
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,520
This means that it’s freezing.

126
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,930
So I‘ll probably want to bundle up tomorrow!

127
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,300
So what have we learnt today?

128
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,370
We have learned that Britain’s weather is
very changeable and hopefully we have learned

129
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,659
how to describe the weather in more detail
using phrases and expressions.

130
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,599
Thanks very much for watching!

131
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,039
I hope that you have found it useful.
