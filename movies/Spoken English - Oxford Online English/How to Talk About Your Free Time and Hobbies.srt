00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:07,700
Hello, I'm Oli. Welcome to Oxford Online English!
In this lesson, you can learn about how to

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:14,860
talk about your free time and hobbies in English.
What do you like doing in your free time?

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:20,460
Do you have any interesting hobbies? Talking
about your free time is a great way to start

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,170
a conversation in English, or to find things
in common when you're speaking to somebody.

5
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,480
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able
to speak clearly and naturally about your

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,050
free time and your hobbies in English.

7
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:40,690
Part one: free time and hobbies vocabulary.
What words do you know for free time activities

8
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:48,159
in English? Some people prefer things you
can do at home, like watching TV, reading,

9
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:55,300
or cooking. Other people like sports, like
playing football, playing basketball, playing

10
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:02,638
tennis, going swimming, going jogging, or
going climbing, or maybe doing boxing, doing

11
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:04,330
judo, or doing yoga.

12
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:11,350
Of course, many people prefer more social
activities, for example, hanging out with

13
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:18,000
your friends, relaxing with your family, or
going shopping. Or maybe you like to do something

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,570
more creative, like taking photos, painting,
or writing stories or writing a blog. What

15
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:31,779
about you? What kind of free time activities
do you prefer? Let's look at how you can talk

16
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,550
about free time activities and hobbies which
you like.

17
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:46,300
Part two: what do you like doing? In my free
time, I like . . . What could you say here?

18
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:53,350
"In my free time, I like playing basketball."
"In my free time, I like relaxing with my

19
00:01:53,350 --> 00:02:02,600
family." "In my free time, I like reading
books." Can you see a pattern here? In every

20
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:10,220
sentence, after 'like,' we use a verb plus
-ing. Can you make a sentence? What do you

21
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:18,390
like doing in your free time? But just using
'like' can be repetitive and boring. So what

22
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,649
other verbs can you use?

23
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:30,170
Well, you could use verbs like 'love', 'enjoy',
or 'hate'. For example: "I love going swimming."

24
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:39,630
"I enjoy watching TV." "I hate going shopping."
Can you see the same pattern? After all of

25
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:49,040
these verbs, you need to use a verb with -ing.
You can also add words like 'really', 'sometimes',

26
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,840
or 'absolutely', to make your meaning stronger
or weaker. For example: "I really like taking

27
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:04,959
photos." "Sometimes I enjoy going jogging."
"I absolutely hate playing football."

28
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:12,180
Now it's your turn. What can you say? Can
you make your own sentences? OK, so now you

29
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,530
can say something about what you like or don't
like doing. Let's look at how you can add

30
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:25,020
more details to your ideas. First, let's say
how often you do your free time activity.

31
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:33,030
For example: "I like playing sport. I play
football every Tuesday evening." "I absolutely

32
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:40,890
hate going shopping. I only go shopping once
or twice a year." "I really like taking photos,

33
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:48,319
but I don't get the chance to do it often."
What about you? How often do you do your hobbies?

34
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:56,390
You can use these phrases to help you talk.
'Every . . .' For example: 'every weekend',

35
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:07,260
'every Saturday afternoon', 'every day'. 'Once
or twice a . . .', for example: 'once a week',

36
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:14,970
'twice a month', 'three times a year', and
so on. Can you make some sentences like this

37
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:20,930
about your free time and hobbies? How often
do you do your hobbies?

38
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:29,139
Next, let's add some details about where you
do your hobby or free time activity. For example:

39
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:35,970
"I like playing sport. I play football every
Tuesday evening at the park near my house."

40
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:42,410
"I enjoy having coffee with my friends. We
go to a cafe in the city center once or twice

41
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:48,660
a week." "I really like taking wildlife photos
in the forest, but I don't get the chance

42
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,180
to do it often."

43
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,090
You can see that our answers are getting more
detailed. When you speak, you should always

44
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,710
try to add some details to your ideas, like
this. It will make your English sound more

45
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:07,370
interesting and more natural. What about you?
Can you add some details like these to your

46
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:14,150
sentences? Pause the video. Practice. Try
to make some sentences. Say them out loud.

47
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,599
Practice a little bit.

48
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,160
OK. next, let's look at giving background
information, especially if you have an interesting

49
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:30,010
or an unusual hobby. You can talk about when
and why you started doing it. For example,

50
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:37,000
"I started playing tennis when I was 10."
"I've been learning to paint for six months

51
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,949
now." "I decided to do yoga because I wanted
to be healthy." "My French friend got me into

52
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:52,949
climbing." In the last sentence, the phrase,
"My friend got me into something," means that

53
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:58,449
your friend introduced this activity to you,
and now you like it.

54
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:04,330
What can you say about your hobby? Can you
use some of these phrases to talk about yourself?

55
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,039
For example, I started climbing when I was
living in Russia. I've been climbing for about

56
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:18,220
eight years. I also recently decided to do
yoga because I wanted to be more flexible.

57
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:26,199
When I was younger, my dad got me into photography.
What about you? What are your examples?

58
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:32,199
Finally, let's look at how you can add some
descriptive words to say why you do or don't

59
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:39,550
enjoy something. For example, "I like climbing
because it's really exciting." "I love doing

60
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:46,330
yoga because it's so relaxing." "I really
like writing stories because it's creative,

61
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:52,039
and I like using my imagination." You can
also use negative adjectives to talk about

62
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:59,800
things you don't like. For example, "I don't
like going jogging because it's tiring." "I

63
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:06,229
hate watching TV because I find it boring."
"I've been trying to learn to paint, but it's

64
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:13,520
too hard." Why do you like your hobbies? What
are some activities you don't like doing?

65
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,190
Can you say why you don't like them?

66
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:23,050
Try to make some sentences and practice using
this language. OK, now it's your turn to speak.

67
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:29,850
Let's try using everything we've looked at
to make a longer answer. For example, "I really

68
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:35,410
like playing tennis. I play every weekend
at the park near my house. Sometimes I play

69
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:40,380
with my brother, or sometimes with a friend.
My brother got me into it because he loves

70
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,930
sports, and he needed someone to play with.
I didn't like it at first because it was hard,

71
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:52,669
and I lost all the time. But now, I enjoy
it, especially when I beat my brother."

72
00:07:52,669 --> 00:08:01,080
OK, let's do one more sample answer. "I love
taking photos. Once or twice a month, I go

73
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,508
to different areas of the city and look for
interesting pictures to take. I've been interested

74
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:11,759
in photography since I was young, when my
dad got me a camera for my birthday. I like

75
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,460
it because it's creative, and I can express
myself through my pictures. Anyone can use

76
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:22,198
a camera, but you need to use your imagination
to find good pictures."

77
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:29,330
Now, can you talk about your free time? What
do you like doing? Where do you go, and how

78
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:37,449
often? When did you start doing this hobby,
and why? And, why do you like or, perhaps,

79
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:45,310
dislike this activity? Try to talk for at
least 30 seconds. Give lots of details. Add

80
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,449
details to make your answer more interesting.

81
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:53,690
OK, that's the end of the lesson. Thanks very
much for watching. I hope you learned something

82
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,540
about how to talk about your free time in
English. You can see more free lessons on

84
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,200
