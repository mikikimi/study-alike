00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,629
Hi, my name is Olivier.

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,399
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,190
Do you travel abroad, for work or for pleasure?

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,730
If so, do you normally stay in hotels?

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:19,060
Are you comfortable using English to reserve
a room, check in or out, and deal with any

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,390
problems you have during your stay?

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,610
In this lesson, you can learn how to use English
in common hotel situations.

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,680
It can also help you if you work in a hotel.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,899
Imagine you're traveling abroad and you need
to arrange a hotel.

10
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,300
What's the first thing you need to do?

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:44,149
Nowadays, you’ll often reserve your hotel
room online, but sometimes you might need

12
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:47,780
to make a reservation by phone, or even in
person.

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,460
Let’s see how you can do this:

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,549
Hi, I’d like to make a reservation.

15
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:53,359
Yes, of course.

16
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,809
When would you like to check in?

17
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,459
On the 3rd of November.

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,389
And how many nights would that be for?

19
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:01,949
For three nights.

20
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,500
And what kind of room were you looking for?

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
A double room.

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,620
It’s for my husband and me.

23
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,620
Ok.

24
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,200
We do have one double room available for those
dates.

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,330
It’s $80 a night, so that comes to $240
for the three nights.

26
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,070
Yes, that’s fine.

27
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,070
Great.

28
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,070
Can I take your name?

29
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,039
Yes, it’s Sarah Banks

30
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,210
Thank you, Ms. Banks.

31
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,919
Can I just take a credit card from you to
make the booking?

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,870
Yes of course, here you are.

33
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,390
Okay Ms. Banks, that’s all finished.

34
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,140
Is there anything else I can help you with?

35
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,040
Yes, could I have a confirmation emailed to
me?

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,950
Yes of course, what’s the email?

37
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,450
It’s s dot banks at gmail dot com.

38
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,140
Okay, I’ll send that over to you now.

39
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,270
Excellent, thank you very much.

40
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,649
You’re welcome.

41
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,160
We look forward to seeing you.

42
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,539
Thank you, goodbye

43
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,580
Goodbye.

44
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:04,270
Let’s look at some key phrases and useful
vocabulary from this section.

45
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,589
You can start the conversation by saying something
like:

46
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,390
I’d like to make a reservation for the 3rd
of November, for three nights, please.

47
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,339
Of course, you can change this to suit your
situation, like this:

48
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:24,420
I’d like to make a reservation for the 20th
of May for one night, please.

49
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,048
The receptionist might ask you:

50
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:29,739
What kind of room are you looking for?

51
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:31,409
What could you say here?

52
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:34,660
You could ask for a single or a double room.

53
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,200
If you’re travelling with a friend, you
might ask for a twin room, with two separate

54
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:41,659
beds.

55
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:46,849
You could also ask for a triple room for three
people, or maybe a family room, which might

56
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:49,819
have four or even more beds.

57
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:53,738
Finally, if you need a lot of space, you can
ask for a suite.

58
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:59,150
A suite is like an apartment, with a living
room, possibly a kitchen, and one or more

59
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,459
bedrooms.

60
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:05,180
The dialogue you just heard was easy—there
were no problems or surprises—but what if

61
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,400
the hotel is full on the dates you want?

62
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,370
I’d like to make a reservation for
the 20th of May for one night, please.

63
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,659
Very well, sir, and what kind of room do you
need?

64
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:16,719
I’d like a triple room, please.

65
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,409
I’m sorry sir, but don’t have any triple
rooms available on that date.

66
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,989
It’s a holiday period and we’re almost
fully booked.

67
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:27,919
I could offer you a family room, which has
four beds.

68
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,219
Would that work for you?

69
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:31,409
That could work…

70
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:32,730
How much is it?

71
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,529
It’s $195.

72
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:37,189
Ah, I see.

73
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:41,209
That’s more expensive than the triple.

74
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:43,480
Is there any way you could offer a discount?

75
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,709
I’m sorry sir, as I said before, it’s
a holiday period and we expect to be very

76
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:50,299
busy at that time.

77
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:51,299
I see…

78
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,359
Alright, then.

79
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:54,279
I’ll take it.

80
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:55,559
That’s fine.

81
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,569
Can I take your name for the reservation?

82
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:00,790
This time, the conversation didn’t go so
smoothly.

83
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,400
The receptionist said:

84
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,260
We don’t have any triple rooms available
on that date.

85
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,260
The receptionist also gave a reason.

86
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,780
Do you remember what it was?

87
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,840
She said:

88
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,430
It’s a holiday period and we’re almost
fully booked.

89
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,240
Fully booked means that every room has already
been reserved.

90
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,250
You might also hear something like:

91
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,300
I’m afraid we don’t have anything free
on those dates.

92
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:35,580
Luckily, this time you were able to get a
room, even if it was more expensive than you

93
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,950
were hoping for.

94
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:42,190
What’s the next step?

95
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,380
You arrive at your hotel and go to reception
to check in.

96
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,450
Do you know what you should say here?

97
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,909
Let’s look together!

98
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,820
Hello, welcome to The Palm Hotel

99
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,790
Hello, I have a reservation; the name’s
Sarah Banks

100
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,840
Yes, I see that here.

101
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,140
I have you in a double room for three nights;
is that correct?

102
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes, that’s right.

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,620
How many keys would you like?

104
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,020
Two, please.

105
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,969
Okay, here you are.

106
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,560
Enjoy your stay, Ms. Banks.

107
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,760
Thank you.

108
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,219
OK. That seemed easy.

109
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,720
And usually, it should be.

110
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,500
But perhaps there’s a problem.

111
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,010
Let’s look at an example that doesn’t
go so well.

112
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,070
Hello, welcome to The Palm Hotel
Hello, I have a reservation.

113
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,810
What name was it under?

114
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,300
Sarah Banks.

115
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,260
I’m sorry, I don’t have a reservation
under that name.

116
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,000
How did you make the booking?

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,200
I did it on the phone.

118
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,659
I actually have a confirmation here with me,
would that help?

119
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,920
Yes, please.

120
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,720
OK, yes, now I see the reservation.

121
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,060
I think there was a problem with the spelling.

122
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,060
I do apologize.

123
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,480
It’s no problem.

124
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,820
Now, you’ve checked in and you’re ready
to enjoy your stay.

125
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,120
What next?

126
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,810
You might need to go back to reception to
arrange extra services, or to ask about the

127
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,510
hotel’s facilities.

128
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,190
Let’s look at our first dialogue:

129
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,540
Is there anything else I can help you with,
Ms. Banks?

130
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,310
Yes, I would like a wake-up call tomorrow,
if possible.

131
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,960
Yes of course; what time would you like the
call?

132
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,049
7.30 please, actually… better make it 7.

133
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,710
Okay, no problem.

134
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,280
I’ll make a note of that.

135
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,619
Also I need to go to the airport on Wednesday
morning.

136
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,520
Do you offer a shuttle service?

137
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,330
Yes, we do.

138
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,700
What time's your flight?

139
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,789
It’s at 10.30am.

140
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:46,130
Okay, we have shuttles to the airport every
hour, so I think you could take the 8am shuttle.

141
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,550
Perfect, thank you.

142
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,110
The guest asked for two different things.

143
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,140
Do you remember what they were?

144
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:01,030
She asked for a wake-up call, and she asked
about the airport shuttle.

145
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:05,419
A shuttle is a bus which drives between two
places.

146
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:11,030
Many hotels offer airport shuttles, which
drive between the airport and the hotel.

147
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,289
Let’s look at some of the polite language
from this dialogue.

148
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,380
To ask for a wake-up call, I said:

149
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,060
I would like a wake-up call tomorrow, if possible.

150
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,330
Adding if possible on the end of the sentence
is not necessary, but it makes it sound more

151
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,240
respectful and polite.

152
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,080
To ask about the airport shuttle, I said:

153
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,390
Do you offer a shuttle service?

154
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:39,080
You could use this question to ask about other
hotel facilities.

155
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,800
For example:

156
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,340
Do you offer 24-hour room service?

157
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,739
Do you offer a dry-cleaning service?

158
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,070
Do you offer conferencing facilities?

159
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:57,240
Can you think of anything else you could ask
about here?

160
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,480
Let’s see some more ways to ask about hotel
facilities:

161
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,910
Hello, how can I help you?

162
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,330
Yes, hello.

163
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,530
I need some restaurant recommendations.

164
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,888
Okay, no problem.

165
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:15,780
Our concierge on the other side of the lobby
can recommend a good restaurant and help you

166
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,969
to make reservations.

167
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,690
Thank you.

168
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:23,340
Also, I wanted to ask: what kind of gym facilities
do you have?

169
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,530
We have a complete gym and small swimming
pool just down this corridor.

170
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:31,680
The swimming pool also has a sauna and a steam
room.

171
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
Wonderful!

172
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,468
Thanks for your help.

173
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:39,380
Oh, actually, one last thing: what’s the
WiFi password for the hotel?

174
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,990
It’s Palmbeachhotel.

175
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,450
All one word, with a capital P at the start.

176
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,210
And that works everywhere in the hotel?

177
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,400
Yes, it does.

178
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,079
Thank you very much.

179
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,440
You’re welcome.

180
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,840
Let’s look at some of the useful language
from this dialogue.

181
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,820
A concierge works in a hotel and can help
guests to arrange things in the local area.

182
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,190
For example, a good concierge can help you
to book theatre tickets, find the best Thai

183
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,930
restaurant in town, or organize a sightseeing
tour of the city.

184
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:17,209
The phrase I wanted to ask is a good way to
introduce a question politely.

185
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,690
You can use it in many ways.

186
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,820
For example:

187
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,270
I wanted to ask: is it possible to check out
one hour late?

188
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,840
I wanted to ask: what time is breakfast?

189
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:35,370
Okay, at this point, you’ve checked in and
you’re getting comfortable.

190
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,720
But what if something goes wrong?

191
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,960
Hello, do you need any help?

192
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,279
Yes, I have a few problems with my room.

193
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,490
Okay, I’m sorry to hear that, what seems
to be the problem?

194
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,610
Well, first of all there’s an issue with
the heating.

195
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,470
It’s very hot, and I can’t seem to turn
it down.

196
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,820
Okay, I’ll send somebody to take a look
at that.

197
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,150
Was there anything else?

198
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,540
Yes, actually.

199
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,610
I’m not sure if it’s normal, but my key
doesn’t always work in the door.

200
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,630
Sometimes I have to put it in five or six
times before it works.

201
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,260
Am I doing something wrong?

202
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,750
I’m sure you aren’t, madam!

203
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,550
Sometimes, older key cards don’t work so
well.

204
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,540
Let me make you a new key right now.

205
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,980
That’s great; thanks so much for your help.

206
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,670
You’re very welcome.

207
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,620
Here’s a good phrase to use if you have
a problem during your hotel stay:

208
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,510
There’s an issue with…

209
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,610
For example:

210
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,630
There’s an issue with the sink in the bathroom.

211
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,520
Can you think of any other ways you could
say this?

212
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,500
You could say something like:

213
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,830
Something’s wrong with the sink in the bathroom.

214
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,380
I think there’s a problem with the sink.

215
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:56,589
Next, let’s look at one more example where
things don’t go so well.

216
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,420
Yes, can I help you with something?

217
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,750
I’d like to make a complaint.

218
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,440
My room hasn’t been cleaned properly.

219
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,970
I’m very sorry about that, sir.

220
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,580
What exactly is wrong?

221
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:15,100
There’s dust everywhere and I found a hair
on the pillow which definitely isn’t mine.

222
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,330
I have to say this is unacceptable.

223
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:24,910
If I’m paying this much money, the least
I should be able to expect is clean bedding.

224
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,959
I completely agree sir, and once again, I’m
very sorry.

225
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:33,430
Here’s what I can do for you: I can offer
you a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe room.

226
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,500
I’ll also make sure that housekeeping double-check
the room before you use it, so that we can

227
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,290
be sure it’s perfectly clean.

228
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:45,270
Well, that’s fine, but still, this sort
of thing shouldn’t happen.

229
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,270
You’re right, of course.

230
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:51,310
I’ll communicate this issue to our management
so we can investigate and find out exactly

231
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,619
why this happened.

232
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,080
When can I move rooms?

233
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,310
As soon as you’re ready.

234
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:00,180
Just call reception and we’ll send someone
to help you with your bags.

235
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,979
This time, the situation was a little tenser.

236
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:10,820
However, you can see some good phrases here
to express anger without being rude.

237
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,360
For example:

238
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:19,390
I have to say this is unacceptable. This sort of thing shouldn't happen.

239
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,260
The least I should be able to expect is…

240
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,200
These phrases are interesting, because they’re
quite formal, but they also express quite

241
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,140
strong emotion.

242
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:36,120
Normally, formal language is cold-sounding
and emotionless, but using phrases like these

243
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,060
shows that you’re really unhappy with the
situation.

244
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,300
Now, your problems have all been solved and
it’s time to go home again.

245
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,560
What’s the last thing you have to do?

246
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,140
Hi, I’d like to check out please.

247
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,939
Yes of course; how was your stay?

248
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,020
Very nice, thank you.

249
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,620
Here is a copy of your bill.

250
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,660
The room and tax are already paid, so these
are just the extras.

251
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,010
That seems fine, can you put it on my credit
card?

252
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,240
Yes of course, I’ll just do that now…

253
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,000
What extras might you have to pay?

254
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,510
You might have to pay for any drinks or snacks
you take from the minibar.

255
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:21,930
You might also be charged for phone calls,
room service, or movies.

256
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,099
In the dialogue above, everything was fine.

257
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,440
What if there are things on your bill which
you don’t agree with?

258
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,640
Hello, can I help you?

259
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,880
Hi, I’d like to check out please.

260
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:33,899
Certainly…

261
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:37,240
Here’s your bill.

262
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,120
The total seems higher than I expected; what
exactly are these additional charges?

263
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:48,310
Let me have a look.
OK, this payment is for the water and snacks

264
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:54,040
you had from the minibar, and it looks like
this is a phone call that was made to the

265
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
United States.

266
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,930
Right, I see now.

267
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,199
Yes, that’s fine.

268
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,980
I’d like to pay cash, if that’s OK?

269
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,160
Yes, no problem.

270
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,839
Thank you for staying with us.

271
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,780

00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,550
