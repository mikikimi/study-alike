00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:09,000
Hi I'm Martin. Welcome to Oxford Online English.
In today's lesson we're going to talk about

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,059
my favourite sport - football.

3
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:21,939
Even if you don't like football it's a great
idea to know a little bit of football vocabulary!

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,029
Why?
When I go to different countries, if I'm wearing

5
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:32,180
my football top, like this one, then more
people just start speaking to me. Talking

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:41,449
about football will make it easier for you
to start using your English and make new friends.

7
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:47,910
In this lesson, we’re going to go to a football
match. It’s an important game for me, and

8
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:58,029
I’m very excited. I hope you are, too! Ready?
Let’s go.

9
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:05,460
Let me take you to a game. We're going to
see my favourite team, Bournemouth. Their

10
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,750
nickname is the Cherries.

11
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:17,400
Bournemouth are great to watch because they
score a lot of goals! Unfortunately they let

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,890
in a lot of goals too.

13
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:27,480
It’s a bit of a rollercoaster ride for their
fans, but great for the neutral.

14
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:35,270
We're playing Swansea in the Premier League.
I'm really hopeful about this game because

15
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:42,860
the last time we played Swansea was the last
time we kept a clean sheet.

16
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:52,070
Also, we won our last game against West Ham,
so it's a chance for back to back victories.

17
00:01:52,070 --> 00:02:00,190
Let’s take a look at some of the words I
just used.

18
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:09,079
This is a real rollercoaster ride. Rollercoasters
go up and down a lot.

19
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:16,740
When we are talking about sport, we use rollercoaster
ride to mean something that can make you very

20
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:24,800
happy one minute and then very sad the next
minute and then happy again.

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:33,720
Think of your emotions going up and down,
like they were on a rollercoaster ride.

22
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:46,280
Fan is another word for supporter. I support
Bournemouth. They are my team. I am a Bournemouth

23
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
fan.

24
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:55,310
A neutral is someone who does not support
either of the teams who are playing in a match.

25
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:01,920
If I watch Bournemouth play, of course I’ll
support my own team. If I watch two Italian

26
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,069
teams, I’ll be neutral. I don’t generally
mind who wins, and I just want to see a good

27
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,269
match.

28
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:17,580
When a team does not let in any goals in a
game, they have kept a clean sheet. Goalkeepers

29
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:25,320
like to keep a clean sheet, because it means
they’ve done their job very well.

30
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,280
If a team wins two games in a row, they have
won back to back victories.

31
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,849
If they win three or more in a row there are
several ways to say this.

32
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:33,849
You could say:

33
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:34,849
They’ve won three games in a row .
They’ve won three games on the bounce.

34
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:39,209
Okay, fingers crossed for back to back wins.
Let’s head to the match.

35
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:46,040
Here's the stadium; let's take a look inside.

36
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,489
As you can see there are four stands. You
used to be able to stand and watch the game

37
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:58,090
but nowadays everybody is supposed to sit.

38
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,980
Traditionally the home fans go behind this
goal…

39
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:10,349
…and the away fans go behind the other goal.

40
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:17,560
The two stands alongside the pitch are also
for the home fans. At Bournemouth they are

41
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:25,110
called the East Stand and the West Stand.
We’ll sit in the West Stand today as I have

42
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:33,999
season tickets. This means I have the same
two seats for every game. One for me and one

43
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:39,120
for you.
We can see the dugouts where the staff of

44
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,740
the two clubs will sit - the manager, his
assistant and the subs.

45
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:53,439
The manager chooses the team and the tactics
they will use, and is also responsible for

46
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,800
how they train and prepare.

47
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:05,509
11 players start a game and there are 7 more
who can be used later in the game.

48
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:15,020
These are the substitutes, or subs. The manager
can use a maximum of 3 of them.

49
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:21,539
When he takes a player off, he can send a
sub on.

50
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:26,400
Let’s talk about the tactics for this game!

51
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:35,310
I’ve lost count of how many times we’ve
hit the post and crossbar this season! If

52
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:44,599
we can just fire one in on target today, we’ll
score – they’ve got a dodgy keeper.

53
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:53,319
Bournemouth have to be careful in this game
because Swansea are very good from dead ball

54
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,719
situations such as corners and free kicks.

55
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:06,000
I think Eddie – that’s our manager - will
opt for a 4-4-2 formation today.

56
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,990
4-4-2 means four defenders, four midfielders,
and two forwards or strikers.

57
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:21,509
So there’ll be four defenders: two central
defenders and two wing-backs.

58
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:30,309
Then, four midfielders: two holding players
and two supporting the attack, plus two strikers

59
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:31,620
up front.

60
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:40,280
We’ll be looking to keep possession using
quick one-twos and triangles.

61
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:47,690
He likes the team to press up – we just
have to guard against getting caught on the

62
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,690
break.

63
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:59,770
Look, look there’s the ref and the players
coming out of the tunnel. Eddie Howe’s Barmy

64
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,979
Army. Cherries! Cherries!

65
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:07,529
Let’s take a look at some of the words I
just used.

66
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:15,429
The goalkeeper – or keeper – is supposed
to stop the opposition from scoring goals.

67
00:07:15,429 --> 00:07:20,698
A dodgy keeper is one who is not very good.

68
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:27,369
We also use dodgy for other things, such as
cars that keep breaking down, or areas of

69
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:35,639
a city that are not very safe. Dodgy is a
conversational way to say bad.

70
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:44,090
A dead ball situation means that play has
stopped. For example, one player fouls another,

71
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:51,948
the referee will stop play and give the fouled
player’s team a free kick.

72
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:58,610
Some players are specialists at free kicks,
like Cristiano Ronaldo.

73
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:07,240
Corners are taken from the corner of the pitch.
The corner taker will usually put in a cross—a

74
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:13,499
pass which goes across the face of the goal.
The strikers will try to get to the cross

75
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:15,849
and score a goal.

76
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:21,509
Wing-backs play on the left or right side
of the defense.

77
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:30,959
Holding players are defensive midfielders.
They stay further back and protect the defenders.

78
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:37,090
Strikers play at the front. Their job is to
score goals.

79
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:43,000
When your team is in control of the ball,
they have possession. The other team must

80
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,450
try to win it back. We’ll be trying to keep
possession, which means we’ll try to keep

81
00:08:49,450 --> 00:09:00,740
the ball as much as possible.A one-two means
that two players quickly pass the ball back

82
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:07,960
and forth. Player A passes to player B, who
returns it quickly to player A.

83
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:18,780
A triangle means three players form a triangle
shape and pass the ball around quickly.

84
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,959
Pressing up is an aggressive style of play.
It means we’re going to get into the other

85
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:33,230
team’s half. We won’t let their players
have time on the ball, even in their own half.

86
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:39,261
Sounds good, right? But there’s a problem:
if all of your players are attacking, you

87
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:47,319
might get caught on the break. The other team
counterattacks quickly, which is dangerous

88
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,590
because you don’t have many players at the
back.

89
00:09:52,590 --> 00:10:00,000
Ref is a short form of referee. He is in charge
of the game.

90
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,971
The ref tosses the coin (demo it), our captain
calls heads – and it is heads. We’ll take

91
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:15,780
the kick off.

92
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:23,410
Well that’s the end of the first half. It
was a bit of a cagey affair to be honest,

93
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,569
but I’d say we just shaded it.

94
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:32,390
Let’s hope there’s more action in the
second half. 15 minutes to get a cuppa and

95
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:37,000
a pie – or do you fancy a quick one?

96
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,031
Right, the second half is underway.

97
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:49,000
The keeper rolls it out to our left back and
he sets off up the wing.

98
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,320
He plays a perfect 1-2 with a midfielder and
then some wonderful dribbling to beat two

99
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,840
players.

100
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,860
He lays it off to our centre forward, who
hears a shout of “man on” from one of

101
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,550
his team mates.

102
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:13,479
He puts in a slide rule pass to the other
striker, who fires it into the back of the

103
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:24,870
net. One-nil! The crowd go crazy!
Let’s take a look at some of the words I

104
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,780
just used:

105
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:36,000
Cagey means that both teams were playing very
carefully. Cagey games can be boring, because

106
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,450
both teams are trying not to lose, rather
than trying to win.

107
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:49,990
We just shaded it means that we were slightly
better than the other team. Maybe we created

108
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:54,320
more chances, or had more possession.

109
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:02,260
A cuppa means a cup of tea or coffee. A quick
one means a beer.

110
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:09,330
Dribbling means running past players whilst
keeping the ball at your feet. Lionel Messi

111
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,680
is probably the best dribbler currently playing.

112
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:22,589
He’s very good at running with the ball
and getting past opposition players.

113
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:28,830
If you’re dribbling and you get past an
opposition player, you beat them. If you say

114
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:38,490
he beat two players, that means he got past
two players who were trying to stop him.

115
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:48,440
If you lay the ball off you play a short pass,
usually with the ball going backwards or sideways.

116
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:55,950
If you’re playing football and you hear
someone shout man on, you need to pass the

117
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:04,040
ball or move quickly, because an opposing
player is coming to take the ball from you.

118
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:12,770
A slide rule pass is a very accurate pass
that goes between opposition players. Mesut

119
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:19,790
Ozil and Andreas Iniesta are well known for
their slide rule passes.

120
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:26,459
He fires it into the back of the net means
he scores a goal. If he fires it, it means

121
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:34,070
he hits the ball hard, so it was probably
a good goal. What am I saying? It was definitely

122
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,720
a good goal!

123
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,410
Bournemouth are controlling the game now.

124
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:49,240
That Swansea player has already been shown
the yellow card by the ref and he’s just

125
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,080
committed a very bad foul. What’s the ref
going to do?

126
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:03,240
It’s a 2nd yellow card – two yellows equals
one red and so he is sent off.

127
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,790
He has to leave the pitch. Swansea are down
to ten men.

128
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,000
Bournemouth score again, with a header!

129
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,720
[TEXT ONLY-DON’T READ [PART FIVE – VICTORY!]

130
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:22,220
There’s the final whistle. 2-0 and three
points to Bournemouth!

131
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:30,710
That pushes Swansea nearer relegation but
we’re mid table now. We should be safe—I’m

132
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:36,670
confident we’ll stay up and be in the Premiership
again next season.

133
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:44,800
Hopefully Brighton will get promoted; it would
be great to have a local derby next season.

134
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:52,560
At the end of the season, the bottom three
clubs are relegated from the Premiership down

135
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,630
to the Championship—one league lower than
the Premiership.

136
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:06,280
The bottom three teams go down. The other
teams stay up.

137
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:13,670
The top two clubs are promoted from the Championship
up to the Premiership.

138
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,750
The four teams in positions 3-6 play off for
the last promotion spot. Whichever team wins

139
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,750
the playoffs is the third team to be promoted
to the Premiership.

140
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,750
We say the promoted teams “go up”.

141
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:22,860
If Brighton are promoted, we’ll have a local
derby next season. A local derby is a match

142
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:30,410
against a team from the same city or a nearby
city. These teams are often fierce rivals—they

143
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:34,839
are very competitive with each other.

144
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:41,710
For example, if Real Madrid play Atletico
Madrid, that’s a local derby, because both

145
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,380
teams are from the same city.

146
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:49,000
Well, I hope you enjoyed the game.

147
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,920
Don’t forget to practice some of the words
you have learned – use them to make new

148
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,520
friends – or even when you are playing a
game yourself!

149
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:10,500
I’ve told you who my favourite team are
– so please tell me in the comments which

150
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,150
team you support!

151
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:21,470
And who do you think is the best player in
the world at dribbling? Who’s the best keeper

152
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,480
and the best striker?

153
