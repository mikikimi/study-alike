00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,040
Hi, I’m Kasia.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,730
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,870
In this lesson, you’re going to learn how
to talk about money in English.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,579
You’ll learn useful English words and phrases
to talk about common money topics such as your

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,710
spending habits, salary, borrowing money,
and more.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,169
But wait, is it okay to talk about money?

7
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:29,080
Maybe you heard someone say that it can be
rude to talk about money in the UK or in the

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,418
US.

9
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:32,509
Sometimes it’s not appropriate.

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:37,610
For example, it’s generally not acceptable
to ask someone how much they earn.

11
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:43,879
However, people talk about money all the time;
in this lesson you’ll see how to talk about

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:50,160
money in a natural way in English.

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,639
You’re going on holiday again?!

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,670
How can you afford it?

15
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,310
I can barely pay my rent each month.

16
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,060
Well, I’ve been saving up for it.

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,030
How do you do it?

18
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,060
I make a budget for each week, so I decide
how much I can spend, and what I can spend

19
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,060
money on.

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,490
That way, I know how much I’ll save.

21
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,729
But how does it work?

22
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:18,340
I’m pretty careful with my money, but I
find it really difficult to save much.

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,469
It’s the little expenses that add up.

24
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:26,288
You buy a bottle of water here, a sandwich
there, a takeaway pizza in the evening…

25
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:31,320
They don’t cost much, but over time you
end up spending more than you realise.

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,689
I guess you’re right.

27
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:34,529
But, how do you stick to it?

28
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,750
Don’t you just want to have a takeaway pizza
once in a while?

29
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,829
Ask yourself: which would you rather have?

30
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:45,298
Most people waste a lot of money on things
they don’t really want.

31
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,619
I really love travelling, so I’m happy to
cut back on some less important things so

32
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:52,079
that I can pay for it.

33
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,639
You’re right, but I don’t think I could
be that frugal.

34
00:01:55,639 --> 00:02:01,179
I’m not a big spender or anything, but I
really enjoy splashing out and treating myself

35
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:02,179
occasionally.

36
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:08,539
Here’s a question: can you name three things
you can do with money?

37
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:12,809
You heard a lot of useful phrases in the dialogue.

38
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,980
Of course, you can spend money.

39
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:21,720
You can also save money or waste money.

40
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,670
You spend money on something.

41
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,690
For example:

42
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,970
I don’t spend much on food.

43
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,340
He spends a lot of money on gadgets and technology.

44
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,200
How much do you spend on rent every month?

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,480
You can use waste money in the same way:

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,799
They waste a lot of money on things they don’t
need.

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,060
Someone who spends a lot is a big spender.

48
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,700
The opposite?

49
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,700
Someone who spends very little money is frugal.

50
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,230
These words are neutral; they don’t have
positive or negative associations.

51
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,060
What about save money?

52
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,640
You can save for something, or you can save
to do something.

53
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,739
Often, instead of saying save money, you can
use the phrasal verb save up, which has the

54
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,180
same meaning.

55
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,310
For example:

56
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,660
I’m saving up for a holiday next year.

57
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,180
We’re saving up to buy a car.

58
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,900
In order to save money, you can make a budget:
you make a spending plan, and write down everything

59
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,710
you spend so that you stick to your plan.

60
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:42,710
If you’re saving for something, you might
need to cut back on other things, meaning

61
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:46,600
that you spend less than usual.

62
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,530
On the other hand, some people aren’t so
good at saving.

63
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,400
Some people like to splash out; they spend
money on things they enjoy.

64
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,140
You can also treat yourself, by spending more
money than you usually would in order to do

65
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,809
something nice for yourself.

66
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,810
What about you?

67
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,819
Are you a big spender, or are you more frugal?

68
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:16,839
Do you find it easy to make a budget and save
money, or do you like to splash out and treat

69
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,599
yourself?

70
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,650
Think about these questions and how you could
answer them.

71
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:29,159
If you aren’t sure, remember that you can
go back and review the dialogue and the explanations

72
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,300
again.

73
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,730
Let’s move on.

74
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,710
So, I’m thinking of moving to London.

75
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,680
I got a job offer, but I’m not sure about
the salary.

76
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,440
It sounds good, but I’ve heard London is
expensive, so I’m not sure.

77
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,900
I guess it depends on your lifestyle, but
you definitely need more than in other places.

78
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,409
My friends who live in London all make decent
money, but they don’t have much left over

79
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,100
at the end of the month.

80
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,900
Mostly, they’re just getting by.

81
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,440
They offered me 25k.

82
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,630
That would be okay in most places I’ve lived,
but I’m not sure I’ll be able to make

83
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,400
ends meet in London.

84
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,140
It’ll be challenging!

85
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,800
That’s on the low side, for sure.

86
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,380
Put it this way: I know someone who makes
around 45k, and she says she struggles in

87
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,380
London.

88
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,580
Anywhere else, you’d be very well-off making
that sort of money.

89
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,859
Hmm…

90
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,400
I guess I’ll look for something better.

91
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,299
In most English-speaking countries, people
talk about annual salaries: the amount you

92
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,930
make each year.

93
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:42,310
Also, it’s normal to talk about the amount
before tax.

94
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:49,750
For example, ‘25k’ in the dialogue means
25,000 pounds per year before tax.

95
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:55,230
In case you’re wondering, the average salary
in London is around 29,000 pounds per year,

96
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:00,590
while the average cost of living for a family
of four is around 4,000 pounds per month,

97
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,780
assuming a comfortable but fairly basic lifestyle.

98
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:11,698
If your salary is higher than average, you
can say you make good money or make decent

99
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,430
money.

100
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:20,250
In this case, you’ll probably be well-off:
not rich, but with enough money to have a

101
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,570
nice lifestyle and not worry about money.

102
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:30,610
On the other hand, if you only just make enough
to cover your costs, you can say you’re

103
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,139
just getting by.

104
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:40,310
This means that you have enough money to live,
but not much more.

105
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:46,699
If you say, I’m just getting by, it suggests
you don’t have a lot of extra money to spend

106
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:52,870
on eating in restaurants, going out, travelling,
and so on.

107
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,870
For example:

108
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,120
I don’t earn a lot, but I get by.

109
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,590
--> Meaning: I make enough to pay all my bills,
but I don’t have much spare money.

110
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:10,619
If someone doesn’t even make enough to cover
their basic expenses, like rent, bills, food

111
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,680
and transport, then they are struggling.

112
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,830
You can also use the phrase make ends meet,
which you heard in the dialogue.

113
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,440
Do you know what it means?

114
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,710
Make ends meet means to cover all of your
expenses.

115
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,698
Let’s see some examples:

116
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,970
I can barely make ends meet.

117
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,420
He’s struggling to make ends meet.

118
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,260
I don’t know how we’d make ends meet if
we had another child.

119
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:45,270
If you say that someone can barely make ends
meet, you mean that they don’t earn much

120
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:49,919
money, and so it’s difficult for them to
pay all their bills and cover their regular

121
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,250
expenses.

122
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,070
What salary do you need to make to get by
where you live?

123
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:00,120
How much does someone need to make to be well-off?

124
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,730
Think about these questions and how you would
answer them.

125
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:10,550
Let’s look at the next section.

126
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,550
Did you hear?

127
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,759
He might lose his house.

128
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,420
He told me he’s six months behind on his
mortgage payments.

129
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,280
Seriously?

130
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,330
I knew he was in debt, but I had no idea it
was that bad.

131
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,520
He has other loans too, apparently.

132
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,180
The car, the furniture: everything was bought
on credit.

133
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,680
He has three or four credit cards, all maxed
out.

134
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,579
He owes a lot of money.

135
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,729
What’s he going to do?

136
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:43,960
Well, he can’t even keep up with the interest,
let alone the actual repayments.

137
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,370
He’ll have to declare bankruptcy, but he’ll
lose everything.

138
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,460
That’s awful.

139
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:56,490
Of course, he should have been more responsible,
but how could they lend him so much money?

140
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,360
They must have known he wouldn’t be able
to pay it back.

141
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
I don’t know.

142
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,960
It’s a bad situation.

143
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,020
When you borrow money from the bank, you take
out a loan.

144
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,360
If you’re borrowing money to buy a house
or an apartment, there’s a special word

145
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,010
for it: mortgage.

146
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:24,520
The spelling is strange, so practice the pronunciation:
mortgage.

147
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,360
You need to repay a loan.

148
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,250
Generally, you do this by making payments
every month.

149
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:40,420
Some of the payment is interest: an extra
percentage which you pay to the bank.

150
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:45,880
When you finish paying back a loan, you pay
it off.

151
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,080
If you have a lot of loans, then you’re
in debt.

152
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,020
This means you owe money.

153
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,680
In the dialogue, you heard the phrase he owes
a lot of money.

154
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,400
Let’s look at some more examples with this
language:

155
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,180
It’ll take us another ten years to pay off
our mortgage.

156
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,500
The interest on our car loan is ridiculously
high.

157
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,300
I never borrow money; I don’t like being
in debt.

158
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:20,510
In the dialogue, we were talking about someone
who had bought a lot of things on credit.

159
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:27,380
If you buy something on credit, you take out
a loan just to buy this one thing.

160
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,870
We also mentioned that he has maxed out credit
cards.

161
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:37,110
You max out a credit card when you borrow
the maximum amount you can on it.

162
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:43,290
Finally, if you can’t pay back your debts,
you’ll have to declare bankruptcy.

163
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:49,310
Your debts are cancelled, but you also lose
anything you have which is worth money.

164
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:57,779
So, think about some questions: have you ever
taken out a loan or bought something on credit?

165
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:04,550
In your country, if someone is in a lot of
debt, can they declare bankruptcy?

166
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,209
What happens to the money they owe?

167
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:13,560
Again, think about how you would answer these
questions, and review the dialogue and the

168
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,180
explanations if you need to.

169
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,370
Ready to move on?

170
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:25,350
Let’s talk about one more thing.

171
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,880
Can I tell you something?

172
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
What?

173
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,939
I’m so excited!

174
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,480
I’m going to be rich!

175
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,280
Really?

176
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,680
How’s that?

177
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,020
I found this article online.

178
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,910
It told me about all of these shares which
are definitely going to go up very soon.

179
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,149
I bought as many as I could.

180
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:48,350
Now I just have to sit back and wait for the
money to come rolling in.

181
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,170
Are you sure about this?

182
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,319
How much did you put in?

183
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,760
All the savings I had.

184
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,839
And…

185
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,680
Are you sure that’s a good idea?

186
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,719
Why not?

187
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,570
These shares will take off, and I’ll double
or triple my money.

188
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,140
It’s easy.

189
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,870
What if they go down?

190
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,660
You could lose everything!

191
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,079
It’s not likely.

192
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,620
These companies are solid.

193
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,550
It’s a one-way bet!

194
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,719
So, which companies did you invest in?

195
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:30,550
Well, one was… er… .and then… er…

196
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:35,000
I can’t actually remember the names, but
it’s very exciting stuff.

197
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,840
Biotech, you know?

198
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,200
Oh, really?

199
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,580
Well, good luck.

200
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:43,350
You can buy me dinner when you’ve made your
first million.

201
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,350
Deal!

202
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,660
What can you do with your savings?

203
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:54,079
You can keep them in the bank in a savings
account, but you won’t earn much interest.

204
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:01,769
Alternatively, you can invest in something,
like shares, bonds, or funds.

205
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:06,440
You can say shares or stocks; both have the
same meaning.

206
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,610
You say stock market, but in other cases,
share is more common.

207
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:16,140
You can invest in or put money into something.

208
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,199
More informally, you can also get into something.

209
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,480
For example:

210
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,740
Do you think I should get into crypto?

211
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,320
He put half of his savings into government
bonds.

212
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,610
You should only invest in shares if you know
what you’re buying.

213
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:40,420
When you buy an asset, like a share or a bond,
its price can go up or down.

214
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:45,349
If it goes up very far or fast, you can say
it takes off.

215
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,300
If it goes down very fast, it crashes.

216
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,439
For example:

217
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,040
I bought Apple shares in 1989.

218
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,170
I knew they’d take off one day!

219
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:03,380
They lost a lot of money when the stock market
crashed in 2008.

220
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:08,420
If you do well, you might double or triple
your money.

221
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:15,930
Triple means you increase something three
times; for example, if you turn 100 dollars

222
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,599
into 300 dollars.

223
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,839
If you don’t do well, you could lose everything
or get wiped out.

224
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,150
If you get wiped out, you lose all of the
money you invested.

225
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,790
Let’s look at some example sentences:

226
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:37,050
If you make 7 per cent a year, you can double
your money in ten years.

227
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:43,849
He put his life savings into Enron shares,
then got completely wiped out.

228
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,570
If you had savings to invest, what would you
invest in?

229
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,779
Think about how you would answer.

230
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:57,890
Finally, we have one more question for you:
some people say that money can’t buy happiness.

231
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,110
Do you agree with this idea?

232
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,020
