00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,160
Hi, I'm Gina. Welcome to Oxford Online English!

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:16,970
Where do you live? Do you live in a small
town, a big city, or a remote village? What’s

3
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,150
it like?

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:25,749
In this lesson, you can learn how to describe
your hometown in English.

5
00:00:25,749 --> 00:00:34,760
Let’s start with some basic English vocabulary
you can use to talk about your hometown.

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,530
Part one: introducing your hometown.

7
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:50,370
Let’s start with a simple sentence.

8
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,580
"I live in a ________."

9
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,070
What could you say? You could say something
like:

10
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,280
"I live in a city"; "I live in a town"; "I
live in a village."

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:10,540
That’s a good start, but it’s very basic.
Let’s add a bit more detail.

12
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:16,250
What’s it called? How big is it?

13
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:27,500
"I live in Paris. It’s the capital city";
"I live in Shanghai. It’s a huge city";

14
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:37,500
"I live in a small town. It’s called Banbury";
"I live in Manarola, which is a tiny village

15
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,220
by the sea."

16
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:46,360
Better! You should always try to add more
details when you speak.

17
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:57,930
What about you? Where do you live? Can you
make one or two sentences like this? Pause

18
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,130
the video and practice!

19
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:12,299
Okay, let’s move on. We need to make our
answers more detailed and interesting.

20
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,090
Part two: adding background and details.

21
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,280
Think about these questions:

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:28,700
What’s your hometown famous for? Can you
think of some words you could use to describe

23
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:36,170
your hometown?
How long have you lived there?

24
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:44,149
Add these ideas to your answer to make it
longer and more detailed. For example:

25
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:55,120
"I live in Paris, the capital city. It’s
famous for its landmarks such as the Eiffel

26
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:04,499
Tower, Notre Dame Cathedral or the Louvre.
It’s also well-known for its food, of course!"

27
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:14,709
"I live in Shanghai. It’s a huge, bustling,
international city. People from all over the

28
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:17,810
world live and work there."

29
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:28,150
"I live in a small town called Banbury. I’ve
been living there for about five years, since

30
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,749
I finished university. It’s a pretty sleepy
place, to be honest."

31
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:42,099
Let’s look at some useful vocabulary from
these examples which you can use when you

32
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:43,099
speak.

33
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,220
We said:

34
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:51,500
"Paris is famous for its landmarks such as
the Eiffel Tower."

35
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:59,840
Landmarks are famous places or buildings,
like the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Sydney

36
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,980
Opera House or Christ the Redeemer in Rio.

37
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:13,608
Does your hometown have any famous landmarks?
What are they called in English?

38
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:15,540
Next, we said:

39
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,932
"Shanghai is a bustling city."

40
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:17,932
Do you know what this means?

41
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:28,340
It means there’s a lot of activity. There
are lots of people, lots of traffic, lots

42
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,140
of life and energy.

43
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:44,349
Is your city bustling or sleepy? If a town
is sleepy there’s not much activity and

44
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,760
things are quiet.

45
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,093
What about your hometown. Look at our questions
again:

46
00:04:49,093 --> 00:05:02,090
What’s your hometown famous for? Can you
think of some words you could use to describe

47
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,979
your hometown?
How long have you lived there?

48
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:18,640
What could you say about your hometown? Pause
the video and try to make 2-3 sentences.

49
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,190
Okay? Let’s look at our next point.

50
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:29,270
Part three: saying what you like about your
hometown.

51
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:39,890
What’s good about your hometown? What do
you like most about it?

52
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:46,780
Different people like different things in
a city or town. Let’s look at some example

53
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:53,109
sentences which express positive feelings:

54
00:05:53,110 --> 00:06:37,840
"I love living in Paris. It’s got such a
rich culture 

55
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:51,619
and there’s always something interesting
going on."

56
00:06:51,620 --> 00:07:54,540
"Shanghai’s a great place to live. It’s
a real 24-hour city and you can meet people

57
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,110
from all over the world."

58
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:13,320
"Living in Banbury suits me. It’s a quiet
place and it’s small enough that you can

59
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:28,960
get to know your neighbours and have a sense
of community."

60
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,309
What’s important for you? Do you want to
live somewhere with a rich culture and a sense

61
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,309
of history, or do you prefer more modern,
international cities? Would you rather live

62
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,309
somewhere larger and more energetic, or somewhere
smaller and more peaceful?

63
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,309
Think about these ideas. You’ll need them
in a minute!

64
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,309
Let’s look at some useful language from
our examples:

65
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,309
"I love living in _______"; "_______’s a
great place to live"; "Living in _______ suits

66
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,309
me."

67
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,309
Of course, you can change these to say what
you want to:

68
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,309
"I quite like living in _______"; "I really
like living in ________";

69
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:42,309
"I suppose I don’t mind living in ________."

70
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,309
We also saw some useful phrases in our examples:

71
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:44,310
"It’s got such a rich culture"; "There’s
always something interesting going on"; "It’s

72
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,310
a real 24-hour city"; "You can meet people
from all over the world"; "It’s small enough

73
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,310
that you can get to know your neighbours";
"You have a sense of community."

74
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,310
What does that last phrase mean?

75
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,310
If you have a sense of community, it means
people know their neighbours and feel like

76
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,310
they belong to a wider community. Smaller
towns and villages often have a better sense

77
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,310
of community, perhaps because people have
more time to talk to each other and do things

78
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,310
together.

79
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,310
What about your hometown? Could you use any
of these phrases to describe where you live?

80
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,310
Next, what if you don’t like something about
your hometown?

81
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:58,410
Part four: saying what you dislike.

82
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:04,269
Let’s look at some examples which express
negative feelings:

83
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:14,820
"Paris is great, but the cost of living is
really high. That can be quite stressful because

84
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,730
you’re always thinking about money and how
to make ends meet."

85
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:30,399
"Shanghai’s an exciting place, but it’s
really crowded and it can be exhausting to

86
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,149
live there. Air quality can be an issue, particularly
in the summer."

87
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:43,060
"Banbury’s nice, but sometimes I find it
a bit boring. There’s not much nightlife

88
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:50,979
and sometimes it feels a 
bit cut off from the wider world."

89
00:09:50,980 --> 00:10:01,370
When talking about things you don’t like
about your hometown, you can use adjectives

90
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,339
like, 'stressful', 'crowded', 'boring'.

91
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:13,350
You can make your answer more interesting
by using phrases. We saw some useful ones

92
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,509
in our examples:

93
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:23,980
"The cost of living is really high"; "You’re
always thinking about how to make ends meet."

94
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:31,069
Meaning: you’re always thinking about how
to pay for your basic living costs.

95
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:41,019
"It can be exhausting to live there"; "Air
quality can be an issue"; "There’s not much

96
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:50,500
nightlife"; "It feels a bit cut off from the
wider world." Meaning: you feel like you’re

97
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,300
far away from people, culture and activity.

98
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:01,008
Could you use any of these phrases to describe
your hometown?

99
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:09,769
Remember that you can also change the phrases
to fit your ideas. For example:

100
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:21,449
"Traffic can be an issue"; "There’s not
much for young people to do"; "It can be very

101
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:24,019
stressful to live here."

102
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:37,559
Okay, what about you? Try to make 3-4 sentences.
Say what you like and dislike about your hometown.

103
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:44,529
Use the key words and phrases from parts 3
and 4.

104
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:47,529
Go on, pause the video and practice!

105
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:53,630
Okay? We have one more thing to do:

106
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:59,439
Part five: describing how it’s changed over
time.

107
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:12,370
What was your hometown like ten, twenty or
fifty years ago? How has it changed? How has

108
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,730
it changed over time?

109
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:26,630
Some places change very fast; other places
never seem to change at all!

110
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:35,149
Talking about changes can add interesting
and useful information to your description.

111
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:36,149
Let’s look:

112
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:38,670
"Paris has changed a lot in the last twenty
years. It’s much more international and

113
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:48,860
much more expensive than it used to be. However,
the soul of the city is still there. Paris

114
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,769
will always be Paris!"

115
00:12:50,769 --> 00:13:00,410
"Shanghai is almost unrecognisable compared
to twenty or thirty years ago. The city has

116
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:10,420
expanded so much, both physically and economically.
It’s amazing when you see old photos of

117
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,329
the city; things are so different now!"

118
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:24,378
"Banbury hasn’t changed much as a place
in the last twenty years, but the mix of people

119
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:33,519
is a bit different nowadays. The population
used to be older and mostly English, whereas

120
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:42,779
now there are more young people living here,
including many people from other parts of

121
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:43,779
Europe."

122
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:51,290
Again, these examples contain a lot of useful
language you can use to talk about your hometown.

123
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,368
For example:

124
00:13:53,369 --> 00:14:00,139
"________ has changed a lot in the last twenty
years"; "________ is almost unrecognisable

125
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:05,720
compared to twenty years ago"; ________ hasn’t
changed much as a place in the last twenty

126
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
years."

127
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:28,610
Which of these sentences is true for your
hometown? Can you add details to explain why?

128
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,639
For example:

129
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:40,560
"It’s much more ________ than it used to
be"; "The city has ________ so much"; "The

130
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,930
________ is a bit different nowadays."

131
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,829
Now, you’ve seen a lot of useful language
you can use to talk about your hometown. Let’s

132
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:54,969
put everything together and practice making
a longer answer.

133
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,300
Part six: review.

134
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:05,599
Do you remember all the points we talked about?
We covered:

135
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:13,999
Introducing your hometown, adding background
and details, talking about what you like or

136
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:20,529
dislike about it, talking about how it’s
changed over time.

137
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:30,490
Follow these points and you can make a long,
detailed answer to describe your hometown.

138
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:34,569
For example:

139
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:46,969
"I live in St Petersburg. It’s the second
largest city in Russia, and it’s a beautiful

140
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:47,970
place to live. I’ve lived here all my life
and I can’t imagine living anywhere else!

141
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:55,679
It has such a rich culture, I think partly
because the city’s history is a mix of European

142
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:02,910
and Russian influences. I think that’s why
I like it here—it’s a unique place. Traffic

143
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:12,019
can be an issue in the city centre, but public
transport is very good. The city hasn’t

144
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:19,190
changed much in the last twenty years, although
there are certainly more and more tourists

145
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,190
these days!"

146
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:31,319
Could you make an answer like this? Let’s
do one more example first. I’ll tell you

147
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:33,430
about my hometown:

148
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:41,479
"I’m from Denver, the capital of Colorado.
It’s near the Rocky Mountains, so the surrounding

149
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:49,779
area is quite beautiful. I’ve been living
here for about three years. I really like

150
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:55,149
Denver because it’s a young city with lots
of energy, but if you need a break it’s

151
00:16:55,149 --> 00:17:05,950
easy to drive to the mountains and find a
quiet place to relax. The only real disadvantage

152
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:16,049
is that winter can be seriously cold! Denver’s
changed quite a lot in the last twenty years—many

153
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:23,959
people are moving here to work. Unfortunately,
the cost of living has also gone up quite

154
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,350
a lot."

155
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:35,399
Okay, now it’s definitely your turn! Talk
about your hometown. Make a longer answer

156
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:36,449
like these ones.

157
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:43,639
If you want, you can post your answer in the
