00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,040
Hello, I’m Mia.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,070
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:12,340
In this lesson, you can learn about how to
talk about and describe different kinds of

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,640
food in English.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,780
What kind of food do you like or dislike?

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,930
Do you like cooking, trying new recipes, or
eating out?

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,609
In this lesson, you can learn how to describe
food in detail in English.

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:31,900
You’ll see how to talk about food you like
or dislike using clear, natural English.

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,900
Ready?

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,900
Let’s start!

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,760
Part 1: Where are we going for dinner?

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,260
Imagine you’re with your friends.

13
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:47,079
You’re all hungry and want to go to a restaurant,
but you don’t know which one to pick.

14
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:53,850
You’re all very different and have different
ideas on what you want to eat.

15
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,850
You might say:

16
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,329
"Where should we go?

17
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:00,220
There’s a French restaurant on the square
if you want a slap-up dinner.

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,500
That’s quite expensive, though.

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,020
We could go to that new Asian buffet place.

20
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,729
They do Chinese-Vietnamese-Thai fusion; it’s
pretty good.

21
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:15,250
They’ll definitely have veggie options,
too, in case you don’t feel like meat.

22
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:20,759
Or, we could just go casual and get some fast
food or street food, and find somewhere to

23
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:21,759
eat outside."

24
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,009
Are you in the mood for something expensive?

25
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:28,070
Then you would want a slap-up dinner.

26
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,398
A slap-up dinner is an expensive, formal meal.

27
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:37,549
Maybe one of your friends wants something
a bit different, something more adventurous.

28
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:39,590
You could suggest a fusion restaurant.

29
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:45,369
Fusion is a mix of different foods from different
cultures or countries.

30
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:49,529
A buffet is always a good restaurant to go
to with friends.

31
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:53,950
You serve your own food and choose whatever
dishes you want.

32
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,249
Most buffets are all-you-can-eat, which can
be good value for money!

33
00:01:58,249 --> 00:02:02,279
Perhaps one of your friends is a vegetarian
and wants to make sure there is something

34
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:04,459
suitable on the menu.

35
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,829
You would need to find a place that has veggie
options, too.

36
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,790
Veggie means it’s okay for vegetarians to
eat.

37
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:19,090
The cheapest and fastest options are street
food and fast food.

38
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,879
Street food is food you can buy from a stall
or a kiosk on the street, and it’s usually

39
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,859
cooked in front of you.

40
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,900
Fast food is usually fried, fatty foods that
you can buy in cheaper restaurants, for example,

41
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,890
burgers, chips, kebabs, fried chicken, and
so on.

42
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,200
Part 2: Describing Tastes and Textures

43
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,189
Okay, now you’re in the restaurant.

44
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:47,390
Your food arrives, and your friend asks,

45
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,129
"How’s your food?"

46
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:53,239
What can you say to your friend?

47
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,379
Think about the last time you went to a restaurant.

48
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:58,840
How would you describe what you ate?

49
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,239
Let’s look at how you can describe tastes.

50
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:04,829
You might say something like:

51
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:07,140
"This curry’s very spicy!"

52
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,230
"The sauce is quite sour.

53
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,840
Maybe they put vinegar in?"

54
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,790
"I don’t like the vegetables.

55
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,679
They taste bitter."

56
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,109
"I like the soup; it’s salty!"

57
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:22,859
"The chicken has a kind of sweet flavour."

58
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:28,930
Spicy—you can also say hot—describes food
with a lot of chili, which makes your mouth

59
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:29,930
burn.

60
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,530
For sour, think of the taste of lemon.

61
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,190
It’s strong and acidic.

62
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:42,469
Some other kinds of fruit are sour: for example,
lime and grapefruit also have a sour taste.

63
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:46,950
Bitter is the taste of black coffee, or dark
chocolate.

64
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,879
Bitter tastes are often unpleasant.

65
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,840
Salty and sweet can be used to describe food
which contain salt or sugar respectively.

66
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,340
Salty is usually used if food contains a lot
of salt, so that you really notice the salt

67
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,340
in the food.

68
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:10,060
Sweet can be used for almost any food with
sugar, like ice-cream, cake, chocolate and

69
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,439
so on.

70
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,019
Okay, now that we’ve looked at how to describe
tastes, what about textures?

71
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,120
Texture is an important part of food.

72
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,169
Texture means how the food feels inside your
mouth.

73
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:28,740
For example, if you’re eating a packet of
crisps, you want them to be crunchy and crispy.

74
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:35,560
Both of these adjectives means that something
has a hard texture when you bite into it.

75
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,820
Crunchy and crispy foods are often noisy to
eat!

76
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,159
These are all crunchy and crispy foods.

77
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:50,370
Food which is undercooked or dry can be chewy—you
need to chew it for a long time before you

78
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,680
can swallow it.

79
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,979
For example:

80
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:58,039
"This pasta hasn’t finished cooking, it’s
too chewy."

81
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:02,510
"The fish was really chewy—they must have
cooked it for too long."

82
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:07,650
For meat, you might use the word tough instead.

83
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:14,000
Meat which is old or overcooked is often tough—it’s
difficult to cut and chew.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
For example:

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,560
"This burger was left on the barbecue too
long and now it’s tough."

86
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,919
Of course, when you’re eating something
like ice cream, you don’t want it to be

87
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:25,919
hard to eat.

88
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,979
If it has a really nice texture and it’s
very easy to eat, you can say it melts in

89
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:32,979
your mouth.

90
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:38,030
This is a positive expression to describe
soft textures.

91
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,510
You can use it for any fatty foods, including
desserts, meat or fish.

92
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,710
For example:

93
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,979
"These chocolate truffles just melt in my
mouth."

94
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,290
"The chicken was cooked so perfectly it almost
melted in my mouth."

95
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:56,080
Part 3: Positive Vocabulary and Expressions

96
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,120
We’ve looked at how to describe your food.

97
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,509
Now, imagine that you like your food very
much, and you want to tell your friends how

98
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:07,289
good your food is.

99
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:13,580
Of course, you can say that your food is delicious,
but you should really have more words and

100
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,580
phrases you can use.

101
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,560
Imagine this is your dessert that’s just
arrived at the table.

102
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,580
It looks good right?

103
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,840
You could say:

104
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,599
"It’s really yummy!"

105
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:30,450
"That looks mouth-watering."

106
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,349
"Mmm, scrumptious!"

107
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,740
These mean it tastes good.

108
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,650
Be careful using yummy as it sounds a little
childish.

109
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:45,130
Of course, you can use it, but be aware that
it has this association.

110
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,830
Other adjectives you can use that are more
advanced are mouth-watering and scrumptious.

111
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:56,039
Both of these adjectives means that the dessert
tastes really good.

112
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,889
You can use these adjectives for any food,
not just desserts.

113
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:05,840
Now imagine one of your friends has ordered
a chocolate cake for dessert.

114
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,198
You could tell them:

115
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,129
"That chocolate cake is very rich."

116
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,770
"Your cake looks really decadent."

117
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:19,400
If you order something that’s very luxurious
or is made very well, you use the adjectives

118
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,979
decadent or rich.

119
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:28,128
We usually use these adjectives for desserts,
usually those made with lots of heavy ingredients

120
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:31,220
like butter or cream.

121
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,080
If you’re talking about something savoury,
for example, a burger, when it’s cooked

122
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,698
well, you could say it’s tender or juicy.

123
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:45,150
Tender is used to describe meat which is soft
and easy to chew.

124
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,250
Juicy is also used for meat which is cooked
well.

125
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,030
If you overcook meat, it can get dry and tough.

126
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,068
Well-cooked meat should be juicy, which means
it still has plenty of liquid inside.

127
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:58,069
For example:

128
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:00,969
"This pork’s amazing; it’s really tender."

129
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:04,830
"A good steak should be juicy when you cut
into it."

130
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:10,200
That’s for meat, but what about vegetables?

131
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,729
Salads or raw vegetables could be crisp or
fresh.

132
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,230
This means that the vegetables have a good
texture and have not been sitting around for

133
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,289
a long time.

134
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:21,289
For example:

135
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:26,570
"I can tell my salad is really fresh from
how crisp the lettuce is."

136
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,569
Let’s review these words and phrases:

137
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:37,010
You can use yummy, mouth-watering and scrumptious
to mean that something tastes very good.

138
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:43,770
Tasty, heavy desserts, especially those made
with lots of butter or cream, could be decadent

139
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,590
or rich.

140
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,540
Meat which is cooked well should be tender
and juicy.

141
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,150
If you’re talking about salad, you would
want it to be fresh and crisp.

142
00:08:54,150 --> 00:09:01,060
Otherwise, you can of course use general words
like delicious, tasty or great to describe

143
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,170
food which you like.

144
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,011
Part 4: Negative Words and Expressions

145
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:11,800
Now, I want you to imagine a different situation.

146
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,530
Pretend you went to a different restaurant.

147
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,030
This restaurant is not as good.

148
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,030
The food is terrible!

149
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:24,390
So how do you describe something that tastes
bad?

150
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,770
You could use general negative adjectives
like disgusting or revolting.

151
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,680
You could also say that something turns your
stomach.

152
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:39,380
These words have a strong meaning; you use
them when something tastes extremely bad,

153
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:45,380
or looks so bad that you can’t possibly
put it near your mouth.

154
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,930
Imagine one of your friends has ordered a
dessert.

155
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,560
Have a look at this picture.

156
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,729
You could say:

157
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,950
"That dessert looks disgusting."

158
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,600
Or:
"I wouldn’t eat that, I’m sure it’d

159
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,170
be revolting."

160
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,579
Or:
"Just looking at that turns my stomach."

161
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:08,801
But be careful using these words and expressions
as they could be offensive, especially if

162
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:12,760
you’re talking about someone’s cooking!

163
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,430
Another friend orders a curry, but they aren’t
happy with it.

164
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,709
They say:

165
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,940
"This curry isn’t spicy, it’s bland and
completely tasteless."

166
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,120
Bland and tasteless have similar meanings.

167
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,350
They mean that the food doesn’t have any
flavour.

168
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,180
It’s not disgusting; it just doesn’t taste
of anything.

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,449
Two of your friends have ordered pizza, chips
and a steak.

170
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,470
When it arrives at the table they discover
it’s been cooked badly.

171
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,410
They tell the waiter:

172
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,810
"I can’t eat this pizza, it’s burnt."

173
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,750
"You’ve overdone this steak.

174
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,440
It’s like an old shoe!"

175
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,460
"My chips are undercooked.

176
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,350
They’re still cold in the middle."

177
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:02,920
If it’s the cooking that’s the problem
with the food, we use the adjectives burnt

178
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,449
or overdone to describe food that’s been
cooked for too long.

179
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:12,330
If the food hasn’t been cooked for long
enough, we would say it’s undercooked.

180
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:18,130
If your food has been cooked with too much
oil or fat, you could describe it as oily,

181
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,880
greasy or fatty.

182
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,370
Let’s review:

183
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:29,500
The phrase turns my stomach means that something
looks and/or tastes really bad.

184
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,250
You can also use the adjectives revolting
and disgusting.

185
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:38,960
If you’re describing food that’s very
plain and has no flavour, you can use the

186
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,070
adjectives bland or tasteless.

187
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:47,710
If you’re describing food that’s been
cooked too long, we say it’s burnt or overdone.

188
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,940
The opposite is undercooked.

189
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:58,160
Food with too much oil can be fatty, oily
or greasy.

190
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,010
Now we’ve reached the end of our restaurant
adventure, I hope you have a good idea about

191
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:08,069

and expressions.
