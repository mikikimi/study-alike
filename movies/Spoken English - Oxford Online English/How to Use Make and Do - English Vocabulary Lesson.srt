00:00:01,849 --> 00:00:06,359
Hello, I’m Niamh and welcome to Oxford Online
English.

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,930
In this lesson, we’re going to look at when
to use make and when to use do.

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,260
Does your language only have one verb for
make and do?

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:21,330
There isn’t one easy way to tell the difference
between make and do in English, but there

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,450
are some rules to help you.

6
00:00:22,451 --> 00:00:31,009
Generally, you use make when you create something
and do for an activity or task.

7
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:36,219
You’ll learn more about these rules, see
when the rules don’t work, and get a chance

8
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:38,719
to test yourself at the end!

9
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,399
Part one: use make to mean ‘create something
physical’.

10
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,319
As we said, you use make to talk about creating
something.

11
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:54,989
However, this is a general point, which includes
many smaller rules.

12
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,649
Let’s see one.

13
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:01,299
What connects this group of sentences?

14
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:04,760
This statue is made of marble.

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,149
The toy is made of plastic.

16
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:10,640
The house is made of gingerbread.

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,799
They all use make.

18
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:14,220
But what connects them?

19
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,450
Can you guess?

20
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,030
We use make to talk about the materials which
you use to create something.

21
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:30,990
Here’s a question: you’re watching this
video on a phone, a tablet or a computer.

22
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,548
What’s it made of?

23
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:39,049
Probably, it’s made of plastic, metal and
glass.

24
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:47,399
So that’s rule number one: use make to describe
the materials used to create something.

25
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,640
Remember our gingerbread house?

26
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,179
Let’s look at our second rule.

27
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,609
Here’s another sentence:

28
00:01:54,609 --> 00:02:00,548
I mmm some gingerbread for Christmas.

29
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:02,719
Which verb goes here?

30
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,390
Make or do?

31
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,020
I made some gingerbread for Christmas.

32
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:17,080
You use make with food and drink, because
you’re creating something.

33
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,510
Here are some more examples:

34
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,420
Can you make me a cup of coffee?

35
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,119
It's your turn to make dinner tomorrow.

36
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,230
My Dad makes the best sandwiches.

37
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,760
Now you know two rules about using make.

38
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,250
Let’s think about something new:

39
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:42,170
If you make a statue or make dinner, you’re
obviously creating something.

40
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,600
You have a physical result at the end.

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,930
But, there are some exceptions.

42
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:54,890
For example, you say do a painting or do a
drawing, even though you are creating something.

43
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,529
Monet did a lot of paintings of flowers.

44
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:05,060
There are also other things we make which
don’t produce a physical result.

45
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,760
Part two: use make to mean ‘creating something
non-physical’.

46
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,649
Look at a sentence:

47
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,180
He made a joke but nobody laughed.

48
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,100
Why do you think we use make here?

49
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:28,140
Let’s see some more examples, and you try
to work out the rule:

50
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,299
The politician made an important speech about
the economy.

51
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,500
They made so much noise I couldn’t hear.

52
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,120
She made an interesting comment in class.

53
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:49,130
Can you see what connects the words noise,
comment, speech, and joke?

54
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:55,480
They’re all nouns connected to speaking
and certain sounds.

55
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:02,090
Can you think of any other words like this?

56
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,630
You can also make a suggestion, make a call,
or make a slip of the tongue.

57
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:15,350
Make a slip of the tongue means you say the
wrong thing by accident, maybe because you

58
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,649
aren’t paying attention to what you’re
saying.

59
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,260
Be careful with comment.

60
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,710
These are nouns connected to speaking.

61
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:31,479
So, if you are speaking then you make a comment,
but if you are writing a comment you would

62
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,380
use the verb leave or add.

63
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,560
For example, please leave us a comment down
below!

64
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,840
There are other ways to use make meaning that
you create something, but not something physical.

65
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,429
For example:

66
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,810
She made lots of friends in the class.

67
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,940
We made great progress on the project.

68
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,310
He made a lot of mistakes on his exam.

69
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:04,320
I need to make an appointment at the clinic.

70
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,620
With phrases like this, it’s better to learn
and remember the phrase as one unit.

71
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,550
Finally, we often use make with money and
ideas connected to money.

72
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,720
So we say,

73
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,180
He makes €17,000 a year.

74
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,630
Their company made record profits last year.

75
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:38,010
I made a great investment and now I’m a
millionaire.

76
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,490
Or if you’re unlucky:

77
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,020
They made a loss after making too many bad
bets.

78
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:52,590
So, you can use make to mean ‘create something
physical’ or ‘create something non-physical’.

79
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,049
There’s one more common way to use make.

80
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,850
Part three: use make to mean ‘produce a
reaction in someone’.

81
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:08,780
You’ve seen how to use make for things,
but does it ever apply to people?

82
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,020
Look at an example:

83
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,000
Money makes me happy.

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,730
Can you understand why we use make here?

85
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:26,980
We use make when something causes an emotional
or physical reaction.

86
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,340
You can talk about physical reactions:

87
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,810
Thinking about what he said made me smile.

88
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,010
There’s too much dust and it is making me
sneeze.

89
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,830
…or emotional reactions:

90
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:44,530
The news made him angry.

91
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,260
It makes me sad to see you like this.

92
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,680
Okay, so now you’ve seen the most important
ways to use make.

93
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,450
Let’s review quickly.

94
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:05,270
You can use make: to talk about materials;
with food and drink; with nouns connected

95
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:12,640
to speaking and certain sounds; in some phrases
related to creating non-physical things (make

96
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:22,030
progress, make a mistake, etc.); with nouns
connected to money; and, when something causes

97
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,770
an emotional or physical reaction.

98
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:29,840
Alright, what about do?

99
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,030
Part four: use do to talk about activities
and work.

100
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,539
At the beginning, we said that we use do for
activities and tasks.

101
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:47,320
A common example is housework:

102
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,870
She usually does the laundry in the morning.

103
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:56,500
I’ll do the cooking if you do the washing
up.

104
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:02,480
We do our food shopping on Saturday mornings.

105
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,880
Most people don’t like doing this type of
work.

106
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,340
Do you like doing laundry, housework and homework?

107
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,000
Ah, remember: homework isn’t housework.

108
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:19,800
Good thing I mentioned it, though, because
we also use do in this way to talk about school

109
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,050
and studies:

110
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:28,479
I have to do a lot of homework every day.

111
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,130
What subjects are you going to do next year?

112
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,840
She’s going to do a film-making course.

113
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:42,620
Finally, we also use do with many tasks related
to business and work.

114
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,559
For example:

115
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:52,368
Please do your TPS reports by Monday morning.

116
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:56,389
Our firm does a lot of business in China.

117
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:59,379
How much more work do you have to do?

118
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:04,649
What connects of all these examples?

119
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:07,839
We use do for activities which are considered
work.

120
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,449
Of course, there are some exceptions.

121
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:15,339
For example, you can do a puzzle or do a crossword.

122
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:20,829
Crosswords are a great way to practise your
vocabulary and they’re great fun!

123
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:28,859
But you know sometimes, after doing lots of
work I feel like doing nothing and relaxing.

124
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,629
Hmm, what was that?

125
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:35,389
Part five: use do as a general verb.

126
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:37,810
Let’s look at another rule.

127
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:42,260
Do you remember what I just said at the end
of part four?

128
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,449
I said:

129
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:51,589
After doing lots of work, I feel like doing
nothing and relaxing.

130
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:54,819
You can use do to talk about activity in general.

131
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:59,219
Look at some more examples:

132
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,220
Look!

133
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,819
There’s a fire!

134
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:03,459
Do something!

135
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:07,550
Are you doing anything tomorrow?

136
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,649
She just wants to lie in bed and do nothing.

137
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:16,769
I’m tired of doing everything while you
sit around and watch TV!

138
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:24,740
This is common when you use do with the words
something, anything, nothing or everything.

139
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,809
Do here has a very general, basic meaning.

140
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:35,139
There’s one more way to use do with a general
meaning, but it’s slightly different.

141
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:42,769
Look at two examples and see if you can work
out what’s happening:

142
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:45,170
Can you put away your clothes?

143
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,229
I’ll do it later.

144
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,430
I’ll do the kitchen if you do the floors.

145
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,800
Can you see?

146
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,349
You can use do when the meaning of a verb
is obvious in the context.

147
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:05,490
So in the first example do replaces put away.

148
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,139
Can you put away your clothes?

149
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:09,649
I’ll do it later.

150
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:12,089
I’ll put away my clothes later.

151
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:21,899
In the second example, do replaces clean and
another verb, maybe sweep, vacuum or mop.

152
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,579
The exact meaning would be clear from the
context.

153
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:28,628
I’ll do the kitchen if you do the floors.

154
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:32,279
= I’ll clean the kitchen if you mop the
floors.

155
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,170
This is an informal way to use do.

156
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,259
So, let’s review.

157
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:46,930
We use do for: activities that are considered
work; activities in general, especially with

158
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:54,809
the words, something, anything, nothing and
everything; when the meaning of the verb is

159
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:56,660
obvious in the context.

160
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:01,589
Part six: test your skills!

161
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:08,480
Okay, so now you have some general rules to
help you to decide whether to use make or

162
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
do.

163
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,110
Are you ready to test yourself?

164
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,550
This will help you see how much you understand.

165
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:23,599
Remember you can always go back and look at
the rules again.

166
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,290
Complete the sentences.

167
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:36,759
How did you do?

168
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:42,629
If you didn’t get 100%, do the test again
the next time you’re studying and see if

169
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:45,259
your score improves.

170
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:51,160
You can find a longer quiz on the full version
of this free lesson, on our website: Oxford

171
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,499
