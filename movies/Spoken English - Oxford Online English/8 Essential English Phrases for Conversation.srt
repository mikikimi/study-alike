00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,759
Hi I'm Martin.

2
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:07,790
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:15,180
In this lesson, you can learn some essential
phrases to help you understand native speakers

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,039
and sound more natural when you speak English.

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,390
When you’re talking to a native English
speaker, do you sometimes find they use phrases

6
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,289
and questions which you haven’t heard before?

7
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:36,239
If you’ve learned English in classrooms,
there are probably many simple but important

8
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,879
phrases that you aren’t familiar with.

9
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:46,670
We’ll show you a few of these useful phrases
to help you understand and speak to native

10
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,670
English speakers.

11
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,910
Let’s start with a question.

12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,489
What have you been up to?

13
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,218
Have you heard this question before?

14
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,070
What does it mean?

15
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,700
How would you answer it?

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,070
I ask students this question all the time,
and they never know what it means.

17
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,850
So how should you answer it?

18
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,630
What have you been up to? is like asking What
have you been doing recently?

19
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:26,899
It’s a common question after you say hello
to someone, especially if you haven’t seen

20
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,650
that person in some time.

21
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,650
For example:

22
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,650
Hey!

23
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,650
Hi, Martin!

24
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,229
Long time no see.

25
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:36,369
How’s life?

26
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:37,369
Good!

27
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:40,460
What about you, what have you been up to?

28
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:46,699
Oh, not much, just busy with work and the
usual things.

29
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,380
Here are some other answers you could give.

30
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,880
Someone asks you What have you been up to?
and you could say:

31
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,070
I’ve just got back from my holiday.

32
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,219
I’ve been pretty lazy recently, to be honest.

33
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:11,870
I’ve been working so hard I haven’t had
much time for anything.

34
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,770
What about you; what have you been up to?

35
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,959
Hey Martin, what common phrases do your students
need?

36
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,690
Actually, I dunno.

37
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,400
I’d have to think about it.

38
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,120
Have you heard or seen the word dunno before?

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,450
It’s a short form of don’t know.

40
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,399
I dunno means I don’t know.

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:49,690
But actually, English has lots of these, like
gonna for going to, wanna for want to, and

42
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,200
so on.

43
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,299
However, words like gonna are generally used
in a sentence.

44
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,629
That makes it easier to work out the meaning.

45
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:05,250
Dunno can be used as a one-word answer.

46
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,140
In my experience, this can be confusing for
many non-native speakers!

47
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,140
For example:

48
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,619
Is he coming to the wedding?

49
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,720
Dunno.

50
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,980
What time is it?

51
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,739
Dunno.

52
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,980
What does hold on mean?

53
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,409
Dunno.

54
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:26,840
Really?

55
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,489
Okay, well Martin can’t help me.

56
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:33,040
What about you?

57
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,810
What does hold on mean?

58
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,830
Have you heard this before?

59
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,020
Actually, I do know!

60
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,980
Hold on means wait.

61
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,200
You might hear it on the phone.

62
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,909
You call a company to ask a question, and
you might hear:

63
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:56,280
Can you hold on for a moment, please?

64
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,659
This is like saying can you wait for a moment?

65
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,700
It’s also common during conversation.

66
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:10,100
If the person you’re talking to says something
you don’t understand, or that you don’t

67
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,590
agree with, you can say hold on to show this.

68
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,709
For example:

69
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:26,140
So, you start by multiplying the matrices
together to get your vectors…

70
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,919
Hold on, what does any of that mean?

71
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,670
Anyway, I told them that we’d be there on
Saturday morning…

72
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:41,700
Hold on, I thought we said we were going on
Sunday!

73
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:49,950
You can see that you can use hold on to interrupt
someone else if they say something you don’t

74
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,659
understand, or that you don’t agree with.

75
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,940
It’s a very useful and common phrase!

76
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,400
All this teaching’s making me thirsty.

77
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,340
Want a cup of tea?

78
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,560
Yeah, might as well.

79
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:15,960
If you ask someone a question, and they answer
might as well, what are they saying to you?

80
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,810
Might as well means there’s no reason to
say no.

81
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:26,480
So, it’s like saying yes, or why not?

82
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:34,470
It can also be used to say yes to something
when you don’t feel enthusiastic.

83
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,280
For example, imagine you miss a train.

84
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,950
You have to wait five hours for the next one.

85
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:47,320
Your friend asks if you want to go to the
cinema.

86
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:53,190
You don’t like the film which your friend
suggested, and you don’t want to watch it.

87
00:05:53,190 --> 00:06:01,700
But, you have five hours until your train,
and there’s nothing else to do, so you say,

88
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,570
yeah, might as well.

89
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,219
Might as well isn’t always negative like
this, though.

90
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:13,990
It can be used to say yes to something you
actually want to do.

91
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,310
For example, imagine you’re waiting for
a bus.

92
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,870
Your friend says, Why don’t we walk?

93
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,280
You think about it.

94
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,929
It’s not far.

95
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:31,970
You don’t know when the bus will come, and
it’s a beautiful, sunny day.

96
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,310
So, why not?

97
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,820
You say, Yeah, might as well!

98
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,230
I’m getting kind of tired.

99
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,960
We should take a five-minute break.

100
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
What do you reckon?

101
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,570
We’re only halfway!

102
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,599
We can take a break later.

103
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,880
What do you reckon? can have more than one
meaning.

104
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,150
Like all of these phrases, it’s very common
in spoken English!

105
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:07,090
First, it can mean do you agree?

106
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,090
For example:

107
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,710
Our plane’s at six.

108
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,080
We need to be at the airport at 4.30, so we
should leave here at two.

109
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,919
What do you reckon?

110
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:25,720
Here, I make a suggestion—we need to leave
at two—and I’m asking you if you agree

111
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,720
with my suggestion or not.

112
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:36,210
You can also use what do you reckon to ask
what’s your opinion?

113
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,500
For example:

114
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:44,540
Maybe I should quit and look for a new job,
but I’m not sure.

115
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,000
What do you reckon?

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,590
Here, I’m asking what you think: should
I quit and look for a new job, or should I

117
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,429
stay where I am?

118
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,350
I want to know what you think.

119
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:06,620
What do you reckon is almost always used as
a fixed phrase.

120
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,820
Generally, you don’t add anything after
it.

121
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,469
Can we have that break now?

122
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,270
In a bit!

123
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,359
You’re at work.

124
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,340
You ask your colleague to send you something.

125
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:27,080
She says, Yeah, I’ll get it to you in a
bit.

126
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,870
What does she mean?

127
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,780
In a bit means a short time later.

128
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:43,020
In our example, your colleague is saying she’ll
send you what you need a short time later.

129
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:51,500
So, she’s saying that she’ll do it, but
not right now.

130
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,140
You might also hear in a little bit.

131
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:01,740
Where else could you use this phrase?

132
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,420
Let’s see some more examples:

133
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,599
When will my computer be fixed?

134
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,260
We’re working on it now.

135
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,890
It should be done in a bit.

136
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,490
Can you come back in half an hour?

137
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,490
Want to go for dinner?

138
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:25,300
I’m not hungry right now, but we can go
in a bit.

139
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,380
So, that’s fixed, we’ll meet at six?

140
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,180
Yup, see you in a bit!

141
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:37,939
You can also use the phrase see you in a bit
to say goodbye to someone if you know you’re

142
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,660
going to see them in the near future.

143
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,680
Bad news, Martin.

144
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,719
Oh, what’s that?

145
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,780
I don’t think we’ll have time for that
break.

146
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,000
How come?

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,200
Martin just asked me a question.

148
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,920
Do you remember what he said?

149
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,180
He asked how come?

150
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,719
What is this, and how can you answer it?

151
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,620
Asking how come is like asking why?

152
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,760
The meaning is the same.

153
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,160
However, you can’t use it in every situation.

154
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:30,240
You can use how come to ask why if someone
tells you something surprising, disappointing

155
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,380
or annoying.

156
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,070
Did you hear?

157
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,670
They cancelled the wedding.

158
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,939
No way!

159
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,980
How come?

160
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,190
He didn’t get me anything for my birthday.

161
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,950
Really?

162
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,280
How come?

163
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,230
I have to leave three hours early today.

164
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,660
That’s not easy.

165
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,579
How come?

166
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,190
Well, we have one more useful phrase to look
at.

167
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,780
You’ve finished most of the lesson.

168
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,020
How did you find it?

169
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:13,500
This is another very common question which
is often misunderstood!

170
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,630
How did you find it means what did you think?

171
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:22,010
It’s like asking did you like it?

172
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:27,420
You can use this question to ask about many
different things.

173
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,000
For example:

174
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,630
How did you find the film?

175
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,870
I heard you’ve started aikido lessons.
