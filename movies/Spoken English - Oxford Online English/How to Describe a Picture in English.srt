00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:02,860
HI, I'm Michael.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,199
Welcome to Oxford Online English.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,070
In this lesson, you can learn how to describe
a picture in English.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:18,160
Describing a picture is useful in many English
exams; you need to describe a picture in English

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,660
for exams like FCE, TOEIC or PTE.

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:28,920
It’s also a good way to practise your general
English skills.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,270
Take an interesting picture, and try to describe
it in English.

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,450
You can practise your speaking and learn some
new English vocabulary!

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:43,570
In this lesson, you can learn how to describe
a picture in English in clear, detailed language.

10
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,620
We’ll show you how to build an answer step-by-step.

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,419
What’s the best way to start your description?

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,879
Start with a summary, giving a general description
of what’s in the picture and what you can

13
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:00,879
see.

14
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,910
It’s useful to imagine that the person you’re
talking to can’t see the picture.

15
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,429
Think: what does the other person need to
know?

16
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,310
What do you need to say so that other people
can understand what’s in the picture?

17
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,110
Let’s do an example.

18
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,920
You want to summarize what you see in one
or two simple sentences.

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,280
How could you do that?

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,899
You could say:

21
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:34,990
There are several small boats next to a beach.

22
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,000
Or,
The picture shows a beach, with many small

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,840
boats in the water nearby.

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,759
Simple summaries like this make it easy to
understand the general contents of the picture.

25
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:52,860
Let’s do one more:
What could you say here?

26
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,009
Here are some possible answers:

27
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,329
There are three people cooking in a kitchen.

28
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:03,710
Or,
The picture shows three young friends cooking

29
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,210
together.

30
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,060
Okay, now it’s your turn.

31
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:15,550
Here’s another picture:
You need to make a summary of what you see.

32
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,880
You can use these phrases:

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,500
There is… or,
There are…

34
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,130
The picture shows…

35
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,920
Pause the video, and make one or two sentences.

36
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,190
You can write down your answers if you want.

37
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:40,060
Okay, after your summary, you can start giving
more detail about what you see in the picture.

38
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,020
To start giving detail, you can talk about
where things are in the picture.

39
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,450
Here’s some useful language to help you
do this:

40
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,869
Let’s do an example.

41
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,080
You could say:

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,960
On the left, there’s a girl with dark, curly
hair.

43
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,400
She’s holding half a cauliflower.

44
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,780
In the middle, there’s a man who’s chopping
vegetables.

45
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:13,940
At the bottom, we can see a counter with many
different vegetables on it.

46
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,410
When talking about photos, you might also
need the phrases:

47
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,950
In the background…

48
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,890
In the foreground…

49
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,559
For example:
In the foreground, there’s a sandy beach

50
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,510
with three metal anchors on it.

51
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:37,429
In the middle, there are several small boats,
which are close to the beach.

52
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:42,640
In the background, we can see the blue sea
stretching to the horizon.

53
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,450
Let’s put all of this language together
in another example:

54
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,100
Think first: what could you say about this
picture?

55
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,739
Okay, let’s look at what you could say:

56
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,650
On the left, there’s a cat sitting on a
table.

57
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:10,700
On the right, there’s a man standing, though
we can’t see his face.

58
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:17,899
In the background, we can see blue sky and
snowy mountains.

59
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:18,940
Now it’s your turn!

60
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,000
Here’s a picture:

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,590
Pause the video, and make at least three sentences.

62
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,560
Use the useful language you saw in this section.

63
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,460
Again, you can write your sentences down if
you want to!

64
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,020
Okay?

65
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,140
What’s next?

66
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:46,090
Now, the person you’re talking to should
have a good general idea about what’s in

67
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,219
the picture you’re describing, and where
things are.

68
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,760
Next, you should start describing your picture
in more detail.

69
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:03,120
Let’s look at a picture you’ve seen before:
When adding detail, don’t try to describe

70
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,460
everything in the picture.

71
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,440
It’s not necessary or useful.

72
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,410
You should add details to the most important
parts of the picture.

73
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:18,260
So, for this picture, what do you think the
most important parts are?

74
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:24,900
Probably, the person who took this photo took
it because of the people.

75
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,859
So, you should focus your description on the
two people.

76
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:35,370
Think: what do they look like, and what are
they doing?

77
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,730
You could say:

78
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,180
The two people both look unhappy or irritated.

79
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:46,470
They’re sitting at the kitchen table together,
but they aren’t talking to each other.

80
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:52,070
The man is staring down at the table, while
the woman is stirring her tea with a spoon.

81
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:57,080
That’s just three sentences, but they add
a lot of detail to your description.

82
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,340
Let’s try one more:
In this picture, what do you think you should

83
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,810
focus on in your description?

84
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:10,000
Fairly obviously, you should talk about the
horses.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,690
Let’s try:

86
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,620
The horses are running through the grass.

87
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:22,520
Two of them are black, but the one in the
middle is white and grey.

88
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:29,900
They don’t have saddles or anything, so
they could be wild horses.

89
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:36,299
Again, you can see that you can do a lot with
just a few sentences.

90
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,010
Alright, now it’s your turn!

91
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:45,400
Let’s take a picture you’ve already seen:
Pause the video and make at least three sentences

92
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,979
to describe the picture in detail.

93
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:54,200
Try to include as much information as you
can.

94
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,300
How was that?

95
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,110
If you want more practice, you can do the
same exercise with other pictures from this

96
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,350
lesson, or you could use your own pictures!

97
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,940
At this point, you’ve described the picture
in detail.

98
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,200
So, what else can you do?

99
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,240
Speculating…

100
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,130
What does that mean?

101
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,180
Speculating means talking about possibilities.

102
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:27,900
For example, look at this picture:
Think about some questions:

103
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,799
Why are the umbrellas there?

104
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,980
Who put them there?

105
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:40,389
By trying to answer questions like this, you
are speculating; you’re talking about possibilities

106
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:44,490
and giving your opinion about the picture.

107
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:49,520
Speculating can help you to make a longer,
more detailed answer when talking about a

108
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
picture.

109
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,010
Let’s do an example:

110
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:59,520
I suppose it might be some kind of art project.

111
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,799
Maybe one person put an umbrella up there
as a joke, and then other people started doing

112
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,820
it, too.

113
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,030
Let’s look at one more picture:

114
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:16,340
Think, if you wanted to speculate about this
picture, what could you say?

115
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:22,849
Another way to think about it: what questions
could you ask yourself about this picture?

116
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,550
Possible ideas are: who made the footprints,
and why?

117
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,380
Where were they going?

118
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,510
Where is the person who made the footprints
now?

119
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:39,770
There are other possibilities, of course,
so feel free to use your own ideas, too!

120
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:46,880
Okay, so what could you say to speculate about
this picture?

121
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,890
Here are some examples:

122
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:55,199
The footprints must have been made by a climber
or a mountaineer.

123
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,100
The person who made the footprints might be
standing on top of the mountain now.

124
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,690
In our examples, you’ve seen some useful
language which you can use to speculate about

125
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,690
a picture.

126
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,350
Do you remember?

127
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,190
You can use language like:

128
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,400
I suppose…

129
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,600
Maybe…

130
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,010
[It] must…

131
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,410
[He] might…

132
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:23,240
Let’s practise using these once more with
another picture:

133
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,920
Could you make four sentences, using the useful
language we just saw?

134
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,890
Let’s do an example together:

135
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:39,180
I suppose the guy is a climber, or he’s
on an adventure holiday.

136
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,319
Maybe he climbed something, and now he’s
on the way down.

137
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,500
He must have a lot of experience, because
his body language is quite relaxed.

138
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,750
He might be focusing on what he’s doing,
but he might just be enjoying the view!

139
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,000
Okay, now it’s your turn.

140
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,649
Can you make four sentences to speculate about
this picture, using the language you’ve

141
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:06,880
learned in this section?

142
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,730
Pause the video and think about your answers!

143
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:17,740
Now, you have one more thing to do.

144
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,410
When you speculate, you can speculate about
what you can see in the picture.

145
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:30,230
However, you can—and you should—speculate
about what you can’t see, too.

146
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,410
How’s this possible?

147
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:38,209
Well, think about this picture:
You can think about questions like: where

148
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,240
and when was the picture taken?

149
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,800
Who took the picture?

150
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,310
What was the photographer doing there?

151
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,310
For example:

152
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,279
I think this could be in the USA, or maybe
Russia.

153
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:56,140
It’s a good photo, so perhaps it was taken
by a professional nature photographer.

154
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,720
You see?

155
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,790
Talking about what you can’t see in the
picture can be very useful, and can help to

156
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,900
add details to your answer.

157
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:11,860
Let’s do one more example:
What could you say about this picture?

158
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,960
Let’s do this one together.

159
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,000
You could say:

160
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,920
This must be somewhere tropical, like the
Caribbean or the Maldives.

161
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,899
Perhaps it was taken by a tourist who came
to the beach on one of those boats.

162
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,610
Okay, one more.

163
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,090
This time, you have to do it yourself!

164
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:42,210
Here’s your picture:
Make at least two sentences to speculate about

165
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,680
the context of the picture.

166
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:51,439
Think about where and when it was taken, who
took it, and what the photographer was doing

167
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,990
there.

168
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,430
How was that?

169
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,829
Hopefully you feel more confident describing
pictures in English now.

170
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:04,940
Let’s put everything you’ve learned together
and practise making longer, fluent descriptions.

171
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,260
When you describe a picture, you should:

172
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,780
Give a summary of what you see.

173
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,750
Talk about where things are in the picture.

174
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,320
Add details.

175
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,160
Speculate about what’s in the picture.

176
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,620
And,
Speculate about the context of the picture.

177
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,050
Let’s make a longer answer together.

178
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:34,140
We’ll start with a picture we’ve used
already:

179
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:39,290
Here’s a possible longer answer:

180
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:44,719
In the picture, there are two people sitting
at a table, looking unhappy.

181
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,400
There’s a woman on the left and a man on
the right.

182
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:55,790
In the middle of the picture, we can see some
things on the table, like cups of tea, biscuits,

183
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,829
milk and so on.

184
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:04,100
The two people look sad or irritated, and
they aren’t speaking to each other.

185
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,960
They’re both looking down at the table.

186
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:16,050
I suppose they had a fight and now they aren’t
talking to each other, or they might just

187
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,810
be bored and not have anything to talk about.

188
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:27,060
I guess it’s a stock photo because otherwise,
why would the photographer be in the kitchen

189
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,489
with them?

190
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,690
Do you think you could make an answer like
this?

191
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:37,070
Remember, all the language you need is in
this lesson.

192
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:42,720
You just need to take the things you practised
in each part, and then put them together.

193
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,330
Let’s do one more example together:

194
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,580
The picture shows umbrellas hanging in the
air.

195
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,210
In the foreground, we can see a streetlight,
and the umbrellas fill the picture from left

196
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,160
to right.

197
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,480
The umbrellas are of many different colours,
mostly bright colours like pink, yellow or

198
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
green.

199
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,300
They’re hanging from wires.

200
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,769
I can see at least four lines of umbrellas
hanging down in this way, but there could

201
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:12,680
be even more.

202
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,849
Maybe this is some sort of art project.

203
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,850
It might also be a festival or tradition,
that people decorate the street with colourful

204
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,630
umbrellas like this.

205
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:29,720
I suppose the picture was taken in a city
or town, though I can’t tell where exactly.

206
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,279
Perhaps the photographer was a tourist, and
was just walking around the city when he saw

207
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,899
this amazing and strange scene.

208
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,770
Alright, now it’s your turn.

209
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,899
We’ll give you a new picture:

210
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:47,290
Pause the video and try to make a longer answer,
like we just did.

211
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,000
Follow the same structure.

212
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,290
Finished?

213
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,709
I don’t think so!

214
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:58,229
You should practise as much as you can.

215
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:03,310
Take the other pictures from the lesson, and
make longer answers about them, too.

216
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:09,319
Practise your answers several times, until
you can do it fluently and comfortably.

217
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,209
If you want, you can leave one of your answers
in the comments and we'll give you feedback

218
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:15,689
on your English.
