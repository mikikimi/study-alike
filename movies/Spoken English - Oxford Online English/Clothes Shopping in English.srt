00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,570
Rheedan: Hello my name is Rheedan.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,000
Vicki: Hello, I'm Vicki.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,099
Rheedan: Welcome to Oxford Online English.
In this lesson you can learn about how to

4
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,320
shop for clothing.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,710
Vicki: Have you bought clothing in English
before?

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,960
Rheedan: If not, we hope to change that with
this lesson. And if you have, we want to make

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,410
the next time even easier.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,230
Vicki: Shopping for clothing will give you
a good opportunity to practice your English.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,070
Rheedan: We'll start by showing you a sample
dialogue.

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:41,090
Vicki: Then we'll learn a few phrases that
will help you when you go shopping.

11
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,440
Rheedan: Hello, can I help you?

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,489
Vicki: No, thanks. I'm just browsing.

13
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,020
Rheedan: Okay. Let me know if you need any
help.

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,900
Vicki: Actually do you have any dresses in
stock?

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,720
Rheedan: Yes. Let me show you.

16
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,060
Vicki: I like this one. Do you have it in
another color?

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:07,260
Rheedan: Yes, this dress also comes in red,
blue, black, and green.

18
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,790
Vicki: I'd like to try the blue one, please.

19
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,510
Rheedan: Sure, the changing rooms are over
there.

20
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,470
Vicki: Can I try this in a smaller size?

21
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:24,030
Rheedan: Sorry, we don't have any in stock
left in that color. Would you like to try

22
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,200
another color?

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,240
Vicki: I really like the blue one.

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,390
Rheedan: We have a special offer, buy one
get one free.

25
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,860
Vicki: Really? That's a bargain.

26
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,490
Rheedan: Yes, we have a lot of special deals
on our clothing.

27
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:45,530
Vicki: In that case, I'll take the red one
and the black one.

28
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,909
Rheedan: Would you like anything else?

29
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,159
Vicki: No, thanks. I'll just get this. Can
I pay by card?

30
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,130
Rheedan: Of course, please enter your pin.

31
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,770
Vicki: What is my pin number? Oh, yes.

32
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,630
Rheedan: Please wait one moment. Sign here.

33
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,259
Vicki: Can I get a receipt?

34
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,439
Rheedan: Of course, here you go.

35
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,060
Vicki: Thank you. Have a nice day.

36
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,709
Rheedan: Thanks for shopping with us. Now,
let's look at some of the words you'll need

37
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:20,409
when going clothing shopping.

38
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:26,029
Vicki: When you first enter the clothing store,
the shop assistant might greet you and ask

39
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:32,849
if you need any help. If you are just looking
around, you can say that you are browsing.

40
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:38,469
'Browsing' means looking at many things in
a shop to see if there is something you want

41
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:39,049
to buy.

42
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:46,129
Rheedan: If you're looking for something in
particular, you can ask, "Do you sell jeans?"

43
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:56,010
"Do you have jeans?" "I'm looking for jeans."
"Do you have jeans in stock?" If the shop

44
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:01,129
has the clothing you're looking for, you will
want to try it on before you buy it. You can

45
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:06,029
try on the clothing in the changing room,
a room for trying on clothing.

46
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:12,319
Vicki: After you've tried on the clothing,
you might want to change the size or colour.

47
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:20,638
You can ask, "Do you have this is another
size?" "Do you have this in a size eight?"

48
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:29,829
"Do you have this is another colour?" "Do
you have this in green?" You've tried on the

49
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:36,769
clothing, it's the right size and the right
colour, now you want to know how much it costs.

50
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:44,579
If you're buying one item, you can ask, "How
much is this?" If you're buying more than

51
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:52,870
one item, you can ask, "How much are these?"
If the clothing costs a lot of money, you

52
00:03:52,870 --> 00:04:01,069
can say, "That's really expensive." If the
clothing isn't expensive, you can say, "That's

53
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:08,879
really cheap," or, "That's a bargain." If
you choose to buy the clothing, you can say,

54
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,980
"I'll take them," or, "I'll take it."

55
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,779
Rheedan: Once you've finished shopping and
are getting ready to pay, the shop assistant

56
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:26,210
might ask you, "Will there be anything else?"
"Can I help with anything else?" They will

57
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:33,830
ask if you want to pay with cash or by card.
Usually they'll just say, "Cash or card?"

58
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:42,150
Vicki: You can answer, "I'll pay by card,"
or, "I'll pay by cash." Don't forget to get

59
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:50,138
a receipt. Say, "Could I have a receipt please?"
I hope these phrases help you the next time

60
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:51,539
you're shopping.

61
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:55,159
Rheedan: That's the end of the lesson. Thank
you for joining us!
