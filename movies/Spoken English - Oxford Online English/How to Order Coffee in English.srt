Hi. My name is Rheedan. Welcome to Oxford
Online English! Today, we're going to learn

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:13,300
some important words and phrases, so that
you can order your next cup of coffee in English.

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,930
Do you often go for coffee? Do you know how
to order different types of coffee in English?

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,180
You'll learn how in this lesson. Let's first
look at some words you'll need to know when

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,060
ordering your morning cup.

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,080
At a coffee shop, drinks are usually made
from espresso. An espresso is a small amount

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:35,190
of very strong coffee. This small amount is
called a shot. This espresso is then drunk

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,110
on its own or mixed in different ways to make
the different coffee drinks. Here are some

9
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:47,899
of the most common. Americano: espresso with
hot water. Cappuccino: espresso and steamed

10
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:56,500
milk, with foamed milk or cream on top. Latte:
espresso with lots of steamed milk. Mocha:

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,859
espresso, hot chocolate, and steamed milk,
sometimes with cream on top.

12
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,860
Which of these types of coffee have you tried?
Personally, I like lattes. You can also have

13
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:13,500
your coffee with different kinds of milk,
like low-fat, fat-free, or soy. If you want

14
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,810
coffee without milk, ask for a black coffee.
Some people also like to have things added

15
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,830
to their coffee, like caramel, chocolate,
or vanilla syrup, or cream. You can even have

16
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,140
an extra shot of espresso added. You also
have a choice of sizes. You can get a small,

17
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:39,470
medium, large, or extra large. Many coffee
shops have their own names for these sizes,

18
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,170
but you don't need to know or use them. Just
using these sizes will work.

19
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:50,079
How to order coffee: when giving your order,
you usually say the size first, then the type

20
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,429
of coffee, and then the type of milk or extras.
For example, "Small cappuccino with caramel

21
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:04,229
syrup" or, "Medium mocha without cream." If
you want a cold drink, you add the word "iced"

22
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:11,170
before the type of coffee. For example, "Large
iced latte with low-fat milk" or, "Medium

23
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,738
iced Americano."

24
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:17,709
Placing your order: a barista is someone who
makes coffee. They will usually take your

25
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:24,879
order. There are a few things they can say,
such as, "May I take your order?" "What would

26
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:31,649
you like?" "What can I get you?" "What will
you have?" You can answer in a few different

27
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:39,200
ways. You can say, "I would like . . ." "I'll
have . . ." or, "Can I get . . .?" Then you

28
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,040
give your order: "I'll have an Americano with
vanilla syrup." Or, "Can I get a latte with

29
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,910
extra cream, please?"

30
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,400
What's this order missing? If you make an
order like this, the first question you will

31
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,550
be asked is, "What size would you like?" "What
size will that be?" Another question you might

32
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:04,670
hear when making your order is, "Is that for
here or to take away?" You can answer, "For

33
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:11,260
here," "To take away," or, "To go." You can
also add this information to your order. What

34
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,989
does that look like? When you order, you can
just say, "I'd like a small mocha without

35
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:22,550
cream to go," or, "I'll have a medium iced
latte with vanilla syrup, for here."

36
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:29,950
After you order, the barista might say, "Will
that be all?" "Is that everything?" "Would

37
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:36,349
you like anything else?" Finally, the barista
will tell you the total cost. "Your total

38
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:42,980
is . . ." "That comes to . . ." "That will
be . . ." When handing over your money, you

39
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:50,010
can say, "Here you are," or, "Here you go."
Once you've paid, you'll both say, "Thank

40
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,000
you," and that's it. You've just successfully
ordered coffee in English.

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,659
Let's look at a sample dialogue. "Hi. What'll
you have?" "I"d like a large latte." "Will

42
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:07,769
that be all?" "Yes, thank you." "Is that for
here? Or to go?" "To go." "Your total comes

43
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:14,010
to $4." "Here you go." "Thanks very much."
"Thank you. Have a nice day."

44
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:20,719
Let's look at one more. "Hi. What can I get
you?" "I'll have a small mocha with cream

45
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,090
and a small cappuccino, for here." "Would
you like anything else?" "Yes, I'd also like

46
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:32,880
an espresso." "Is that everything?" "Yes."
"That will be six pounds." "Here you go."

47
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,000
"Here's your change." "Thanks." "Thanks very
much." There you go. Now you'll be able to

48
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,590
order your next cup of coffee in English.

49
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:47,530
