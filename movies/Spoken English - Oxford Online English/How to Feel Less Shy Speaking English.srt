00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:09,240
Hello. I'm Oli. Welcome to Oxford Online English.
In this lesson, you can learn about dealing

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,520
with shyness or nervousness when you speak
English. Do you sometimes feel shy when you

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:23,859
speak English? Is it worse when you speak
to native speakers? Do these feelings of shyness

4
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:31,929
or nervousness stop you from practicing and
using your English? Yes? Yes? And yes? This

5
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:35,920
video could hopefully help you.

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,960
Shyness and nervousness are natural, but they
also make it more difficult to speak. If you

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,989
feel shy, you might not be able to think of
things to say, or you might not be able to

8
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:55,739
use grammar and vocabulary correctly. Some
English learners get stuck in a pattern where

9
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:02,828
they feel shy, and so they avoid using English
or speaking English. Now I can't promise to

10
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,790
solve all of your problems with shyness and
nervousness. But in this video, I'll share

11
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:13,350
some advice on how to deal with these feelings,
which I hope will be helpful.

12
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:23,470
Point one, remember that speaking is just
speaking. What do I mean? Well, when we first

13
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:28,830
hear foreign languages or meet foreigners,
they often sound very strange or interesting

14
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:36,619
or exotic to us. Oh, he's speaking French.
Wow! He must be saying something romantic,

15
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:42,700
or he must be talking about literature or
philosophy. I wish I could understand him.

16
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:49,770
Oh, wow! She's writing in Chinese. Those characters,
they're so beautiful. She must be writing

17
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,908
a poem. I wish I could understand what she's
writing.

18
00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:00,280
Yeah, you know what? Maybe the French guy
is talking about philosophy. Maybe he's just

19
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,500
talking about how he got stuck in a traffic
jam. Maybe the Chinese girl is writing a poem

20
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:14,450
about misty mountains, or maybe it's just
a shopping list. If you think that foreign

21
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,149
languages and foreign people are something
strange or exotic, of course, you'll feel

22
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:25,060
more nervous when you're speaking. I think
many English learners have this idea. They

23
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:32,540
think, "Oh, I'm not talking to a person. I'm
talking to a native speaker."

24
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:38,629
But actually, speaking English isn't something
special. It's just speaking, like you do all

25
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:46,149
day, every day. All over the world, most of
what people talk about is quite simple, and

26
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,769
it's quite similar all over the world. Native
English speakers aren't different animals.

27
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:57,980
They're just normal people. They talk about
their work. They complain about their bosses.

28
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,159
They talk about movies they've seen. They
decide what they're going to have for lunch

29
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:09,409
and so on, just like anybody else. So don't
think that native speakers are some kind of

30
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:16,420
magical animal. They're not. If you want to
talk to them, talk to them. If you don't,

31
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:25,540
don't. It's not such a big deal either way.
What? Not a big deal? Really? Yeah, really.

32
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:33,620
You need to ask yourself, part two, "What's
the worst that could happen?" So you feel

33
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:40,379
really nervous about speaking English. One
day, you find the courage, you go and talk

34
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:47,159
to a teacher at your school, maybe a British
person or an American person. It goes horribly

35
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:54,899
badly. You feel really uncomfortable. You
can't think of anything to say. So you walk

36
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:05,650
away, and you think thoughts like, "I've embarrassed
myself. I feel like an idiot. Why is my English

37
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:15,099
so bad?" Here's a question though. What have
you actually lost? Nothing.

38
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:22,530
It's not a big deal. It's just a conversation.
The big deal is only in your head. You think

39
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:29,119
these thoughts. Nobody else. 10 years in the
future, are you still going to be thinking

40
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,210
and worrying about that time when, "Oh, I
tried to start a conversation, and it didn't

41
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:42,120
go very well."? No, of course not. Why not?
Because it's not that important. Maybe it

42
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,630
feels like a big deal. It feels important
at that moment, but it's not really important.

43
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:56,219
You haven't lost anything. You may feel embarrassed,
or you may feel stupid, but you're doing that

44
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:03,750
to yourself. There's no reason why. No one
else is telling you you're stupid. You aren't

45
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:11,190
risking anything, just by starting a conversation.
I guarantee the person you talk to is not

46
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,990
thinking these thoughts.

47
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,889
So what can you do about these feelings? How
can you control them? Well, let's look at

48
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:28,970
point three: wear a mask. These feelings of
nervousness or shyness are all inside. Here's

49
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:36,300
the best piece of advice I can give you. Just
because you feel nervous, you don't have to

50
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:45,139
act nervous. Let me tell you a story. Before
I started teaching, I was terrified of public

51
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:51,509
speaking. Even speaking in front of very small
groups made me feel very nervous and very,

52
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:52,949
very stressed.

53
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:58,990
The first lesson I ever taught was to a group
of maybe eight Russian teenagers, just a small

54
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:05,910
class. It was the most scared I've ever been
in my life. That's not an exaggeration. I

55
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:12,120
have quite seriously never felt so much fear.
I was shaking. I was sweating. I couldn't

56
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,340
remember anything about my lesson. I tried
to teach something about modal verbs. I don't

57
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,679
think anybody learned anything.

58
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,729
Afterwards, I thought, "How am I going to
do this?" My trainer gave me the same advice

59
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:34,090
I'm giving you. Act confident, even if you
don't feel confident. So I did. The first

60
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:41,198
few months, I still felt really nervous, but
I tried to hide it. After maybe a year, I

61
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:48,060
didn't feel so nervous. After a few years,
I could stand in front of 100 people and expect

62
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:54,710
their attention, even if I still felt a little
bit nervous inside. If it worked for me, it

63
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:02,440
can work for you. Sure, it takes time, and
it's not easy, but it's possible. So act confident.

64
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:09,110
Hold your head up. Chin up. Make eye contact,
even if it makes you uncomfortable. Control

65
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:15,919
the speed and the rhythm of your voice. Doing
these things is not so difficult, and it will

66
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,180
make you feel good because you're taking control
of your feelings, instead of letting your

67
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,740
feelings control you.
OK, you think, "Easy for you, Oli. You're

68
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,009
talking about speaking your own language.
We're talking about speaking a foreign language."

69
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:42,560
OK, let's talk about that. Point four: worrying
about your language makes your language worse.

70
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,190
Here's a question: when you hear a foreigner
speak your language, how do you decide if

71
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:56,020
this person is speaking well or badly? In
most cases, people notice your fluency and

72
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:02,508
your pronunciation. In speech, people don't
pay much attention to grammar and vocabulary

73
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:06,360
if your speech is easy to understand.

74
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,190
What does this mean? It means that if you
are embarrassed of your grammar or your vocabulary

75
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:18,500
when you're speaking English, you really shouldn't
be. First of all, worrying doesn't solve anything

76
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,020
anyway. If your grammar is bad, worrying about
your grammar will not make it better. The

77
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:31,909
only result is that you will feel bad. That's
it. Secondly, other people will really not

78
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:38,060
notice your grammar or vocabulary very much.
Most people don't care about these things,

79
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:43,439
most people who aren't English teachers. Even
English teachers care about these things at

80
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,140
work, and then they stop caring after work.

81
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,640
Trust me. If I've been teaching all day, and
you come and talk to me, I do not want to

82
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,269
think about your grammar or your vocabulary
problems. That's the last thing I want to

83
00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:04,360
do at the end of the day. Most teachers I
know feel the same way. Most importantly,

84
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,550
worrying about your grammar and vocabulary
will affect your fluency. You'll speak slowly,

85
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,660
and you'll hesitate more if you're always
worrying about which verb form should I use

86
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,990
or what's the right word here.

87
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:23,290
So if you're just having a chat with someone,
don't think about your English too much. It

88
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,380
doesn't help. It doesn't make your English
better, and it doesn't make it easier to communicate.

89
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,980
Just talk. Try to communicate your ideas.
You'll sound more confident because you're

90
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:40,050
not hesitating and worrying about your language.
If you sound more confident, hopefully you'll

91
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,310
feel more confident too.

92
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:48,849
OK, let's review and put the things we've
talked about together. Part five, break the

93
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:57,990
habit sooner, not later. You can't help feeling
shy or nervous, but you can help how you respond

94
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:05,680
to these feelings. Very often, our responses
to our feelings are habits. They're habits

95
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,130
which are difficult to break, but not impossible.
Every time you want to talk to someone in

96
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:19,140
English, but you choose not to, you're feeding
your bad habits. Every time you think to yourself,

97
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:26,439
"My grammar sucks. I don't have anything interesting
to say," you're feeding these bad habits.

98
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,750
So go and talk to someone, even if it makes
you feel uncomfortable. The first time, it

99
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:38,860
might not go so well. That's okay. The 10th
time, it will be easier. The 100th time, it

100
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,630
will be much easier. You won't even remember
how difficult it was at the beginning. You

101
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:50,620
don't have anything interesting to say? Fine.
Say something boring. No one expects you to

102
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:57,010
be interesting all the time. No one's interesting
all the time. Just say something boring. End

103
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:02,200
the conversation. Most conversations are simple.
It doesn't matter that much what you say.

104
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:09,250
Worried about your grammar or your vocabulary?
Remember, no one else really cares that much.

105
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,620
Just focus on trying to communicate. Talk.
Express your ideas. When you're having a conversation

106
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,060
with someone, these things are much more important.

107
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:24,268
Most importantly, stop feeding bad habits.
Go talk to people, even if you're uncomfortable.

108
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:29,430
You'll learn quite quickly that feeling shy
or feeling nervous will only stop you speaking

109
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:35,489
English if you let it. OK, that's the end
of the lesson. I hope you found it useful.
