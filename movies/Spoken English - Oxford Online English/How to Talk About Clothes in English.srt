00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:04,160
Hi, I’m Justin.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,830
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,840
In this lesson, you can learn how to talk
about clothes and fashion in English.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,139
Can you describe the clothes you like to wear
in detail?

5
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:18,790
Do you know how to compliment someone on their
style?

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,990
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do these
things and more.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:31,380
Let’s start with the basics: what are you
wearing right now?

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,980
Hello, Molotov Fashions, how can I help?

9
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:35,990
Hi!

10
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,870
Yeah, I made an order online, but there’s
a problem with it.

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,269
I’m sorry to hear that.

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,250
What’s the problem exactly?

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,970
I ordered a floral-print silk scarf, but you’ve
sent me a patterned wool scarf instead.

14
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,690
I’m sorry to hear that.

15
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,290
What was your order number?

16
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,060
5633BQ
Let me see…

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,280
Yes, I see it now.

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,790
So, you can return the silk scarf using the
label you received in your package.

19
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,640
I see you also ordered a striped cotton top.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,520
Did that arrive okay?

21
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,119
Actually, no!

22
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,000
You sent me a plain denim shirt.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,670
Oh, I am sorry!

24
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,320
We really messed that up.

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,919
So, you can return those two items, and we’ll
send out your leather jacket and your velour

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,710
tracksuit.

27
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,759
Leather jacket?!

28
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,810
Velour?!

29
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,040
What are you talking about?

30
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,560
Look, maybe I’ll just return the items for
a refund.

31
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,560
Of course.

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,330
I’m sorry, our computer systems are a little
unreliable.

33
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,920
You don’t say.

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,880
In this dialogue, you heard different words
to describe patterns and materials.

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,199
Can you remember any?

36
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,750
You saw these words for patterns:

37
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,840
floral-print
patterned

38
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,960
striped
And: plain

39
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,279
There’s one common pattern which is missing.

40
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,180
Do you know it?

41
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:12,680
You could also have check clothing, for example
a check shirt.

42
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,299
You can say check or checked—the meaning
is the same.

43
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:20,739
You can use print with many different things.

44
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:26,680
For example, you could have a fruit-print
dress, or an eagle-print T-shirt.

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,200
You can use patterned for any clothing which
has some kind of pattern which doesn’t fit

46
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,469
any of the other words.

47
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:36,109
What about materials?

48
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,599
Can you remember the words from the dialogue?

49
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,798
You heard these words for materials:

50
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:44,180
silk
wool

51
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,529
cotton
denim

52
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:50,590
leather
And: velour

53
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,599
Velour is a kind of soft material.

54
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,018
It’s not so common.

55
00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:00,510
If you’re talking about clothes and you
want to describe the pattern and the material,

56
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,209
put the pattern first.

57
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:04,629
For example:

58
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:10,019
a floral-print silk scarf
a plain denim shirt

59
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,560
Or: a striped cotton top

60
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,760
Now, it’s your turn to practice!

61
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,719
Pause the video and make three sentences to
describe your clothing.

62
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:24,400
Include the pattern and the material.

63
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,599
You can say your sentences out loud, or write
them down.

64
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,988
Ready?

65
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:36,150
Let’s move on.

66
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,780
So, what do you think?

67
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,339
It’s okay, but it’s a little loose, and
the sleeves aren’t long enough.

68
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,000
Would you like to try a smaller size?

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,840
But then the sleeves will be even shorter!

70
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:54,089
I think I need to try something else.

71
00:03:54,089 --> 00:03:55,689
How’s that one?

72
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:57,290
It looks like a good fit to me!

73
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,290
Hmm…

74
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,659
It’s a little tight around the shoulders.

75
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,179
I think it goes well with your shoes.

76
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,209
Did I mention that we have a 20% discount
today?

77
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:07,339
I’m not sure about the style, either.

78
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:10,019
It’s a little too hipster for me.

79
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,699
Would you like to try something else?

80
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:13,419
No, I don’t think so.

81
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,249
Thanks for your all help.

82
00:04:15,249 --> 00:04:21,339
When you buy new clothes, of course you want
them to fit well and look good.

83
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:24,539
But, sometimes they don’t fit well.

84
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,280
They might be too tight or too loose.

85
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,570
Maybe it’s just too big or small in one
place.

86
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,050
Then, you could say something like:

87
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,140
It’s tight around the shoulders.

88
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,680
Or: It’s too big around the waist.

89
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,010
Notice how you say the shoulders and not my
shoulders.

90
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,250
What other problems could you have with how
clothes fit?

91
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,410
Do you remember what happened in the dialogue?

92
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,920
You could also say:

93
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,010
The sleeves aren’t long enough.

94
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,599
Or: The collar is too tight.

95
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,720
Useful words here are too and enough.

96
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,010
You can use them to express similar ideas,
like this:

97
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,730
The sleeves aren’t long enough.

98
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,780
Or: The sleeves are too short.

99
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:20,690
With these phrases, you can talk about fit,
but what about style?

100
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,120
If something doesn’t match your personal
tastes, you could say something like:

101
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,900
It’s too casual for me.

102
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,080
It’s too old-fashioned for me.

103
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,950
Or: It’s too fancy for me.

104
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:40,260
When the shop assistant in the dialogue was
trying to persuade me to buy something, he

105
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,260
said:

106
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,430
It goes well with your shoes.

107
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:49,220
This is one way to say that something looks
good on someone.

108
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,320
You could also say something like:

109
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,830
It suits you.

110
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,219
Or: It matches your eyes.

111
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,580
We have a question for you: what’s your
personal style?

112
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,659
Do you prefer smart clothes, or casual?

113
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,940
Plain, or colourful?

114
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,650
Let us know in the comments!

115
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:18,270
Next, let’s look at some more ways to compliment
someone on their clothing.

116
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,150
Is that a new shirt?

117
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,150
Yeah!

118
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,150
Do you like it?

119
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,150
I do!

120
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,150
It looks good on you.

121
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,150
Thanks!

122
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,929
It makes you look much slimmer.

123
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,030
What do you mean?

124
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,030
I mean…

125
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,030
I just…

126
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,940
I like the fit; that’s what I meant to say.

127
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,940
Hmm.

128
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,790
Don’t be so moody!

129
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,740
You look very smart.

130
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,570
You should wear smart clothes more often.

131
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,219
It’s a good look for you!

132
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,800
I’ll try to find more clothes that make
me look slimmer, then.

133
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,480
Oh, don’t be ridiculous.

134
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:54,800
So, if you want to compliment someone on their
clothes, what can you say?

135
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,180
You can use phrases you heard before, like
it suits you, but in the dialogue you heard

136
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,170
some more phrases, such as:

137
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,510
That looks good on you!

138
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:08,510
Or: It’s a good look for you.

139
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,710
You could also comment on a particular aspect
of the clothing:

140
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,500
I like the fit!

141
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,460
I like the style!

142
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,960
Or: I like the colours!

143
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,590
You can also make a more personal compliment,
like this:

144
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,549
It makes you look slimmer.

145
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,990
Or: You look very smart.

146
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,840
You can use these phrases in different ways.

147
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,840
For example:

148
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,560
It makes you look younger.

149
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,920
Or: You look very elegant.

150
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:44,640
Now, you can describe clothes in detail, talk
about the fit and style of clothes, and compliment

151
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,260
people on their clothes in English.

152
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:53,840
There’s one more thing we have to show you.

153
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,979
Are you ready?

154
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,810
Don’t tell me you’re going like that!

155
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,470
What do you mean?

156
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,139
It’s a formal event.

157
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:01,680
You need to dress up.

158
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,889
Go get changed!

159
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:04,710
This okay?

160
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,710
No!

161
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,340
You need to put on a tie.

162
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,900
And take off those awful shoes.

163
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,030
But these are the only shoes I have!

164
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,260
You are a nightmare!

165
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,920
Well, we have just about enough time.

166
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,580
We’ll stop at the shop on the way and buy
you some black shoes.

167
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,240
What if they don’t fit?

168
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,020
I need time to try them on before I buy them.

169
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,450
You should have thought about that earlier.

170
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,299
There are many phrasal verbs connected with
clothing.

171
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:37,098
Can you remember the ones you heard in the
dialogue?

172
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,269
There are simple verbs, like put on and…

173
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,000
Wait, what’s the opposite?

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,579
Did you say put off?

175
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:45,910
We hope not!

176
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,139
The opposite of put on is take off.

177
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:55,190
If you need to put on some different clothes,
then you need to get changed.

178
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:00,570
There are other verb phrases with get, like
get dressed or get undressed.
