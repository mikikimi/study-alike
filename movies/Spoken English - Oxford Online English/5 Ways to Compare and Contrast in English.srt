00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,010
Hi, I’m Maria.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,529
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:10,370
In this lesson, you can learn how to compare
and contrast things in English.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:16,259
When you compare two—or more—things, you
need to talk about similarities and differences

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,000
between them.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,040
This is a very global skill; it could be useful
in spoken English, or in writing.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,669
In this lesson, you’ll learn different language
you can use to talk about how similar or different

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,009
two things are.

9
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,239
We’ll cover many different topics, to show
you different ways to use your new language.

10
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:41,919
Let’s start by seeing how you can talk about
big differences.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,000
Our topic for this section is travel.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,400
So, you went to Vietnam and Laos, right?

13
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:51,409
What did you think?

14
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:54,329
They were both great, but totally different.

15
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,469
It’s hard to compare them.

16
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:01,390
It’s strange, really, because they’re
so close geographically, but in other ways

17
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,800
they’re almost nothing alike.

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,970
What was the biggest difference?

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,860
I’d say the pace of life.

20
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,980
In Vietnam everything moves so much faster.

21
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,750
Laos is way more relaxed.

22
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,980
Which did you like better?

23
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,930
It’s hard to say.

24
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,110
I liked them both, but for different reasons.

25
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,430
In this short dialogue, you saw five phrases
you can use to talk about two things which

26
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,390
are very different.

27
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,970
Do you remember what they were?

28
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,929
If two things are very different, you can
say:

29
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,890
They’re totally different.

30
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,450
It’s hard to compare them.

31
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,660
They’re almost nothing alike.

32
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,640
These are fixed phrases, but you can adapt
them to express different ideas.

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,640
For example:

34
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,690
They’re so different.

35
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,250
It’s impossible to compare them.

36
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,680
They’re nothing alike.

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,710
You can also use a comparative adjective or
adverb.

38
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,929
For example, in the dialogue, you heard:

39
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,600
Everything moves so much faster.

40
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,519
Laos is way more relaxed.

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,959
Before a comparative, you can add an intensifier
like much, so much, or way to show that you’re

42
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,959
talking about a big difference.

43
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,599
Using way is more conversational.

44
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:27,349
You can use these in many different situations;
for example:

45
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:32,030
Lisbon is much cheaper than most European
cities.

46
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,770
The museum was so much more interesting than
I expected.

47
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,040
Shanghai is way bigger than anywhere I’ve
been before.

48
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:49,530
There’s a common mistake which English learners
often make here with much and more.

49
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,890
If you need more, it’s part of the comparative,
like more interesting.

50
00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:00,730
If you add much, it adds emphasis and shows
that you’re talking about a large difference.

51
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,328
Don’t say things like:

52
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:07,160
Tokyo is much expensive than other Asian cities.

53
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,819
The food in Mexico was much more cheaper than
in the States.

54
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:15,369
Can you correct these sentences?

55
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,349
Tokyo is much more expensive than other Asian
cities.

56
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:25,339
The food in Mexico was much cheaper than in
the States.

57
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,989
These are common mistakes, so be careful!

58
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:33,139
Now, let’s see how you can talk about things
which are very similar.

59
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:40,249
In this section, we’re going to talk about
describing people.

60
00:03:40,249 --> 00:03:41,400
Have you met his brother?

61
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Yeah!

62
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,709
They’re so alike; I could hardly tell them
apart!

63
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:47,609
I kept mixing up their names.

64
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:48,950
I know!

65
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,958
It’s weird, right?

66
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,029
They could be twins.

67
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:57,319
It’s funny because they look so similar,
and they seem to have the same personality,

68
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,409
too.

69
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:01,090
Equally chatty, equally funny…

70
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,430
His brother is just as sarcastic as he is,
too.

71
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,040
Yeah, true.

72
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,829
Again, you heard five phrases to describe
people who are very similar.

73
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,370
Do you remember them?

74
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:18,130
If you want to find them yourself, you can
go back and listen to the dialogue again.

75
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,190
Try to write them down.

76
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,090
If two people are very similar, you could
say:

77
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,229
They’re so alike.

78
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:26,919
I can hardly tell them apart.

79
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:28,889
They look so similar.

80
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:30,419
They’re equally chatty.

81
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:34,650
He’s just as sarcastic as his brother.

82
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,669
Of course, you can adapt these phrases; for
example:

83
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:41,840
The way they talk is so similar.

84
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,119
They’re equally funny.

85
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,220
She’s just as impatient as her mother.

86
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:54,730
Here’s a task for you: can you think of
two people you know who are very similar?

87
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,620
Write down three sentences to describe them,
using the language you just saw.

88
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,880
Pause the video and do it now!

89
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,550
You’ve seen how to use this language to
talk about people, but you can use the same

90
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,310
phrases to talk about many different things;
for example:

91
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,600
I can hardly tell these two wines apart.

92
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,909
I hated both cities; they’re equally terrible.

93
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:24,300
Playing golf is just as boring as watching
it.

94
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,560
Next, you’re going to see how to talk about
small differences.

95
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,590
Our topic for the next section?

96
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:34,840
Sports!

97
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,179
Good game, right?

98
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,159
Yeah, it was.

99
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,650
They played a bit better than last week, I
thought.

100
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,650
Yup.

101
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,060
They were just a little sharper in those key
moments.

102
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,139
I thought the keeper did slightly better,
too.

103
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:52,520
He wasn’t quite as hesitant as he was last
week, and you could see the defence looked

104
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,120
more solid.

105
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,229
They looked good going forward, too.

106
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,729
They were just a touch faster moving the ball
around.

107
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:00,938
True.

108
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,169
They weren’t doing that last week.

109
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:08,490
Again, you heard five phrases to talk about
small differences.

110
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,909
Can you remember them?

111
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:17,080
Again, you can review the dialogue and write
them down if you want to find them yourself.

112
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,400
When talking about small differences, you
can use a modifier plus a comparative adjective

113
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,030
or adverb, like this:

114
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,950
They played a bit better.

115
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,000
They were just a little sharper.

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,539
The keeper did slightly better.

117
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:38,669
They were a touch faster.

118
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:44,170
You can also use quite as… as… to show
that two things are slightly different, like

119
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,170
this:

120
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:50,520
He wasn’t quite as hesitant as he was last
week.

121
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,549
In the dialogue, we were talking about a football
match that we both saw, but you can use these

122
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,050
phrases and structures to talk about many
different topics.

123
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,580
For example:

124
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,628
Taking the train will be a bit faster.

125
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:04,990
She’s a little older than her husband.

126
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:10,240
This isn’t quite as spicy as the last time
you made it.

127
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,540
Let’s look at one more topic.

128
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:18,789
In the next section, we’re going to talk
about food.

129
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:20,270
What did you think?

130
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,508
It was tasty, but the dishes didn’t vary
much.

131
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,460
Everything tasted much the same.

132
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,820
Yeah, I know what you mean.

133
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,969
Did you try the shrimp?

134
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,800
Yeah.

135
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,440
That was probably the best, but the main dishes
were all pretty similar.

136
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,180
Tomato, sweet, slightly spicy…

137
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,980
Maybe we just didn’t order the right things.

138
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,080
I don’t think it’s that.

139
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,068
I’ve been there before, and it was more
or less like tonight.

140
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:49,490
It was a bit disappointing, especially for
the price.

141
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,100
It was nearly as expensive as that Japanese
place we went to for my birthday!

142
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,819
Yeah, I know.

143
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:58,110
Let’s not go back.

144
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:03,919
Here, we were talking about a bad restaurant,
where everything tasted almost the same.

145
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:10,539
Of course, talking about close similarities
is similar to talking about minor differences.

146
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:13,240
The only difference is your focus.

147
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,949
If two things are slightly different, you
can use different language depending on whether

148
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:23,479
you want to focus on the differences or on the similarities.

149
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,758
In this dialogue, you heard five phrases to
describe slight similarities.

150
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,169
Can you remember them?

151
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:32,289
You heard:

152
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,559
The dishes didn’t vary much.

153
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,069
Everything tasted much the same.

154
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,940
The main dishes were all pretty similar.

155
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,280
It was more or less like tonight.

156
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:49,079
It was nearly as expensive as that Japanese
place we went to for my birthday.

157
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,010
Of course, you can adapt these phrases to
talk about different things; for example:

158
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,610
Apartments here don’t vary much.

159
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,380
You can do it today or tomorrow—it’s much
the same to me.

160
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:07,320
A lot of small towns in the UK are pretty
similar.

161
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,620
There are different versions of rugby, but
the basic idea is more or less the same.

162
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,200
My nephew is almost as tall as me now!

163
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,050
Now, you should know how to talk about differences
and similarities in different ways.

164
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:30,310
Let’s see how you can put everything you’ve
learned together.

165
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:36,180
Of course, when you’re speaking or writing
naturally, you don’t necessarily want to

166
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,439
talk about only big differences, or only similarities.

167
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,240
You may need to use a range of different language.

168
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,510
You’re going to see two longer answers on
different topics, using a range of language

169
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,000
from this lesson.

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,240
First, let’s see an answer comparing two
cities: Moscow and St Petersburg:

171
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,589
If you visit Russia, you should definitely
visit both Moscow and St Petersburg.

172
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:06,690
They’re completely different cities.

173
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:13,510
St Petersburg feels much more European than
Moscow, while Moscow is a bit grittier, but

174
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,839
very interesting.

175
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:22,310
Things like accommodation, food, transport
and so on are much the same in both places.

176
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:30,029
It’s slightly easier to find a cheaper place
to stay in St Petersburg, but Moscow has a

177
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,050
bit more variety when it comes to eating out.

178
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:38,930
To get around, take the metro, which is just
as efficient in both cities.

179
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,979
Have you been to Moscow or St Petersburg?

180
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,310
What would you add to our description?

181
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,319
You can let us know in the comments!

182
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,399
Let’s look at one more longer example.

183
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:55,760
This time, we’re going to compare working
at home with working in an office.

184
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,939
It’s hard to compare working at home and
working in an office.

185
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,769
People think that working at home would be
much more relaxing, but that’s not always

186
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:07,370
true.

187
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:12,550
You still have to do just as much work, so
it can be equally stressful.

188
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,140
Of course, you have slightly more freedom
to plan your own day, but you also have to

189
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:23,260
be a bit more responsible, because otherwise
you end up wasting a lot of time.

190
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:28,630
In the end, you save time commuting, but most
people waste a little more time, so you spend

191
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:34,350
nearly as much time working as if you just
went to work.

192
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,899
Can you see how this answer uses different
phrases and structures from the lesson to

193
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,610
compare these two points?

194
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,880
What do you think about this topic?

195
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,050
Would you prefer to work at home, or work
in an office?

196
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,430
Let us know in the comments.

197
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,829
Finally, could you make a longer answer like
this?

198
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:59,279
You could compare two cities you’ve visited,
two different cuisines, two people you know,

199
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,470
or something else.

200
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,649
You can use this language to talk about almost
anything!
