00:00:01,849 --> 00:00:07,740
Hi, I’m Oli. Welcome to Oxford Online English!
In this lesson, you can learn how to speak

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,600
more fluently in English.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,279
How long have you been studying English? Do
you find that sometimes that even though you

4
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:21,860
study hard, you can’t speak fluently? Do
you learn lots of grammar and vocabulary,

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,150
but you find it difficult to make sentences
when you speak.

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,520
In this lesson, we’re going to talk about
fluency and what you can do to change this

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,390
situation and improve your English fluency.

8
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,940
Part one: what is fluency?

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,449
Sometimes, when people talk about fluency,
they just mean speaking a language well. For

10
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:51,960
some people, speaking English fluently just
means having a good general level of English.

11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,629
However, fluency is more specific than that.
Fluency means you can speak smoothly, without

12
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:00,419
stopping or hesitating.

13
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,000
There are two sides to fluency. One side is
physical: your mouth needs to produce and

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,960
connect English sounds and words in a fast,
smooth way.

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,020
The other side of fluency is mental: your
brain needs to find the right words and build

16
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,479
English sentences quickly and smoothly.

17
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,789
To improve your fluency, you need to work
on both sides: physical and mental.

18
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:27,450
But first…

19
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,359
Part two: rule number one: get out there!

20
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:37,649
There are many things you can do to improve
your English fluency.

21
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:44,789
However, if you want to become more fluent,
there’s really one thing you have to do.

22
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:50,930
Get out there and speak English. Talk to people
and have conversations regularly. Nothing

23
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,120
else you can do is as important as this.

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:01,670
Reading English will improve your reading.
Practicing listening will improve your listening.

25
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:09,119
But what about speaking? Nothing will help
your speaking except speaking.

26
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,890
Speaking English is a practical skill. It’s
not an academic subject; it’s not something

27
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,760
you can learn from a book.

28
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,750
It’s more like doing a sport or playing
a musical instrument: you need to practice

29
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,830
regularly to make any progress.

30
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,110
How regularly? As often as you can!

31
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:34,330
There’s no maximum, but I’d recommend
you need to spend at least 2-3 hours a week

32
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,870
speaking English if you want to improve.

33
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,640
So, how can you do this?

34
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:48,149
Go to classes, talk to expats in your city,
join groups or activities with English-speakers,

35
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:53,920
find a conversation partner online, do a language
exchange; there are many possibilities!

36
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,600
By the way, what you do doesn’t have to
be language-focused. You can go to English

37
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,290
classes to practice your speaking, but anything
you do which is in English and which will

38
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,590
make you speak English is just as good.

39
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:15,040
I’m going to take a guess here about what
many of you are thinking right now: “But

40
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:22,380
I don’t have people to talk to”; “But
I’m shy”; “But it’s too difficult.”

41
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,440
Let’s talk about that quickly.

42
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,320
Part three: get used to pressure.

43
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,010
Speaking a foreign language is hard. Situations
which would be easy in your language can feel

44
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,929
difficult in another language. Situations
which would feel difficult in your language

45
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,610
can feel almost impossible when you have to
do them in a foreign language.

46
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:51,040
That’s how it is. It’s easy to imagine
when you start learning another language that

47
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,590
you will reach a point where everything is
easy and comfortable.

48
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,100
But unless you live in a foreign country and
live completely inside that culture, that

49
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:06,620
won’t happen. Trust me—I’ve studied
several languages at this point in my life,

50
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:11,680
and speak them quite well, but it never feels
easy or comfortable.

51
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,560
Why are we talking about this? I’m trying
to motivate you to go out and speak more,

52
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,810
practice more. To do that, you have to accept
that it will feel difficult, uncomfortable

53
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,740
and intimidating a lot of the time.

54
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,590
That’s how it is—don’t let it stop you!
You can still practice, you can still communicate,

55
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,109
and you can still improve.

56
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:42,660
I’ll give you an example of this from my
own experience. I hate making phone calls

57
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:50,150
in another language. I don’t know why, but
I find it particularly intimidating. I guess

58
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:56,049
because I can’t use context or facial expressions
or anything like that to help me understand

59
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,320
or communicate.

60
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,170
I lived in Russia and I studied Russian. I
hated making phone calls in Russian. Then

61
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:10,440
I lived in China and I studied Chinese. I
hated making phone calls in Chinese. Now I’m

62
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,719
studying Greek. Guess what? I hate making
phone calls in Greek, too.

63
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,570
It still feels just as difficult and just
as intimidating. I haven’t learned any tricks

64
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:29,219
to make it easier. All I’ve done is that
I accept that this is how it feels. That’s

65
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,820
it. I still do it, because I have to sometimes.

66
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:39,060
I just accept that I’m going to feel nervous
or uncomfortable, and I have to speak and

67
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,420
communicate anyway.

68
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:47,520
And I do! It doesn't stop you. Feeling nervous
does not stop you communicating.

69
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,400
This will be the same for you sometimes. It
might be phone calls; it might be something

70
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,830
else.

71
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:00,240
The key point? You have to accept and learn
to deal with that pressure. Don’t think:

72
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,760
it feels scary, so I won’t do it. It won’t
feel less scary in the future. The only way

73
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,770
to make it easier is to go out and do it.

74
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:18,090
If you do that, you'll feel more confident.
It will get a little bit easier with time.

75
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:24,310
Okay, so you know the most important point
about fluency, but is there anything else

76
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,510
you can do to practice? Yes, there is!

77
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,900
Part four: speed reading.

78
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,700
Find a text in English. It can be something
from a textbook, from a newspaper, from a

79
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,139
blog, or anywhere.

80
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:45,110
The text should be fairly easy for you. Don’t
choose something with a lot of new words or

81
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,400
something which is way above your current
English level.

82
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,190
Sit down with a timer. Read the text aloud.
Time yourself.

83
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:00,639
Now, read it again. Try to beat your previous
time!

84
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,080
Keep going like this. See how fast you can
read the text.

85
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,789
What’s this for?

86
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:13,650
Remember that part of fluency is physical.
Your mouth needs to produce English sounds

87
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,830
and English words fast and smoothly.

88
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,320
Speed reading like this is a good way to practice
that side of fluency.

89
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:28,020
This way of practicing is really useful because
you can do it almost anywhere and you can

90
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:34,560
also do as much or as little as you have time
for. You can do five minutes practice or fifteen

91
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,360
minutes, or half an hour. It’s all helpful!

92
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,490
Let’s see another good technique like this:

93
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,510
Part five: using songs.

94
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:50,120
Find a song in English. Choose something which
you like.

95
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,120
Find the lyrics online. If you don’t know
where to look, just put the song title and

96
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,130
the word ‘lyrics’ into Google. You’ll
find them.

97
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:04,740
Play the song. Read the lyrics. Sing!

98
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,250
Like with speed reading, this is a good technique
to practice the physical side of fluency.

99
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,150
When you sing a song, you have to go at the
speed of the song.

100
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:21,729
Start with slower songs, then choose faster
ones. Try to choose something that’s possible

101
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:27,699
but challenging, so you can sing the song,
but it’s difficult to go fast enough.

102
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:33,639
Again, this will really help with your physical
fluency. It’s also easy to do; you can do

103
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:39,089
one song a day, and I promise you that you
will feel a difference quite quickly. I used

104
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:45,160
this technique a lot when I was learning Chinese,
and it really helped.

105
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,969
Speed reading and singing songs are good for
physical fluency, but what about the mental

106
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,350
side of fluency?

107
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,889
Let’s see what you can do to improve that.

108
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:58,540
Part six: learn language in chunks.

109
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,930
Here’s a question: how do you learn vocabulary?

110
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:10,859
When I see students learning vocabulary, often
it looks like this.

111
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,310
People write down the English word, the translation
in their own language, and then they try to

112
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,239
memorise it.

113
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,740
Okay, but what does that have to do with fluency?

114
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,670
Think about it: if you learn language like
this, you’re making your brain do things

115
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:31,420
in a very unnatural and complicated way.

116
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,189
First of all, you’re learning each word
individually. But, when you speak a language,

117
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:41,589
you don’t need individual words, you need
phrases and sentences.

118
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:48,329
Secondly, if you do this, you’re learning
English through your own language. You’re

119
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:54,449
not learning to speak English, you’re trying
to learn to translate your language into English

120
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:55,920
in your head.

121
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,110
So, does this sound familiar? You have a sentence
in your head in your own language. You move

122
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:07,019
through the sentence, translating each word
into English.

123
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:13,009
If you don’t know the translation of a word,
you get stuck, you feel bad about your English,

124
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:15,440
and you stop speaking.

125
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,199
You need to break this habit if you want to
speak fluently. First of all, this way of

126
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:26,498
thinking and speaking is always slow. It will
always be slow, because you’re trying to

127
00:10:26,499 --> 00:10:29,040
do too many things at once.

128
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,550
You’re trying to think and remember things
in two languages—it’s too difficult for

129
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,699
anybody.

130
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,510
So what can you do?

131
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:45,779
We said before that you need phrases and sentences
when you speak. So, learn language in phrases

132
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,050
and sentences.

133
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,819
For example, imagine that someone asks you:

134
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,519
"What are you doing this weekend?"

135
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,329
Look at three answers:

136
00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:02,839
"I’m going to see some old friends."
"I’m thinking of going for a bike ride."

137
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,480
"I might do some odd jobs around the house."

138
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,839
Now, make your own sentences:

139
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,869
"I’m going to ________."
"I’m thinking of ________."

140
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:22,949
"I might ________."

141
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:28,368
Try to make two or three sentences for each
one, so that you use different endings.

142
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:32,240
Now think: if someone asks you this question:

143
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,930
"What are you doing this weekend?"

144
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:41,649
If you remember language in big pieces, you
only have to remember two things:

145
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:50,189
"(I’m going to) + (see some old friends)."
"(I’m going to) + (have dinner with my family)."

146
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:55,618
"(I’m going to) + (watch some old movies)."

147
00:11:55,619 --> 00:12:00,529
That makes it easy to respond to questions
like this fluently.

148
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:05,350
On the other hand, if you make a sentence
in your head in err... your language in your

149
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:12,220
head, and then translate each word into English,
it’s much more complicated. You don’t

150
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,139
just have to remember two things; you have
to remember many things.

151
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:22,899
So, try to learn vocabulary in this way. Take
a sentence like:

152
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:26,149
"I went for a walk yesterday."

153
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:30,489
Keep the basic sentence form, but change part
of it:

154
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:33,130
"I ________ yesterday."

155
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:38,550
Now, make 2-3 different sentences:

156
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,529
"I took an exam yesterday."
"I was lazy all day yesterday."

157
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,389
"I cooked a spicy curry yesterday."

158
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:54,369
Now, practice and remember the sentences and
phrases. This is a much more natural way to

159
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:56,559
learn vocabulary.

160
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:01,618
If you learn vocabulary like this, it will
be much easier to respond fluently, because

161
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:06,509
you won’t need to think in your own language
and translate. You’ll remember the whole

162
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:09,290
phrases and sentences that you need.

163
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:14,219
Okay, that’s the end of our lesson. I hope
you learned something about spoken fluency

164
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,690
and how you can improve your fluency in English!
