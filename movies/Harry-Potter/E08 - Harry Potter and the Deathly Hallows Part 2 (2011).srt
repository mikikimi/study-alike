1
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:34,925
It's beautiful here.

2
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:39,909
It was our aunt's.
We used to come here as kids.

3
00:02:41,423 --> 00:02:43,128
The Order uses it
now as a safe house.

4
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:46,675
What's left of us at least.

5
00:02:49,615 --> 00:02:51,351
Muggles think these
things keep evil away.

6
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:52,938
But they're wrong.

7
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:57,469
I need to talk to the Goblin.

8
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,883
How are you?

9
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:34,563
- You buried the elf?
- Yes.

10
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,462
And brought me here.

11
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,517
You are...

12
00:03:42,814 --> 00:03:44,481
Pretty unusual, is it?

13
00:03:52,668 --> 00:03:54,197
How did you come by the sword?

14
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:00,532
It's complicated.

15
00:04:02,854 --> 00:04:05,689
Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think
it should be in her vault at Gringotts?

16
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:09,255
It's complicated.

17
00:04:13,138 --> 00:04:15,983
The sword presented itself to us,
in moment of need.

18
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:18,049
We didn't steal it.

19
00:04:21,603 --> 00:04:24,847
There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's
vault identical to this one.

20
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:26,274
But it is a fake.

21
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:28,592
It was placed there this past summer.

22
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:30,378
And she never suspected
it was a fake.

23
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,765
The replica is very convincing.

24
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:35,522
Only a goblin would recognize that
this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.

25
00:04:36,448 --> 00:04:37,328
Who is the acquaintance?

26
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:39,525
A Hogwarts Professor.

27
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,324
As I understand that
he's now Headmaster.

28
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,221
Snape.

29
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:47,675
He put a fake sword
in Bellatrix's vault.

30
00:04:49,045 --> 00:04:49,679
Why?

31
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:53,826
There are more than a few curious things
in the vaults at Gringotts.

32
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:57,920
And in Madam Lestrange's
vault as well?

33
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:02,149
Perhaps.

34
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:06,604
I need to get into Gringotts.

35
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:08,100
Into one of the vaults.

36
00:05:09,064 --> 00:05:11,659
- It is impossible.
- Alone, yes.

37
00:05:12,051 --> 00:05:13,598
But with you, no.

38
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,926
- Why should I help you?
- I have gold.

39
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:23,725
Lots of it.

40
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:25,105
I've no interest in gold.

41
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:26,365
Then what?

42
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:32,799
That.

43
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,595
That is my price.

44
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,624
Are you thinking there's a
Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?

45
00:05:52,338 --> 00:05:54,178
Well, she was terrified when she
thought we had been in there.

46
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,284
She kept asking you,
what else was taken?

47
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:59,832
I bet you anything, there's Horcrux
in there. Another piece of his soul.

48
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:03,122
Let's find it, kill it, and we are
one step closer to killing him.

49
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:04,280
And what happens when we find it,

50
00:06:05,152 --> 00:06:07,289
How're we supposed to destroy it,
now you're giving the sword to Griphook?

51
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,251
I'm still working on that part.

52
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:13,696
He's weak.

53
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:24,680
Who?

54
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:27,887
Mr. Ollivander

55
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:30,888
I need to ask you a few questions.

56
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:33,163
Anything, m'boy.
Anything!

57
00:06:35,464 --> 00:06:39,459
Would you mind identifying this wand?
We need to know if it's safe to use.

58
00:06:43,555 --> 00:06:47,337
Uhh... Walnut

59
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:50,809
Dragon Heartstring

60
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:54,135
12 and three quarter inches.

61
00:06:56,142 --> 00:06:56,919
Unyie...

62
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:01,172
Unyielding.

63
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:06,442
This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.

64
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:11,659
And this?

65
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:16,127
Hawthorn.

66
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:20,083
An unicorn hair.

67
00:07:21,515 --> 00:07:22,192
10 inches.

68
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:25,152
Reasonably pliant.

69
00:07:29,776 --> 00:07:33,091
This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.

70
00:07:34,992 --> 00:07:35,478
Was?

71
00:07:36,396 --> 00:07:37,158
Is it not still?

72
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:40,529
Well, perhaps not.
If you won it from him.

73
00:07:44,134 --> 00:07:46,704
I sense its allegiance has changed.

74
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:56,151
You talk about wands,
as if they have feelings...

75
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,057
... can think!

76
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,417
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr.
Potter.

77
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:13,535
That much has always been clear to
those of us who've studied wandlore.

78
00:08:15,534 --> 00:08:18,123
And, what do you know
about the Deathly Hallows?

79
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,486
It is rumored there are three.

80
00:08:28,492 --> 00:08:35,786
The Elder Wand, the Cloak of Invisibility,
to hide you from your enemies...

81
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:41,521
and the Resurrection Stone, to bring
back loved ones from the dead.

82
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:46,816
Together,
they make one the Master of Death.

83
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:54,001
But few,
truly believe that such objects exist.

84
00:08:54,126 --> 00:08:54,726
Do you?

85
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,782
Do you believe they exist, sir?

86
00:09:00,295 --> 00:09:01,266
Well...

87
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:07,459
I see no reason to put
stock into an old wives' tale.

88
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:09,739
You're lying!

89
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:12,908
You know one exists.

90
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:18,292
You told him about it.
You told him about the Elder Wand...

91
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:20,962
and where he could go looking for it.

92
00:09:24,803 --> 00:09:26,204
He tortured me.

93
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:30,716
Besides...

94
00:09:32,577 --> 00:09:34,245
... I only conveyed rumors.

95
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:37,634
There's...

96
00:09:39,987 --> 00:09:42,387
There's no telling
whether he will find it.

97
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:47,391
He has found it, sir.

98
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:54,568
We'll let you rest.

99
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,099
He's after you, Mr. Potter.

100
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:03,317
If it's true what you say,

101
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,951
that he has the Elder Wand,

102
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:09,702
I'm afraid,

103
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:13,129
... you really don't stand a chance.

104
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:17,361
Well, I suppose I'll have to kill him,
before he finds me, then.

105
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:25,083
You're sure that's hers?

106
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,441
Positive.

107
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,167
Well?

108
00:10:38,144 --> 00:10:39,129
How do I look?

109
00:10:40,396 --> 00:10:41,025
Hideous.

110
00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:45,332
You can give that to Hermione to hold.
Alright, Griphook?

111
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,001
We're relying on you, Griphook.

112
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:09,041
If you get us past the
guards into the vault...

113
00:11:09,404 --> 00:11:10,104
The sword's yours.

114
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,702
Madam Lestrange.

115
00:11:25,205 --> 00:11:25,831
Good morning.

116
00:11:28,294 --> 00:11:31,017
Good morning?
Good morning?

117
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,412
You're Bellatrix Lestrange,
not some school girl!

118
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:35,921
Hey!
Easy!

119
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:41,324
If she gives us away, we must swear to
use that sword to slit our own throats.

120
00:11:42,097 --> 00:11:42,841
Understand?

121
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:44,850
No, he's right.

122
00:11:45,362 --> 00:11:46,379
I speak stupid.

123
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:50,138
Okay.
Let's do it.

124
00:12:55,711 --> 00:12:58,167
I wish to enter my vault.

125
00:13:01,891 --> 00:13:03,741
Identification?

126
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,172
I hardly think that
would be necessary.

127
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,572
Madam Lestrange.

128
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:21,247
I don't like to be kept waiting.

129
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:22,930
<i>I know...</i>

130
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:25,351
<i>They know she's an impostor.</i>

131
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:30,174
<i>They'd be warned.</i>

132
00:13:38,756 --> 00:13:39,332
Harry...

133
00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:42,034
What do we do, Harry?

134
00:13:48,654 --> 00:13:52,039
Madam Lestrange,
would you mind presenting your wand?

135
00:13:53,255 --> 00:13:54,632
And why should I do that?

136
00:13:54,757 --> 00:13:59,567
It's the bank's policy! I'm sure you
understand, given current climate.

137
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,619
No! I most certainly
do not understand!

138
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:07,053
I'm afraid, I must insist.

139
00:14:13,116 --> 00:14:13,949
<i>Imperio!</i>

140
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:22,419
Very well, Madam Lestrange.

141
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:24,138
If you will follow me?

142
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:01,832
What is that, Griphook?

143
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:07,938
Griphook!

144
00:15:27,342 --> 00:15:29,091
<i>Aresto Momentum</i>

145
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:34,824
Well done, Hermione.

146
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:45,016
Oh no, you two're like you again.

147
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:49,403
The Thief's Downfall,
washes away all enchantments.

148
00:15:50,174 --> 00:15:51,027
Can be deadly.

149
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,148
You don't say.

150
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:55,300
Just out of interest,
is there any other way out of here?

151
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:56,752
No.

152
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:02,116
What the devil are all
you doing down here?

153
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,646
Thieves!

154
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:04,954
You gave up the.....

155
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:06,009
<i>-Imperio
-You!</i>

156
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,811
That doesn't sound good.

157
00:16:30,527 --> 00:16:31,198
Bloody hell!

158
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:32,953
That's an Ukrainian Ironbelly.

159
00:16:33,331 --> 00:16:33,725
Here.

160
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,101
It's been trained to expect pain
when it hears the noise.

161
00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:49,707
That's barbaric!

162
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:20,973
<i>Lumos</i>

163
00:17:26,386 --> 00:17:27,044
Blimey!

164
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:36,077
<i>Accio Horcrux</i>

165
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,323
You seem you're gonna try
that one to get over here?

166
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:42,548
No kind of magic would work in here.

167
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:48,887
It's in here, Harry?

168
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:51,653
Can you feel anything?

169
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:16,072
That's it!
Up there!

170
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,069
They have added the Gemino curse.
Everything you touch will multiply.

171
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,295
Give me the sword.

172
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:43,849
Stop moving!

173
00:19:07,158 --> 00:19:07,665
Do it!

174
00:19:11,274 --> 00:19:12,336
We had deal, Griphook!

175
00:19:12,337 --> 00:19:13,735
The cup for the sword!

176
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,121
I said I'll get you in, I didn't
say anything about getting you out.

177
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:48,870
Griphook! Thieves!
Griphook!

178
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:50,283
Hey, thieves!

179
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,060
Is that okay?

180
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:56,928
We've still got Bogrod.

181
00:20:04,608 --> 00:20:05,495
That's unfortunate.

182
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:11,322
We can't just stand here,

183
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:12,215
You got any idea?

184
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:16,116
I've got something, but it's mad!

185
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:17,701
<i>Reducto</i>

186
00:20:30,622 --> 00:20:31,700
Well, come on, then!

187
00:20:34,315 --> 00:20:35,221
<i>Relashio</i>

188
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:23,691
Keep moving!

189
00:21:51,525 --> 00:21:52,270
Now what?

190
00:21:52,782 --> 00:21:53,552
<i>Reducto</i>

191
00:21:55,484 --> 00:21:56,111
Hold on.

192
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:09,006
That was brilliant!
Absolutely brilliant!

193
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,456
We're dropping!

194
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,037
- I say we jump!
- When?

195
00:22:44,623 --> 00:22:45,250
Now!

196
00:23:40,492 --> 00:23:40,995
He knows.

197
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:42,655
You-Know-Who.

198
00:23:43,611 --> 00:23:44,863
He knows we broke into Gringotts.

199
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,041
He knows what we took,
and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes.

200
00:23:48,715 --> 00:23:50,066
- How is it you know?
- I saw him.

201
00:23:50,715 --> 00:23:53,184
You let him in?
Harry, you can't do that!

202
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:54,880
Hermione, I can't always help it!

203
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:56,845
Well, maybe I can.
I don't know!

204
00:23:57,174 --> 00:23:58,192
Never mind!
What happened?

205
00:23:58,756 --> 00:24:00,402
Well, he's angry...

206
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:01,926
and scared too.

207
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:05,384
He knows, if we find and destroy all the
Horcruxes, we'll be able to kill him.

208
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,661
I reckon he'll stop at nothing
to make sure we don't find the rest.

209
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:11,675
And there's more.

210
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,053
One of them is at Hogwarts.

211
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,078
What?

212
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:15,954
You saw it?

213
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:16,850
I saw the castle.

214
00:24:16,975 --> 00:24:18,061
And Rowena Ravenclaw.

215
00:24:18,186 --> 00:24:19,384
It must have something
to do with her.

216
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:20,620
We have to go there, now!

217
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,048
Well, we can't do that!

218
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,387
We've got to plan,
we've got to figure it out!

219
00:24:24,512 --> 00:24:27,443
Hermione, when have any of
our plans ever actually worked?

220
00:24:27,694 --> 00:24:29,647
We plan, we get there,
all hell breaks loose.

221
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,311
He's right!
One problem...

222
00:24:34,127 --> 00:24:36,849
Snape's Headmaster now,
we can't just move from the front door!

223
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,492
Well, we'll go to Hogsmeade,

224
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:41,784
to Honeydukes.

225
00:24:42,043 --> 00:24:43,387
Take the secret
passage in the cellar.

226
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:44,944
It's...

227
00:24:45,725 --> 00:24:47,054
There's something wrong with him.

228
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:49,265
It's like, you know, in the past...

229
00:24:50,318 --> 00:24:52,009
I've always been able
to follow his thoughts.

230
00:24:52,627 --> 00:24:54,385
And now everything just
feels disconnected.

231
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:57,699
Maybe it's the Horcruxes.
Maybe he's growing weaker.

232
00:24:57,824 --> 00:24:58,671
Maybe he's dying!

233
00:24:59,145 --> 00:24:59,526
No!

234
00:25:00,185 --> 00:25:01,721
No, it's...
it's more like he's wounded.

235
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,272
If anything, he feels more dangerous.

236
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,646
- Right here. Come on!
- Search everywhere.

237
00:25:56,771 --> 00:25:57,214
Go, move!

238
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,102
Faster!

239
00:26:31,087 --> 00:26:32,006
In here, Potter.

240
00:26:36,704 --> 00:26:37,831
<i>Come on, move!</i>

241
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:46,982
Did you look at him?

242
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:50,785
- For a second I thought that was...
- I know. Dumbledore!

243
00:27:07,513 --> 00:27:08,104
Harry?

244
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:12,065
I can see you in this.

245
00:27:26,015 --> 00:27:28,587
Bloody fools,
what were you thinking, coming here?

246
00:27:29,017 --> 00:27:31,273
Have you any idea
how dangerous it is?

247
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:34,090
You're Aberforth,
Dumbledore's brother.

248
00:27:35,736 --> 00:27:37,188
It's you who I've
been seeing in here.

249
00:27:38,385 --> 00:27:39,460
You're the one who sent Dobby.

250
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:42,383
- Why've you left him?
- He's dead.

251
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,496
Sorry to hear it.
I liked that elf.

252
00:27:45,774 --> 00:27:46,687
Who gave that to you?

253
00:27:47,016 --> 00:27:47,623
The mirror?

254
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,588
Mundungus Fletcher, 'bout a year ago.

255
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:53,405
Dung had no right selling that to you.
It belongs to...

256
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,096
Sirius...

257
00:27:55,615 --> 00:27:56,840
Albus told me.

258
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,565
He also told me you'd
likely be hacked off,

259
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:03,515
... if you ever found that I had it.
But, ask yourself;

260
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:06,292
Where would you be if I didn't?

261
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:11,446
Do you have any others much?

262
00:28:11,794 --> 00:28:12,453
From the Order?

263
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:14,303
The Order's finished.

264
00:28:15,284 --> 00:28:16,333
You-Know-Who's won,

265
00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:19,861
... anyone who says otherwise
is killing themselves.

266
00:28:20,403 --> 00:28:22,628
We need to get into Hogwarts,
tonight.

267
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:24,813
Dumbledore gave us a job to do.

268
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:26,102
Did he now...

269
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,341
Nice job?
Easy?

270
00:28:30,173 --> 00:28:31,516
We've been hunting Horcruxes.

271
00:28:32,897 --> 00:28:34,742
And we think the last one's inside
the castle.

272
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:36,239
But we'll need your help getting in.

273
00:28:36,364 --> 00:28:39,915
Which job my brother has given you no,
it's a suicide mission.

274
00:28:40,237 --> 00:28:42,163
Do yourself a favor, boy.
Go home!

275
00:28:42,705 --> 00:28:43,666
Live a little longer.

276
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:45,461
Dumbledore trusted
me to see this through.

277
00:28:45,586 --> 00:28:47,458
What makes you think
you can trust him?

278
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:51,361
What makes you think you can believe
anything my brother told you?

279
00:28:51,616 --> 00:28:52,633
And in all the time you knew him...

280
00:28:53,324 --> 00:28:54,765
Did he ever mention my name?

281
00:28:56,296 --> 00:28:57,728
Did he ever mentioned hers?

282
00:28:58,574 --> 00:29:00,148
- Why should he...
- Keep secrets.

283
00:29:00,273 --> 00:29:01,714
You tell me?

284
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:05,740
- I trusted him.
- That's a boy's answer.

285
00:29:07,102 --> 00:29:11,622
A boy goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of a
man who wouldn't even tell him where to start.

286
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:12,679
You're lying!

287
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:17,295
Not just on me, that doesn't matter.
To yourself as well.

288
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:18,957
That's what a fool does.

289
00:29:19,873 --> 00:29:23,414
You don't strike me as a fool,
Harry Potter!

290
00:29:23,966 --> 00:29:27,460
So, I'll ask you again,
there must be a reason.

291
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,705
I'm not interested in what happened
between you and your brother.

292
00:29:34,528 --> 00:29:35,965
I don't care that you've given up.

293
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:40,766
I trusted the man I knew.

294
00:29:44,946 --> 00:29:46,583
We need to get into
the castle tonight.

295
00:29:53,362 --> 00:29:54,706
You know what to do.

296
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:03,290
Where've you sent her?

297
00:30:04,743 --> 00:30:05,461
You'll see.

298
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,448
Soon enough.

299
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,332
That's your sister, Ariana.
Isn't it?

300
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:19,927
She died very young, didn't she?

301
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,259
My brother sacrificed many things,
Mr. Potter.

302
00:30:25,926 --> 00:30:27,635
On his journey to find power.

303
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,768
Including Ariana.

304
00:30:31,022 --> 00:30:32,959
And she was devoted to him.

305
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,903
He gave her everything,

306
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:38,862
... but time.

307
00:30:41,265 --> 00:30:42,493
Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.

308
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:51,876
He did save our lives twice!

309
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:54,612
Kept an eye on us on that mirror.

310
00:30:57,228 --> 00:30:58,868
That doesn't seem like
someone who's given up!

311
00:31:05,445 --> 00:31:06,180
She's coming back.

312
00:31:08,231 --> 00:31:08,939
What's that with her?

313
00:31:17,924 --> 00:31:18,381
Neville!

314
00:31:18,825 --> 00:31:19,401
How you look...

315
00:31:19,402 --> 00:31:20,438
Like hell, I reckon.

316
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,331
This is nothing.

317
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:23,861
Seamus is worse.

318
00:31:24,756 --> 00:31:25,596
Hey, Ab!

319
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:27,261
We've got a couple
more coming through.

320
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:31,022
Don't remember this
on the Marauder's Map.

321
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,066
That's because it
never existed till now.

322
00:31:33,745 --> 00:31:36,450
The seven secret passages were sealed
off, before the start of the year.

323
00:31:37,089 --> 00:31:38,279
This is the only way in or out, now.

324
00:31:39,442 --> 00:31:41,312
The grounds are crawled with
Death Eaters and Dementors.

325
00:31:41,936 --> 00:31:43,483
How about Mr. Snape as Headmaster?

326
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:44,529
Hardly ever seen.

327
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,291
It's the Carrows who's watch out for.

328
00:31:47,102 --> 00:31:47,644
Carrows?

329
00:31:47,924 --> 00:31:50,269
Yeah. Brother and sister.
Incharge of discipline.

330
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,023
They like punishment, the Carrows.

331
00:31:52,739 --> 00:31:53,410
They did that to you?

332
00:31:54,092 --> 00:31:54,561
Why?

333
00:31:54,943 --> 00:31:57,886
Today's Dark Arts lesson was
practicing the Cruciatus curse.

334
00:31:58,728 --> 00:31:59,560
On first years.

335
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:01,449
I refused.

336
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,490
Hogwarts has changed.

337
00:32:18,362 --> 00:32:19,930
Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?

338
00:32:26,003 --> 00:32:27,579
Hey, listen up you lot!

339
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:29,053
I've for you a surprise.

340
00:32:29,178 --> 00:32:30,914
No more Aberforth's cook gonna help.

341
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:32,953
We'll be surprised if
we can digest that.

342
00:32:35,877 --> 00:32:38,148
- Oh my!
- Harry!

343
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,549
Get the word out to Remus and
the others, that Harry is back.

344
00:32:55,314 --> 00:32:56,027
Okay, okay!

345
00:32:56,553 --> 00:32:57,791
Let's not kill him
before You-Know-Who does.

346
00:32:57,916 --> 00:33:02,103
... Do you read? We've a new weather report.
Lightning has struck. I repeat: Lightning has struck.

347
00:33:02,228 --> 00:33:02,730
What's the fun, Harry?

348
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:09,964
Okay.

349
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,437
There's something we need to find.

350
00:33:13,477 --> 00:33:15,359
Something hidden here, in the castle.

351
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:17,557
And it may help us to defeat
You-Know-Who.

352
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,121
- Alright, what is it?
- We don't know.

353
00:33:23,686 --> 00:33:25,624
- Where is it?
- We don't know that either.

354
00:33:27,985 --> 00:33:29,112
I realize there's not much to go on.

355
00:33:29,237 --> 00:33:30,078
That's nothing to go on.

356
00:33:31,181 --> 00:33:33,065
I think it has something
to do with Ravenclaw.

357
00:33:34,261 --> 00:33:38,178
It'll be small, easily concealed.

358
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,689
Anyone, any ideas?

359
00:33:43,015 --> 00:33:45,323
Well, there's Rowena
Ravenclaw's lost diadem.

360
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:46,621
Oh, bloody hell!
Here we go!

361
00:33:48,272 --> 00:33:49,770
Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?

362
00:33:50,918 --> 00:33:52,254
Hasn't anyone heard of this?

363
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:54,169
It's quite famous.

364
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:56,703
Yes. But, Luna, it's lost.

365
00:33:57,064 --> 00:34:00,505
For centuries. There's no person
alive today who's seen it.

366
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:03,244
Excuse me, can someone tell
me what bloody diadem is?

367
00:34:03,762 --> 00:34:04,917
It's a sort of crown.

368
00:34:05,364 --> 00:34:06,384
You know, like a tiara.

369
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:10,406
Harry!

370
00:34:12,023 --> 00:34:12,851
Hi, there.

371
00:34:16,772 --> 00:34:19,342
Six months she doesn't see me and
it's like I'm a frankie first-year.

372
00:34:19,993 --> 00:34:20,614
I'm her brother!

373
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:23,483
- She's got lots of them, but she's got only one Harry.
- Shut up, Seamus!

374
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:25,062
What is it, Ginny?

375
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:29,342
Snape knows... he knows
that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.

376
00:35:09,382 --> 00:35:13,694
Many of you are surely wondering,
why I have summoned you at this hour.

377
00:35:17,189 --> 00:35:19,854
It's come to my attention,
that earlier this evening...

378
00:35:22,356 --> 00:35:24,352
Harry Potter was
sighted in Hogsmeade.

379
00:35:27,222 --> 00:35:27,920
Now...

380
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,296
should anyone...

381
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:37,372
student or staff attempt to aid Mr.
Potter?

382
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:46,730
They will be punished in a manner consistent with
the severity of their transcription, further more...

383
00:35:48,149 --> 00:35:51,749
Any person found to have
knowledge of these events...

384
00:35:54,107 --> 00:35:57,396
who fails to come forward...

385
00:35:59,063 --> 00:36:06,615
... will be treated as equally guilty.

386
00:36:09,677 --> 00:36:10,483
Another...

387
00:36:15,275 --> 00:36:22,637
If anyone in here has any knowledge of
Mr. Potter's movements this evening.

388
00:36:25,939 --> 00:36:28,745
I invite them to step forward.

389
00:36:33,231 --> 00:36:34,476
Now!

390
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:53,154
It seems, despite your
exhaustive defensive strategies,

391
00:36:53,735 --> 00:36:55,890
... you still have a bit of
security problem, Headmaster.

392
00:37:00,004 --> 00:37:01,508
I'm afraid it's quite extensive.

393
00:37:03,498 --> 00:37:05,361
How dare you stand where he stood?

394
00:37:07,384 --> 00:37:11,164
Tell them how it happened that night?
Tell them how you looked him in the eye...

395
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:13,841
A man who trusted you,
and killed him.

396
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,098
Tell them!

397
00:37:51,461 --> 00:37:53,295
<i>Harry.</i>

398
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,442
Potter?

399
00:38:30,663 --> 00:38:35,538
<i>I know that many of
you will want to fight.</i>

400
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:41,544
<i>Some of you may even think
that to fight is wise.</i>

401
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,565
<i>But this is folly.</i>

402
00:38:45,283 --> 00:38:47,860
<i>Give me Harry Potter.</i>

403
00:38:49,157 --> 00:38:52,849
<i>Do this and none shall be harmed.</i>

404
00:38:53,283 --> 00:38:59,512
<i>Give me Harry Potter,
and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.</i>

405
00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:06,786
<i>Give me Harry Potter,
and you will be rewarded.</i>

406
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,596
<i>You have one hour.</i>

407
00:39:20,188 --> 00:39:23,105
What're you waiting for?
Someone grab him!

408
00:39:32,714 --> 00:39:37,136
Students out of bed!
Students out of bed!

409
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:39,278
Students in the corridor!

410
00:39:39,403 --> 00:39:42,543
They're supposed to be out of bed,
you blithering idiot!

411
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:47,185
Sorry ma'am.

412
00:39:47,494 --> 00:39:48,828
As it happens, Mr. Filch...

413
00:39:49,106 --> 00:39:50,786
Your arrival is most opportune.

414
00:39:51,609 --> 00:39:58,203
If you would, I would like you please, to lead Miss
Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin house, from the hall.

415
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,087
Exactly where is it I'll
be leading 'em to, ma'am?

416
00:40:01,212 --> 00:40:02,627
The dungeons would do.

417
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:10,830
I presume you have a reason
for returning, Potter.

418
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:12,092
What is it you need?

419
00:40:12,217 --> 00:40:14,863
Time, Professor.
As much as you can get me.

420
00:40:15,641 --> 00:40:16,594
Do what you have to do.

421
00:40:17,103 --> 00:40:18,378
I'll secure the castle.

422
00:40:20,158 --> 00:40:20,708
Potter...

423
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:24,636
It's good to see you.

424
00:40:26,325 --> 00:40:27,613
It's good to see you too, Professor.

425
00:40:29,229 --> 00:40:30,229
Hold the fort, Neville.

426
00:40:42,937 --> 00:40:43,344
Harry!

427
00:40:44,379 --> 00:40:47,290
Hermione and I've been thinking,
it doesn't matter if we find a Horcrux.

428
00:40:47,743 --> 00:40:48,427
What do you mean?

429
00:40:48,674 --> 00:40:50,022
Unless we can destroy it.

430
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:51,453
So, we were thinking...

431
00:40:51,578 --> 00:40:52,907
Well, Ron was thinking,
it was Ron's idea.

432
00:40:53,073 --> 00:40:53,902
It's completely brilliant.

433
00:40:54,302 --> 00:40:56,527
You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary
with a Basilisk's fang, right?

434
00:40:57,657 --> 00:40:59,835
Well, me and Hermione did remind
where we might find one.

435
00:41:00,096 --> 00:41:00,657
Okay.

436
00:41:02,062 --> 00:41:03,066
Okay, but take this.

437
00:41:03,689 --> 00:41:04,995
That way,
you can find me when you get back.

438
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,551
Where're you going?

439
00:41:06,676 --> 00:41:08,897
Ravenclaw common room,
Gotta start somewhere.

440
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:16,281
Harry!

441
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:18,199
Harry!

442
00:41:19,325 --> 00:41:20,421
Let me get this straight,
Professor...

443
00:41:21,028 --> 00:41:22,606
You're actually giving us
permission to do this?

444
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:24,624
That is correct, Longbottom.

445
00:41:25,223 --> 00:41:26,326
To blow it up!
Boom!

446
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,326
Boom!

447
00:41:28,372 --> 00:41:29,065
Wicked!

448
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:30,934
But how on earth are
we gonna do that?

449
00:41:31,912 --> 00:41:33,868
Why don't you confer with Mr.
Finnigan?

450
00:41:34,405 --> 00:41:37,985
As I recall, he has a particular
proclivity for pyro-technics.

451
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,116
I can bring it down.

452
00:41:39,241 --> 00:41:40,561
That's the spirit!
Away, you go.

453
00:41:42,629 --> 00:41:46,095
You do realize, of course, we can't
keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.

454
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,152
That doesn't mean we can't delay him.

455
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:54,184
And his name is Voldemort.
Filius, you might as well use it.

456
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:57,004
He's come to try to kill you,
either way!

457
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:02,706
<i>Piertotum Locomotor.</i>

458
00:42:18,763 --> 00:42:20,080
Hogwarts is threatened.

459
00:42:20,656 --> 00:42:24,067
Man the boundaries! Protect us.
Do your duty...

460
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:25,805
... to our school.

461
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:32,493
I've always wanted to use that spell!

462
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,548
Harry, wait!

463
00:43:27,193 --> 00:43:28,114
I need to talk to you!

464
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:30,926
- I'm a bit pre-occupied at the moment, Luna.
- You don't know anything where you're going.

465
00:43:31,051 --> 00:43:31,990
You're wasting your time!

466
00:43:32,461 --> 00:43:33,657
Look, we'll talk later, okay, Luna?

467
00:43:33,782 --> 00:43:35,179
- Harry?
- Later.

468
00:43:35,304 --> 00:43:37,571
Harry Potter,
you listen to me right now!

469
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,738
Do you remember what Cho said
about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem?

470
00:43:43,235 --> 00:43:44,997
There is not a person
alive who's seen it.

471
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:47,742
It's obvious, isn't it?

472
00:43:48,502 --> 00:43:50,339
We have to talk to
someone who's dead.

473
00:44:01,529 --> 00:44:03,036
It's very impressive, isn't it?

474
00:44:19,538 --> 00:44:22,260
If you've to find her,
you'll find her down there.

475
00:44:22,385 --> 00:44:23,692
- Aren't you coming?
- No.

476
00:44:23,967 --> 00:44:25,887
I think it's best if
you two talk alone.

477
00:44:26,611 --> 00:44:27,619
She's very shy.

478
00:44:55,324 --> 00:44:56,254
You're the Grey Lady.

479
00:44:57,734 --> 00:44:59,277
The ghost of Ravenclaw tower.

480
00:44:59,645 --> 00:45:01,437
I do not answer to that name!

481
00:45:01,668 --> 00:45:03,069
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

482
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,684
It's Helena, isn't it?

483
00:45:05,272 --> 00:45:07,738
Helena Ravenclaw, Rowena's daughter.

484
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:10,399
Are you a friend of Luna's?

485
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:11,655
Yes.

486
00:45:12,896 --> 00:45:14,537
And she thought you
might be able to help me.

487
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:19,325
You seek my mother's diadem?

488
00:45:21,465 --> 00:45:22,219
Yes.

489
00:45:24,106 --> 00:45:24,810
That's right.

490
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,358
Luna is kind.

491
00:45:28,953 --> 00:45:30,856
Unlike so many of the others.

492
00:45:31,716 --> 00:45:34,821
But she was wrong, I cannot help you!

493
00:45:39,447 --> 00:45:40,891
Wait, please!

494
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,059
I want to destroy it!

495
00:46:23,645 --> 00:46:25,128
They never learn.

496
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,316
Such a pity.

497
00:46:29,573 --> 00:46:31,507
But, my Lord...

498
00:46:33,066 --> 00:46:34,269
Shouldn't we wait?

499
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:43,195
Begin!

500
00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:05,821
I thought you want to do it.
Isn't it, Helena?

501
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:13,474
You want to destroy it?

502
00:47:13,811 --> 00:47:16,341
Another swore to destroy it,
many years ago.

503
00:47:17,271 --> 00:47:19,598
A strange boy with a strange name.

504
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:20,876
Tom Riddle.

505
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:22,071
But he lied.

506
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:24,175
He's lied to many people.

507
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,364
I know what he's done!
I know who he is!

508
00:47:27,735 --> 00:47:30,824
He defiled it, with dark magic!

509
00:47:45,693 --> 00:47:46,996
I can destroy it.

510
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,606
Once and for all.

511
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:53,142
But only if you tell me
where he hid it?

512
00:47:56,187 --> 00:47:59,564
You do know, where he hid it?

513
00:48:00,097 --> 00:48:00,908
Don't you, Helena?

514
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:04,745
You just have to tell me.

515
00:48:07,407 --> 00:48:08,273
Please!

516
00:48:20,978 --> 00:48:22,329
Strange!

517
00:48:26,207 --> 00:48:28,363
You remind me of him a bit.

518
00:48:30,411 --> 00:48:33,513
It's here, in the castle.

519
00:48:34,554 --> 00:48:36,485
In the place where
everything is hidden.

520
00:48:38,964 --> 00:48:40,120
If you have to ask...

521
00:48:40,665 --> 00:48:41,740
... you will never know.

522
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,603
If you know...

523
00:48:45,271 --> 00:48:46,683
... you need only ask.

524
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:49,655
Thank you!

525
00:49:03,495 --> 00:49:06,497
Tell Professor McGonagall. Remus and
I will handle this side of the castle.

526
00:49:08,552 --> 00:49:09,244
Yes, sir!

527
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:19,138
Hey Dean, on second thoughts, tell Professor McGonagall
we might need one or two more wands this side.

528
00:49:21,819 --> 00:49:24,859
It is the quality of one's convictions
that determine his success...

529
00:49:24,984 --> 00:49:26,618
... not the number of followers.

530
00:49:27,377 --> 00:49:28,214
Who said that?

531
00:49:29,629 --> 00:49:30,161
Me.

532
00:49:35,938 --> 00:49:36,825
You okay, Freddie?

533
00:49:38,264 --> 00:49:38,668
Yeah.

534
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:41,727
Me too.

535
00:49:59,899 --> 00:50:01,000
Harry talks in his sleep.

536
00:50:01,652 --> 00:50:02,358
Do you know this?

537
00:50:04,476 --> 00:50:05,577
No, of course, not!

538
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,986
Yeah?
You and whose army?

539
00:51:17,272 --> 00:51:17,993
You do it.

540
00:51:18,478 --> 00:51:19,129
I can't.

541
00:51:19,254 --> 00:51:19,958
Yes, you can!

542
00:54:19,051 --> 00:54:19,846
Neville!

543
00:54:38,076 --> 00:54:38,909
That went well.

544
00:55:26,058 --> 00:55:30,186
Get inside! This way!
Take cover! Take cover

545
00:55:47,727 --> 00:55:48,522
<i>Stupefy</i>

546
00:55:52,593 --> 00:55:55,424
Ginny, Neville!
You alright?

547
00:55:55,888 --> 00:55:56,594
Never better!

548
00:55:57,029 --> 00:55:58,567
I feel like I can spit fire!

549
00:55:59,062 --> 00:56:00,054
Have you seen Luna up here?

550
00:56:00,294 --> 00:56:00,925
Luna?

551
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:05,708
I'm mad for her. I think it's about time I told
her since we'll probably both be dead by dawn.

552
00:56:10,906 --> 00:56:11,489
I know.

553
00:56:40,561 --> 00:56:42,361
Bloody hell!
We'll never find him on this.

554
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:43,927
Here he is!

555
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:45,781
- Just now...
- Brilliant!

556
00:56:46,094 --> 00:56:47,069
He just vanished.

557
00:56:47,856 --> 00:56:48,849
I just now I saw it.

558
00:56:52,577 --> 00:56:53,944
Maybe he's gone to the
Room of Requirement.

559
00:56:54,515 --> 00:56:55,700
It doesn't show up on the map,
does it?

560
00:56:56,056 --> 00:56:57,023
You said that last year.

561
00:56:58,317 --> 00:56:59,657
That's right, I... I did.

562
00:57:00,823 --> 00:57:01,429
Let's go.

563
00:57:03,226 --> 00:57:03,943
Brilliant!

564
00:57:10,586 --> 00:57:12,138
Come on!

565
00:59:04,325 --> 00:59:05,068
Well, well...

566
00:59:06,648 --> 00:59:07,885
What brings you here, Potter?

567
00:59:09,626 --> 00:59:10,604
I could ask you the same.

568
00:59:11,896 --> 00:59:13,092
You have something of mine.

569
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:15,955
I'd like it back.

570
00:59:16,296 --> 00:59:17,218
What's wrong with the one you have?

571
00:59:17,704 --> 00:59:18,522
It's my mother's.

572
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:20,420
It's powerful, but it's...

573
00:59:21,178 --> 00:59:22,129
... not the same.

574
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:25,832
Doesn't quite understand me.

575
00:59:27,256 --> 00:59:28,001
You know what I mean?

576
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:30,466
Why didn't you tell her?

577
00:59:33,124 --> 00:59:33,888
Bellatrix?

578
00:59:37,779 --> 00:59:38,779
You knew it was me.

579
00:59:40,283 --> 00:59:41,239
You didn't say anything.

580
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:42,926
Come on, Draco!

581
00:59:44,138 --> 00:59:44,954
Don't be a prat.

582
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:46,430
Do it!

583
00:59:48,123 --> 00:59:48,646
Easy!

584
00:59:50,747 --> 00:59:51,509
<i>Expelliarmus</i>

585
00:59:52,459 --> 00:59:53,504
<i>Avada Kedavra</i>

586
00:59:58,757 --> 01:00:01,008
This is my girlfriend,
you bloody gits!

587
01:00:22,991 --> 01:00:23,396
Got it!

588
01:00:39,611 --> 01:00:41,010
They've set the bloody place on fire!

589
01:01:49,626 --> 01:01:50,454
Come on!
This way!

590
01:01:59,366 --> 01:02:00,307
We can't leave them!

591
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:02,360
He's joking, right?

592
01:02:12,173 --> 01:02:14,889
If we die for them,
Harry, I'm gonna kill you!

593
01:02:37,096 --> 01:02:37,691
Harry!

594
01:03:24,778 --> 01:03:25,464
My Lord?

595
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,263
Avada Kedavra!

596
01:03:35,434 --> 01:03:39,047
Come Nagini, I need to keep you safe.

597
01:03:52,755 --> 01:03:53,747
It's the snake....

598
01:03:54,868 --> 01:03:56,170
... and she's the last one.

599
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:57,676
It's the last Horcrux.

600
01:04:04,781 --> 01:04:05,927
Look inside him, Harry.

601
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:10,548
Find out where he is,
if you find him, we can find the snake.

602
01:04:11,219 --> 01:04:12,183
And we can end this!

603
01:04:40,728 --> 01:04:41,710
My Lord...

604
01:04:43,231 --> 01:04:45,943
Might it be less...

605
01:04:47,537 --> 01:04:51,032
I should not be more prudent to call off
this attack.

606
01:04:52,283 --> 01:04:54,251
Simply seek the boy.

607
01:04:54,376 --> 01:04:55,095
Yourself.

608
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:58,368
I do not need to seek the boy...

609
01:04:58,781 --> 01:05:03,258
... before the night is out,
he will come to me! Do you understand?

610
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:05,532
Look at me!

611
01:05:07,243 --> 01:05:10,375
How can you live with yourself,
Lucius?

612
01:05:11,257 --> 01:05:11,947
I don't know.

613
01:05:15,325 --> 01:05:16,599
Go and find Severus.

614
01:05:18,442 --> 01:05:19,510
Bring him to me.

615
01:05:28,481 --> 01:05:29,510
I know where he is.

616
01:05:40,306 --> 01:05:41,071
Come on!

617
01:06:29,551 --> 01:06:30,154
No!

618
01:07:17,914 --> 01:07:21,139
You have performed extra-ordinary magic
with this wand, My Lord,

619
01:07:21,264 --> 01:07:23,257
... in the last few hours alone.

620
01:07:23,382 --> 01:07:24,001
No!

621
01:07:25,645 --> 01:07:32,551
No! I am extra-ordinary.
But the wand resists me.

622
01:07:32,834 --> 01:07:38,242
There is no wand more powerful.
Ollivander himself has said it.

623
01:07:39,023 --> 01:07:44,259
Tonight, when the boy comes.
It will not fail you, I am sure of it...

624
01:07:46,743 --> 01:07:52,602
It answers to you, and you only.

625
01:07:53,622 --> 01:07:54,425
Does it?

626
01:07:58,058 --> 01:07:58,748
My Lord?

627
01:08:01,893 --> 01:08:05,157
The wand, does it truly answer to me?

628
01:08:07,997 --> 01:08:09,648
You're a clever man, Severus.

629
01:08:10,204 --> 01:08:11,447
Surely you must know...

630
01:08:14,339 --> 01:08:19,237
- Where does its true loyalty lie?
- With you...

631
01:08:20,702 --> 01:08:22,567
Of course, My Lord.

632
01:08:22,941 --> 01:08:29,875
The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly,
because I am not its true master.

633
01:08:31,672 --> 01:08:35,958
The Elder Wand belongs to the
wizard who killed its last owner.

634
01:08:43,047 --> 01:08:45,617
You killed Dumbledore, Severus.

635
01:08:47,573 --> 01:08:51,778
While you live, the Elder
Wand cannot truly be mine.

636
01:08:54,362 --> 01:08:57,506
You've been a good and faithful servant,
Severus.

637
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:02,769
But only I can live forever.

638
01:09:07,278 --> 01:09:08,199
My Lord...

639
01:09:14,178 --> 01:09:16,242
Nagini, kill!

640
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:24,420
Take it...
Take it up, please!

641
01:10:25,361 --> 01:10:27,943
Give me something!
Quickly, a flask. Anything!

642
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:48,680
Take them to the Pensieve.

643
01:10:52,027 --> 01:10:53,203
Look at me...

644
01:10:59,526 --> 01:11:01,270
You really have your mother's eyes.

645
01:11:35,444 --> 01:11:41,770
<i>You've fought valiantly,
but in vain...</i>

646
01:11:46,258 --> 01:11:53,863
<i>I do not wish this. Every drop of magical
blood spilled is a terrible waste.</i>

647
01:11:54,459 --> 01:11:57,820
<i>I, therefore command
my forces to retreat...</i>

648
01:11:58,974 --> 01:12:03,601
<i>In their absence,
dispose your dead with dignity,</i>

649
01:12:05,153 --> 01:12:10,750
<i>Harry Potter,
I now speak directly to you.</i>

650
01:12:11,342 --> 01:12:18,826
<i>On this night, you have allowed your friends
to die for you, rather than face me yourself.</i>

651
01:12:19,341 --> 01:12:25,438
<i>There is no greater dishonor.
Join me in the Forbidden Forrest...</i>

652
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:28,099
<i>... and confront your fate.</i>

653
01:12:29,004 --> 01:12:42,301
<i>If you do not do this, I shall kill every last man,
woman and child who tries to conceal you from me.</i>

654
01:13:02,789 --> 01:13:03,670
Where's everybody?

655
01:13:30,725 --> 01:13:31,438
Harry?

656
01:13:37,534 --> 01:13:41,821
Oh, come on!
Don't be sad on it, she's passed.

657
01:13:43,843 --> 01:13:45,123
There, she's gone.

658
01:15:55,464 --> 01:16:00,074
<i>Freak! Come here! I'm gonna tell mommy!
You're freak!</i>

659
01:16:00,552 --> 01:16:02,128
<i>You're freak, Lily!</i>

660
01:16:02,575 --> 01:16:03,387
<i>Come here!</i>

661
01:16:25,655 --> 01:16:28,860
<i>She's jealous.
She's ordinary and you're special.</i>

662
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:30,190
<i>That's not true, Severus.</i>

663
01:16:54,213 --> 01:16:55,506
<i>Gryffindor!</i>

664
01:17:03,796 --> 01:17:05,648
<i>- Hi, I'm James.
- Hi, I'm Lily.</i>

665
01:17:11,365 --> 01:17:12,352
<i>Just like your father.</i>

666
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:17,478
<i>Don't say a word against my father!</i>

667
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:30,206
<i>Masters shall be reunited once more!</i>

668
01:17:30,731 --> 01:17:31,601
<i>Severus.</i>

669
01:17:33,775 --> 01:17:34,947
<i>No, don't kill me!</i>

670
01:17:35,887 --> 01:17:38,117
The prophecy did not
refer to a woman.

671
01:17:39,933 --> 01:17:42,216
It spoke about a boy born
at the end of the July.

672
01:17:42,341 --> 01:17:44,199
Yes, but he thinks it's her son!

673
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:47,663
He intends to hunt them down and
to kill them.

674
01:17:48,524 --> 01:17:52,482
Hide him... hide them all.
I beg you!

675
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,634
What would you give me in exchange,
Severus?

676
01:17:58,117 --> 01:17:59,779
- Anything.
- Harry...

677
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:02,042
<i>Harry, you were so loved.</i>

678
01:18:02,733 --> 01:18:06,999
<i>So loved!
Harry, mama loves you.</i>

679
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:09,415
Dadda loves you.

680
01:18:11,715 --> 01:18:12,995
Harry, be safe.

681
01:18:14,097 --> 01:18:14,977
Be strong.

682
01:18:15,102 --> 01:18:16,521
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

683
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:25,668
You said you would keep her safe.

684
01:18:25,793 --> 01:18:27,306
Lily and James...

685
01:18:27,585 --> 01:18:30,019
... put their faith in the wrong person,
Severus.

686
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:31,649
Rather like you.

687
01:18:34,945 --> 01:18:36,162
The boy survives.

688
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:38,555
He doesn't need protection,
the Dark Lord has gone.

689
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,296
The Dark Lord will return.

690
01:18:41,304 --> 01:18:43,797
And when he does, the boy
will be in terrible danger!

691
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,417
He has her eyes.

692
01:18:51,988 --> 01:18:54,412
If you truly loved her...

693
01:18:57,846 --> 01:19:01,776
No one, can know.

694
01:19:01,901 --> 01:19:04,254
<i>I shall never reveal the best of you,
Severus.</i>

695
01:19:04,569 --> 01:19:05,314
<i>Your word?</i>

696
01:19:05,706 --> 01:19:08,370
<i>Can you risk your life every day
to protect the boy?</i>

697
01:19:08,495 --> 01:19:14,423
<i>... He possesses no measurable talent, his arrogance rivals
even that of his father and he seems to relish in his fame...</i>

698
01:19:14,653 --> 01:19:16,611
<i>Don't say a word against my father!</i>

699
01:19:17,712 --> 01:19:21,494
<i>James Potter, lazy, arrogant.</i>

700
01:19:21,619 --> 01:19:24,994
<i>- My father was a great man!
- Your father was a swine!</i>

701
01:19:27,043 --> 01:19:32,223
Drink it, it will contain the curse to
your hand, for the time being.

702
01:19:32,621 --> 01:19:35,487
- It will spread, Albus.
- How long?

703
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:38,879
Maybe a year.

704
01:19:42,154 --> 01:19:43,192
Don't ignore me, Severus.

705
01:19:45,097 --> 01:19:48,927
We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered
the Malfoy boy to murder me.

706
01:19:51,296 --> 01:19:57,268
But should he fail, I should presume
the Dark Lord will turn to you.

707
01:20:00,537 --> 01:20:03,360
You must be the one to kill me,
Severus.

708
01:20:04,714 --> 01:20:06,308
It is the only way.

709
01:20:07,797 --> 01:20:12,039
Only then,
will the Dark Lord trust you completely.

710
01:20:18,371 --> 01:20:22,237
It will come a time, when Harry Potter,
must be told something.

711
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:29,867
But you must wait, until Voldemort
is at his most vulnerable.

712
01:20:30,613 --> 01:20:32,055
Must be told what?

713
01:20:33,616 --> 01:20:37,539
On the night, Lord Voldemort went
to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry...

714
01:20:39,859 --> 01:20:42,209
And Lily Potter cast
herself between them...

715
01:20:43,194 --> 01:20:45,056
... the curse rebounded.

716
01:20:47,149 --> 01:20:50,231
When that happens,
a part of Voldemort's soul...

717
01:20:50,604 --> 01:20:54,855
... latched itself onto the only
living thing it could find...

718
01:20:55,811 --> 01:20:57,144
... Harry himself.

719
01:20:59,566 --> 01:21:01,962
There's a reason Harry
can speak with snakes...

720
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:06,328
There's a reason he can look into
Lord Voldemort's mind...

721
01:21:08,547 --> 01:21:14,651
A part of Voldemort lives inside him.

722
01:21:21,079 --> 01:21:23,029
So, when the time comes...

723
01:21:24,999 --> 01:21:26,729
... the boy must die?

724
01:21:29,055 --> 01:21:32,599
Yes... yes.
He must die.

725
01:21:51,584 --> 01:21:55,409
You've kept him alive, so he can
die at the proper moment?

726
01:22:00,195 --> 01:22:02,793
You've been raising him
like a pig for slaughter.

727
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:07,078
Don't tell me now, that you've
grown to care for the boy.

728
01:22:27,071 --> 01:22:27,992
Lily!

729
01:22:31,767 --> 01:22:33,054
After all this time?

730
01:22:37,674 --> 01:22:38,818
Always.

731
01:22:44,954 --> 01:22:46,809
So, when the time comes...

732
01:22:48,334 --> 01:22:50,062
... the boy must die?

733
01:22:51,123 --> 01:22:52,045
Yes.

734
01:22:53,215 --> 01:22:56,990
He must die.
And Voldemort himself must do it.

735
01:22:58,272 --> 01:22:59,585
That is essential.

736
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:07,958
- Where've you been?
- I thought you went to the forest.

737
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:09,234
I'm going there now.

738
01:24:10,067 --> 01:24:11,957
Are you mad?
No...

739
01:24:13,771 --> 01:24:15,184
You can't give yourself up to him.

740
01:24:19,528 --> 01:24:20,626
What is it, Harry?

741
01:24:22,983 --> 01:24:24,079
What is it you know?

742
01:24:27,789 --> 01:24:29,488
There's a reason I can hear them.

743
01:24:30,993 --> 01:24:32,087
The Horcruxes.

744
01:24:34,728 --> 01:24:36,293
I think I've known for a while.

745
01:24:38,542 --> 01:24:39,976
And I think you have, too.

746
01:24:43,861 --> 01:24:46,313
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.

747
01:24:47,636 --> 01:24:49,512
Kill the snake,
and then it's just him!

748
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:11,409
I'm ready to die.

749
01:26:53,531 --> 01:26:55,103
Resurrection Stone.

750
01:27:25,663 --> 01:27:28,278
You've been so brave, sweetheart.

751
01:27:33,133 --> 01:27:36,809
Why are you here?
All of you.

752
01:27:39,892 --> 01:27:41,334
We never left.

753
01:27:50,977 --> 01:27:51,942
Does...

754
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:54,520
Does it hurt?

755
01:27:55,663 --> 01:27:56,779
Dying?

756
01:27:58,266 --> 01:28:00,286
Quicker than falling asleep.

757
01:28:04,691 --> 01:28:05,910
You're nearly there, son.

758
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:08,521
I'm sorry.

759
01:28:08,801 --> 01:28:11,149
I never wanted any
of you to die for me.

760
01:28:13,656 --> 01:28:14,911
And, Remus, your son?

761
01:28:15,399 --> 01:28:18,358
Others will tell him what his
mother and father died for.

762
01:28:19,845 --> 01:28:22,380
One day, he'll understand.

763
01:28:35,215 --> 01:28:36,228
You'll stay with me?

764
01:28:38,019 --> 01:28:39,515
Until the end.

765
01:28:41,183 --> 01:28:42,620
And he won't be able to see you?

766
01:28:43,325 --> 01:28:44,170
No.

767
01:28:46,324 --> 01:28:47,885
We're here, you see.

768
01:29:03,176 --> 01:29:04,730
Stay close to me.

769
01:29:07,358 --> 01:29:08,683
Always.

770
01:29:23,829 --> 01:29:26,563
No sign of him, My Lord.

771
01:29:43,175 --> 01:29:44,834
I thought he would come.

772
01:30:26,711 --> 01:30:28,732
Harry, no!

773
01:30:28,965 --> 01:30:31,423
- What're yeh doin' here?
- Quiet!

774
01:30:42,883 --> 01:30:44,182
Harry Potter...

775
01:30:48,190 --> 01:30:49,942
... The Boy Who Lived...

776
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:56,747
... come to die.

777
01:31:15,796 --> 01:31:18,349
<i>Avada Kedavra</i>

778
01:32:13,891 --> 01:32:15,109
You can't help...

779
01:32:16,806 --> 01:32:19,796
Harry, you wonderful boy...

780
01:32:20,972 --> 01:32:23,733
You brave, brave man!

781
01:32:26,909 --> 01:32:28,073
Let us walk.

782
01:32:36,332 --> 01:32:37,715
Professor, what is that?

783
01:32:41,339 --> 01:32:43,572
Something beyond either of our help.

784
01:32:47,247 --> 01:32:49,667
A part of Voldemort sent here to die.

785
01:32:50,861 --> 01:32:52,062
And exactly where are we?

786
01:32:53,254 --> 01:32:54,927
I was going to ask you that.

787
01:32:55,557 --> 01:32:56,939
Where would you say that we are?

788
01:32:57,610 --> 01:33:00,965
Well, it looks like
King's Cross station.

789
01:33:02,367 --> 01:33:03,879
Only cleaner...

790
01:33:04,769 --> 01:33:06,019
... and without all the trains.

791
01:33:07,483 --> 01:33:09,409
King's Cross, is that right?

792
01:33:10,579 --> 01:33:13,528
This is, as they say, 'your' party.

793
01:33:15,343 --> 01:33:17,854
I expect you now realize that
you and Voldemort...

794
01:33:18,768 --> 01:33:20,957
... have been connected by
something other than fate.

795
01:33:21,462 --> 01:33:24,375
Since that night in Godric's Hollow,
all those years ago.

796
01:33:24,735 --> 01:33:26,163
So it's true then, sir.

797
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,803
A part of him lives within me,
doesn't it?

798
01:33:29,913 --> 01:33:30,925
Did.

799
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:35,210
It's been just destroyed many moments
ago by none other than Voldemort himself.

800
01:33:37,082 --> 01:33:40,886
You, were the Horcrux he
never meant to make, Harry.

801
01:33:54,582 --> 01:33:57,965
- I have to go back, haven't I?
- Oh, that's up to you.

802
01:33:58,090 --> 01:34:00,956
- I've a choice?
- Oh, yes!

803
01:34:02,045 --> 01:34:03,816
We're in King's Cross, you say.

804
01:34:05,989 --> 01:34:10,724
I think if you so decide,
you'll be able to board a train.

805
01:34:12,158 --> 01:34:14,021
And where would it take me?

806
01:34:15,007 --> 01:34:15,990
On.

807
01:34:34,747 --> 01:34:36,355
Voldemort has the Elder Wand.

808
01:34:39,714 --> 01:34:40,524
True.

809
01:34:40,649 --> 01:34:42,035
And the snake's still alive?

810
01:34:42,348 --> 01:34:42,852
Yes.

811
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:45,539
And I've nothing to kill it with?

812
01:34:46,984 --> 01:34:49,173
Help will always be
given at Hogwarts, Harry.

813
01:34:49,507 --> 01:34:50,818
To those who ask for it.

814
01:34:52,792 --> 01:34:56,323
I've always pride of myself
on my ability to turn a phrase.

815
01:34:57,518 --> 01:34:59,844
Words are,
in my not so humble opinion...

816
01:35:00,812 --> 01:35:03,696
... are most inexhaustible
source of magic.

817
01:35:04,747 --> 01:35:08,271
Capable of inflicting
injury and remedies.

818
01:35:09,486 --> 01:35:11,035
But I would in this case...

819
01:35:11,906 --> 01:35:14,656
... amend my original
statement to this:

820
01:35:18,245 --> 01:35:21,168
Help, will always be
given at Hogwarts,

821
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:23,543
To those who deserve it.

822
01:35:30,271 --> 01:35:32,008
Do not pity the dead, Harry...

823
01:35:33,465 --> 01:35:34,650
Pity the living.

824
01:35:36,069 --> 01:35:37,410
And above all...

825
01:35:37,535 --> 01:35:39,932
... all those who live without love.

826
01:35:41,926 --> 01:35:43,828
Professor, my mother's Patronus...

827
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:46,970
... was a doe, wasn't it?

828
01:35:48,385 --> 01:35:50,268
As the same as Professor Snape's.

829
01:35:51,779 --> 01:35:54,033
It's curious, don't you think?

830
01:35:54,158 --> 01:35:55,841
Actually, if I think about it...

831
01:35:56,395 --> 01:35:58,079
... it doesn't seem curious at all!

832
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:02,113
I'll be going now, Harry.

833
01:36:03,415 --> 01:36:04,466
Professor?

834
01:36:09,413 --> 01:36:10,714
Is this all real?

835
01:36:12,194 --> 01:36:13,983
Or is it just happening
inside my head?

836
01:36:14,108 --> 01:36:16,676
Of course it's happening
inside your head, Harry.

837
01:36:17,923 --> 01:36:20,787
Why should that mean,
that it's not real?

838
01:36:27,235 --> 01:36:28,465
Professor?

839
01:36:29,038 --> 01:36:30,109
What should I do?

840
01:36:34,646 --> 01:36:35,731
Professor!

841
01:36:39,702 --> 01:36:41,831
My Lord, My Lord...

842
01:36:41,956 --> 01:36:42,942
Are you hurt?

843
01:36:43,457 --> 01:36:45,194
I don't need your help.

844
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:57,275
The boy...

845
01:36:58,727 --> 01:36:59,741
Is he dead?

846
01:37:14,838 --> 01:37:15,840
Is he alive?

847
01:37:17,112 --> 01:37:18,528
Draco, is he alive?

848
01:37:46,039 --> 01:37:46,721
Dead.

849
01:39:14,656 --> 01:39:15,267
Who is that?

850
01:39:16,048 --> 01:39:17,019
Hagrid's carrying?

851
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:19,103
Neville, who is it?

852
01:39:20,604 --> 01:39:22,120
Harry Potter...

853
01:39:24,138 --> 01:39:26,216
- is dead!
- No!

854
01:39:26,446 --> 01:39:27,290
No!

855
01:39:27,173 --> 01:39:28,016
Silence!

856
01:39:32,569 --> 01:39:34,223
Stupid girl!

857
01:39:35,854 --> 01:39:37,063
Harry Potter...

858
01:39:37,666 --> 01:39:38,588
... is dead!

859
01:39:39,489 --> 01:39:40,990
From this day forth...

860
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:45,926
... you'll put your faith in me.

861
01:39:56,411 --> 01:39:58,246
Harry Potter is dead!

862
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:05,901
And now it's the time
to declare yourself.

863
01:40:08,627 --> 01:40:10,244
Come forward and join us...

864
01:40:13,085 --> 01:40:14,300
... or die!

865
01:40:20,743 --> 01:40:21,161
Draco!

866
01:40:27,251 --> 01:40:28,029
Draco.

867
01:40:32,057 --> 01:40:32,933
Draco.

868
01:40:36,714 --> 01:40:37,420
Come.

869
01:40:50,792 --> 01:40:52,889
Well done, Draco.

870
01:40:53,786 --> 01:40:54,837
Well done!

871
01:41:18,168 --> 01:41:20,592
Well, I must say I'd
hoped for better.

872
01:41:25,428 --> 01:41:27,406
And who might you be, young man?

873
01:41:29,653 --> 01:41:30,755
Neville Longbottom.

874
01:41:36,843 --> 01:41:40,462
Well, Neville, I'm sure we can
find a place for you in our rank.

875
01:41:40,587 --> 01:41:42,050
I'd like to say something.

876
01:41:49,159 --> 01:41:53,662
Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be
fascinated to hear what you have to say.

877
01:41:57,971 --> 01:42:00,198
- Doesn't matter that Harry is gone.
- Stand down, Neville!

878
01:42:00,323 --> 01:42:01,736
People die everyday!

879
01:42:04,659 --> 01:42:07,970
Friends, family.

880
01:42:10,868 --> 01:42:11,551
Yeah...

881
01:42:13,892 --> 01:42:15,157
We lost Harry tonight.

882
01:42:17,697 --> 01:42:18,648
He's still with us.

883
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:20,993
In here.

884
01:42:23,104 --> 01:42:26,851
So as Fred, Remus...

885
01:42:28,822 --> 01:42:29,632
Tonks...

886
01:42:31,615 --> 01:42:32,346
All of them.

887
01:42:34,669 --> 01:42:36,542
They didn't die in vain.

888
01:42:42,029 --> 01:42:42,986
But you will.

889
01:42:43,631 --> 01:42:44,584
Because you're wrong!

890
01:42:45,834 --> 01:42:47,127
Harry's heart did beat for us.

891
01:42:47,936 --> 01:42:48,700
For all of us!

892
01:42:49,258 --> 01:42:50,332
It's not over!

893
01:42:54,945 --> 01:42:55,699
<i>Confringo</i>

894
01:43:07,963 --> 01:43:08,744
Come on!

895
01:43:17,825 --> 01:43:19,108
All remain into the castle.

896
01:43:19,348 --> 01:43:20,482
We have to kill the snake.

897
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:22,150
Neville!

898
01:46:16,661 --> 01:46:18,855
Not my daughter, you bitch!

899
01:46:52,708 --> 01:46:53,730
Hey, you were right...

900
01:46:55,863 --> 01:46:57,940
... when you told Professor Snape
that wand was failing you.

901
01:46:58,065 --> 01:46:58,836
It will always fail...

902
01:47:01,230 --> 01:47:02,731
I killed Snape!

903
01:47:03,072 --> 01:47:04,654
But what if the wand never belonged
to Snape?

904
01:47:05,245 --> 01:47:06,999
What if its allegiance is always
to someone else?

905
01:47:08,379 --> 01:47:09,356
Oh, come on, Tom...

906
01:47:09,481 --> 01:47:10,897
Let's finish this the way we started.

907
01:47:12,434 --> 01:47:13,110
Together!

908
01:48:12,664 --> 01:48:13,715
Die!

909
01:50:59,463 --> 01:51:00,052
Harry!

910
01:52:01,164 --> 01:52:02,127
Why didn't it work for him?

911
01:52:02,917 --> 01:52:03,857
The Elder Wand?

912
01:52:05,870 --> 01:52:07,382
It answered to somebody else.

913
01:52:08,724 --> 01:52:11,363
When he killed Snape, he thought
the wand would become his.

914
01:52:11,488 --> 01:52:12,078
But the thing is...

915
01:52:13,681 --> 01:52:15,958
The wand never belonged to Snape.

916
01:52:16,083 --> 01:52:19,402
It was Draco, who disarmed Dumbledore
that night in the Astronomy tower.

917
01:52:20,689 --> 01:52:23,688
From that moment on and the wand
answered him,

918
01:52:25,596 --> 01:52:29,727
Until, the other night
when I disarmed Draco.

919
01:52:30,452 --> 01:52:31,474
At Malfoy Manor.

920
01:52:32,345 --> 01:52:33,321
So, that means...

921
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:36,641
It's mine!

922
01:52:39,835 --> 01:52:42,233
- What should we do with it?
- We?

923
01:52:43,699 --> 01:52:45,027
Just saying, that's the Elder Wand.

924
01:52:45,822 --> 01:52:47,631
The most powerful wand in the world.

925
01:52:48,476 --> 01:52:50,969
With that, he'd be invincible.

926
01:55:15,019 --> 01:55:15,710
Together.

927
01:55:55,462 --> 01:55:56,611
- Bag?
- Yeah.

928
01:55:57,454 --> 01:55:58,196
Jumper?

929
01:56:00,178 --> 01:56:00,970
I'm gonna miss you.

930
01:56:02,992 --> 01:56:03,423
Here they come.

931
01:56:20,005 --> 01:56:20,706
Dad?

932
01:56:21,637 --> 01:56:23,393
What if I am put in Slytherin?

933
01:56:26,523 --> 01:56:32,991
Albus Severus Potter. You were named
after two Headmasters of Hogwarts.

934
01:56:34,124 --> 01:56:38,945
One of them was a Slytherin. And he
was the bravest man I've ever known.

935
01:56:41,153 --> 01:56:43,946
- But just say if I am...
- Then Slytherin house...

936
01:56:44,427 --> 01:56:47,301
... will have gained a
wonderful young wizard.

937
01:56:48,642 --> 01:56:49,733
But listen...

938
01:56:50,224 --> 01:56:53,418
If it really means that much to you,
you can choose Gryffindor.

939
01:56:54,249 --> 01:56:56,621
The Sorting Hat takes
your choice into account.

940
01:56:57,754 --> 01:56:59,716
- Really?
- Really.

941
01:57:03,972 --> 01:57:05,759
- Ready?
- Ready.
