1
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:41,248
These are dark times, there is no denying.

2
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,492
Our world has, perhaps,
faced no greater threat than it does today.

3
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:52,425
But I say this to our citizenry:

4
00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:56,506
We, ever your servants...

5
00:00:56,675 --> 00:00:59,337
...will continue to defend your liberty...

6
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:03,845
...and repel the forces
that seek to take it from you.

7
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:10,317
Your Ministry remains...

8
00:01:10,855 --> 00:01:12,823
...strong.

9
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:32,370
Hermione. Tea's ready, darling.

10
00:01:32,544 --> 00:01:34,478
Coming, Mom.

11
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,316
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

12
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:43,511
I still don't understand
why we have to leave.

13
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:48,455
Because, unh,
it's not safe for us here anymore.

14
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:08,211
Ron, tell your father
supper's nearly ready.

15
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:14,947
Is this in Australia?

16
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,088
Looks wonderful, doesn't it?

17
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:22,124
Three and a half thousand
kilometers along Australia's east coast.

18
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:24,952
Obliviate.

19
00:04:39,297 --> 00:04:40,958
Severus.

20
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:44,499
I was beginning to worry
you had lost your way.

21
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:48,127
Come, we've saved you a seat.

22
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:53,908
You bring news, I trust?

23
00:04:54,078 --> 00:04:57,741
It will happen Saturday next, at nightfall.

24
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,282
I've heard differently, my Lord.

25
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:03,579
Dawlish, the Auror,
has let slip that the Potter boy...

26
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:06,849
...will not be moved
until the 30th of this month.

27
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:08,554
The day before he turns 17.

28
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,957
This is a false trail.

29
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,794
The Auror Office no longer plays any part
in the protection of Harry Potter.

30
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:21,337
Those closest to him believe
we have infiltrated the Ministry.

31
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,532
Well, they got that right, haven't they?

32
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:30,480
What say you, Pius?

33
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:36,612
One hears many things, my Lord.

34
00:05:36,788 --> 00:05:39,348
Whether the truth is among them
is not clear.

35
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:42,891
Heh. Spoken like a true politician.

36
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:46,121
You will, I think,
prove most useful, Pius.

37
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:52,965
- Where will he be taken, the boy?
- To a safe house.

38
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:55,999
Most likely the home of someone
in the Order.

39
00:05:56,174 --> 00:05:59,405
I'm told it's been given
every manner of protection possible.

40
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:03,172
Once there,
it will be impractical to attack him.

41
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:08,285
Ahem. My Lord.
I'd like to volunteer myself for this task.

42
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:09,442
I want to kill the boy.

43
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,016
Wormtail!

44
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,159
Have I not spoken to you
about keeping our guest quiet?

45
00:06:15,326 --> 00:06:17,226
Yes, my Lord.

46
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:20,057
Right away, my Lord.

47
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:24,792
As inspiring
as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix...

48
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:28,535
...I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.

49
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:35,810
But I face an unfortunate complication.

50
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:41,179
That my wand and Potter's
share the same core.

51
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:48,984
They are, in some ways, twins.

52
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,859
We can wound,
but not fatally harm one another.

53
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:58,264
If I am to kill him...

54
00:06:58,937 --> 00:07:02,703
...I must do it with another's wand.

55
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:10,409
Come,
surely one of you would like the honor?

56
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:13,677
Mm?

57
00:07:15,386 --> 00:07:20,187
What about you, Lucius?

58
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:24,093
My Lord?

59
00:07:24,262 --> 00:07:26,230
"My Lord?"

60
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:30,927
I require your wand.

61
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:46,716
Do I detect elm?

62
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:48,852
Yes, my Lord.

63
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:57,727
And the core?

64
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,090
Dragon. Ahem.

65
00:08:00,264 --> 00:08:01,891
Dragon heartstring, my Lord.

66
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:04,261
- Dragon heartstring.
- Mm.

67
00:08:19,984 --> 00:08:21,747
To those of you who do not know...

68
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,581
...we are joined tonight
by Miss Charity Burbage...

69
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:30,251
...who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

70
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:33,886
Her specialty was Muggle Studies.

71
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:43,370
It is Miss Burbage's belief
that Muggles are not so different from us.

72
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:47,170
She would, given her way...

73
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,879
...have us mate with them.

74
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:59,751
To her, the mixture of magical
and Muggle blood is not an abomination...

75
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:02,950
...but something to be encouraged.

76
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:05,893
Severus.

77
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:08,032
Severus, please.

78
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,861
We're friends.

79
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:18,199
Avada Kedavra!

80
00:09:28,453 --> 00:09:30,478
Nagini.

81
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:35,753
Dinner.

82
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:24,466
- Hello, Harry.
- All right. Wow.

83
00:11:24,635 --> 00:11:25,727
Hello.

84
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:28,804
- You're looking fit.
- Yeah, he's absolutely gorgeous.

85
00:11:28,973 --> 00:11:31,441
What say we get undercover
before someone murders him?

86
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:32,633
Evening.

87
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:39,948
I thought you were
looking after the Prime Minister.

88
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,017
You are more important.

89
00:11:42,186 --> 00:11:45,246
- Hello, Harry. Bill Weasley.
- Oh. Pleasure to meet you.

90
00:11:45,423 --> 00:11:48,415
- He was never always this handsome.
- Dead ugly.

91
00:11:48,593 --> 00:11:49,992
True enough.

92
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:52,686
Owe it all to a werewolf,
name of Greyback.

93
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:56,230
- Hope to repay the favor one day.
- You're still beautiful to me, William.

94
00:11:56,601 --> 00:12:00,230
Just remember, Fleur,
Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now.

95
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:02,736
My husband, the joker.

96
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:06,172
By the way, wait till you hear the news.
Remus and I--

97
00:12:06,344 --> 00:12:08,778
All right. We'll have time
for a cozy catch-up later.

98
00:12:08,946 --> 00:12:11,915
We've got to get the hell out of here.
And soon.

99
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,848
Potter, you're underage, which means
you've still got the Trace on you.

100
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,044
What's the Trace?

101
00:12:17,221 --> 00:12:19,883
If you sneeze, the Ministry will know
who wipes your nose.

102
00:12:20,057 --> 00:12:23,220
We have to use those means of transport
the Trace can't detect:

103
00:12:23,394 --> 00:12:25,726
Brooms, Thestrals and the like.
We go in pairs.

104
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:29,662
That way, if anyone's out there waiting
for us, and I reckon there will be...

105
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:32,325
...they won't know which Harry Potter
is the real one.

106
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,930
The real one?

107
00:12:35,273 --> 00:12:38,367
I believe you're familiar
with this particular brew.

108
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,840
No. Absolutely not.

109
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:42,343
I told you he'd take it well.

110
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:45,641
No, if you think I'm gonna let everyone
risk their lives for me, I--

111
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:48,876
- Never done that before, have we?
- No. No. This is different.

112
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:51,044
I mean, taking that, becoming me. No.

113
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:53,053
Well, none of us really fancy it, mate.

114
00:12:53,224 --> 00:12:57,388
Imagine if something went wrong, and
we ended up a scrawny, specky git forever.

115
00:12:57,561 --> 00:12:59,222
Everyone here is of age, Potter.

116
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,363
They've all agreed to take the risk.

117
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:05,634
Technically, I've been coerced.

118
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:07,998
Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter.

119
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:10,732
- Always been a huge admirer.
- Nip it, Mundungus.

120
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:14,534
All right, Granger, as discussed.

121
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:17,442
- Blimey, Hermione.
- Straight in here, if you please.

122
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:31,489
For those of you who haven't taken
Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning:

123
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:33,289
It tastes like goblin piss.

124
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:36,433
Have a lot of experiences with that,
do you, Mad-Eye?

125
00:13:37,335 --> 00:13:40,270
Just trying to diffuse the tension.

126
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:43,102
Oh.

127
00:13:46,177 --> 00:13:47,940
Ugh.

128
00:14:12,203 --> 00:14:14,262
Wow, we're identical.

129
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,496
Not yet, you're not.

130
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:21,736
Haven't got anything
a bit more sporting, have you?

131
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:23,379
I don't really fancy this color.

132
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:26,345
Well, fancy this, you're not you.
So shut it and strip.

133
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:28,075
All right, all right.

134
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:29,810
You'll need to change too, Potter.

135
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:32,949
Bill, look away. I'm hideous.

136
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:35,422
I knew she was lying about that tattoo.

137
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:38,027
Harry, your eyesight really is awful.

138
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:41,892
Right, then. We'll be pairing off.
Each Potter will have a protector.

139
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:45,365
Mundungus, stick tight to me.
I wanna keep an eye on you.

140
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:47,734
- As for Harry--
- Yes?

141
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:49,971
The real Harry.

142
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:52,507
- Where the devil are you, anyway?
- Here.

143
00:14:52,676 --> 00:14:54,644
You'll ride with Hagrid.

144
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:59,840
I brought you here 16 years ago when
you were no bigger than a Bowtruckle.

145
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:02,918
Seems only right that I should be
the one to take you away now.

146
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:06,022
Yes, it's all very touching. Let's go.

147
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:23,238
Head for the Burrows.
We'll rendezvous there.

148
00:15:23,774 --> 00:15:25,833
On the count of three.

149
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,739
Hold tight, Harry.

150
00:15:27,912 --> 00:15:29,709
One...

151
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:32,378
...two...

152
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:40,586
...three!

153
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:13,751
- Which one?
- Where are you?

154
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,688
He's on your right!

155
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:18,488
He's over there!

156
00:16:18,662 --> 00:16:20,323
Down!

157
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:27,464
Hagrid, we have to help the others!

158
00:16:27,872 --> 00:16:30,773
I can't do that, Harry. Mad-Eye's orders.

159
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:39,512
Hang on.

160
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,379
Stupefy!

161
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:00,195
Hang on, Harry.

162
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:11,979
Hagrid.

163
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:31,463
No. No.

164
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:55,548
Harry.

165
00:19:15,506 --> 00:19:18,566
Harry. Hagrid.

166
00:19:19,977 --> 00:19:23,435
What happened? Where are the others?

167
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:24,774
Is no one else back?

168
00:19:24,948 --> 00:19:28,509
They were on us right from
the start, Molly. We didn't stand a chance.

169
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:31,849
Well, thank goodness
you two are all right.

170
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:34,582
The Death Eaters were
waiting for us. It was an ambush.

171
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,158
Ron and Tonks
should've already been back.

172
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:38,521
Dad and Fred as well.

173
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:43,126
Here!

174
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:47,203
Quick. Into the house.

175
00:19:50,874 --> 00:19:52,933
Oh, my boy.

176
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,603
Oh. Oh.

177
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:00,513
- Lupin!
- What are you doing?

178
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:05,988
What creature sat in the corner...

179
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:09,455
...the first time Harry Potter
visited my office in Hogwarts?

180
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,253
- Are you mad?
- What creature?!

181
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:13,259
A Grindylow.

182
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:21,264
We've been betrayed.

183
00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:23,838
Voldemort knew
you were being moved tonight.

184
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:26,908
I had to make sure
you weren't an impostor.

185
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:35,484
Wait.

186
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:43,017
The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke
to the pair of us?

187
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:49,197
"Harry is the best hope we have.
Trust him."

188
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:54,829
What gave you away?

189
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:58,202
Hedwig, I think.
She was trying to protect me.

190
00:21:14,758 --> 00:21:15,918
Thanks.

191
00:21:16,093 --> 00:21:18,254
Deserves that. Brilliant, he was.

192
00:21:18,428 --> 00:21:21,522
- I wouldn't be standing here without him.
- Really?

193
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:25,195
Always the tone of surprise.

194
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,604
We the last back?

195
00:21:35,913 --> 00:21:36,937
Where's George?

196
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,465
How you feeling, Georgie?

197
00:22:02,472 --> 00:22:03,996
Saint-like.

198
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:06,437
Come again?

199
00:22:07,377 --> 00:22:10,938
Saint-like. I'm holy.

200
00:22:11,448 --> 00:22:14,508
I'm holey, Fred. Get it?

201
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,019
The whole wide world of ear-related humor
and you go for "I'm holey."

202
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:22,351
That's pathetic.

203
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,258
Reckon I'm still better-looking than you.

204
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,994
Mad-Eye's dead.

205
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:45,109
Mundungus took one look at Voldemort
and Disapparated.

206
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:10,063
Head for the Burrows.

207
00:23:10,874 --> 00:23:12,239
This is beyond anything I imagined.

208
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:15,037
- Seven?
- Seven...? A Horcrux.

209
00:23:15,212 --> 00:23:16,645
They could be hidden anywhere.

210
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:19,008
To rip the soul into seven pieces....

211
00:23:19,182 --> 00:23:22,151
- If you did destroy each Horcrux....
- One destroys Voldemort.

212
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:27,383
Trust me.

213
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:31,886
You lied to me. Lied to me, Ollivander.

214
00:24:03,827 --> 00:24:05,761
Going somewhere?

215
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:13,529
Nobody else is going to die. Not for me.

216
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:15,501
For you?

217
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:17,902
You think Mad-Eye died for you?

218
00:24:18,075 --> 00:24:21,010
You think George took that curse
for you?

219
00:24:21,778 --> 00:24:25,714
You may be the Chosen One, mate,
but this is a whole lot bigger than that.

220
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:28,407
It's always been bigger than that.

221
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,111
- Come with me.
- What, and leave Hermione?

222
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,822
You mad?
We wouldn't last two days without her.

223
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:40,753
Don't tell her I said that.

224
00:24:42,332 --> 00:24:45,529
Besides,
you've still got the Trace on you.

225
00:24:45,702 --> 00:24:49,798
- We've still got the wedding--
- I don't care about a wedding.

226
00:24:49,973 --> 00:24:54,842
I'm sorry. No matter whose it is.
I have to start finding these Horcruxes.

227
00:24:55,012 --> 00:24:56,980
They're our only chance to beat him...

228
00:24:57,147 --> 00:25:00,116
...and the longer we stay here,
the stronger he gets.

229
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:03,644
Tonight's not the night, mate.

230
00:25:03,954 --> 00:25:06,422
We'd only be doing him a favor.

231
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:36,118
Do you think he knows?

232
00:25:36,853 --> 00:25:42,723
I mean, they're bits of his soul,
these Horcruxes. Bits of him.

233
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,726
When Dumbledore destroyed the ring,
you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary...

234
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:51,826
...he must have felt something.

235
00:25:52,602 --> 00:25:56,333
To kill the other Horcruxes,
we have to find them.

236
00:25:56,706 --> 00:25:58,674
Where are they?

237
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:01,268
Where do we start?

238
00:26:04,714 --> 00:26:05,806
Ready when you are.

239
00:26:07,551 --> 00:26:11,851
Please pay attention!
It's your brother's wedding. Buck up.

240
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,339
Zip me up, will you?

241
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:55,130
It seems silly, doesn't it, a wedding?

242
00:26:55,632 --> 00:26:57,998
Given everything that's going on.

243
00:26:59,336 --> 00:27:01,395
Maybe that's the best reason to have it...

244
00:27:02,005 --> 00:27:04,530
...because of everything that's going on.

245
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,751
Morning.

246
00:27:32,936 --> 00:27:35,097
Come on, keep up.

247
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:37,433
All together now.

248
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:43,045
One, two, three.

249
00:27:53,123 --> 00:27:55,557
How's it looking at your end, boys?

250
00:27:56,193 --> 00:27:58,127
Brilliant.

251
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:05,065
Bloody hell.
What's the Minister of Magic doing here?

252
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:12,839
To what do we owe the pleasure,
Minister?

253
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:17,571
I think we both know the answer
to that question, Mr. Potter.

254
00:28:25,255 --> 00:28:27,155
And this is...?

255
00:28:35,198 --> 00:28:39,100
"Herein is set forth
the last will and testament...

256
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:43,865
...of Albus Percival Wulfric
Brian Dumbledore.

257
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,500
First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley...

258
00:28:48,678 --> 00:28:51,977
...I leave my Deluminator...

259
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,412
...a device of my own making...

260
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:59,817
...in the hope that,
when things seem most dark...

261
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:04,325
...it will show him the light."

262
00:29:10,233 --> 00:29:13,327
- Dumbledore left this for me?
- Yeah.

263
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:15,863
Brilliant.

264
00:29:16,906 --> 00:29:18,737
What is it?

265
00:29:30,887 --> 00:29:32,479
Wicked.

266
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:37,760
"To Hermione Jean Granger...

267
00:29:37,927 --> 00:29:43,092
...I leave my copy of
The Tales of Beedle the Bard...

268
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:47,930
...in the hope that she find it
entertaining and instructive."

269
00:29:48,738 --> 00:29:50,069
Mom used to read me those.

270
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,464
"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot."

271
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:55,577
"Babbitty Rabbitty
and the Cackling Stump."

272
00:29:57,347 --> 00:30:00,714
Come on, Babbitty Rabbitty.

273
00:30:01,184 --> 00:30:02,879
No?

274
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:06,017
"To Harry James Potter...

275
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:10,287
...I leave the Snitch he caught
in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts...

276
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:15,488
...as a reminder
of the rewards of perseverance...

277
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:19,929
...and skill."

278
00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:43,049
- Is that it, then?
- Not quite.

279
00:30:43,226 --> 00:30:48,630
Dumbledore left you a second bequest:

280
00:30:48,865 --> 00:30:51,857
The sword of Godric Gryffindor.

281
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:58,066
Unfortunately, the sword of Gryffindor
was not Dumbledore's to give away.

282
00:30:58,475 --> 00:31:01,205
As an important historical artifact,
it belongs--

283
00:31:01,378 --> 00:31:02,470
To Harry.

284
00:31:03,313 --> 00:31:05,247
It belongs to Harry.

285
00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:08,111
It came to him when he needed it
in the Chamber of Secrets.

286
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:11,185
The sword may present itself
to any worthy Gryffindor.

287
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:13,686
That does not make it
that wizard's property.

288
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:18,754
And, in any event, the current
whereabouts of the sword are unknown.

289
00:31:18,928 --> 00:31:21,522
- Excuse me?
- The sword is missing.

290
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:26,426
I don't know what you're up to,
Mr. Potter...

291
00:31:26,603 --> 00:31:30,562
...but you can't fight this war
on your own.

292
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,140
He's too strong.

293
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:35,599
Hello, Harry.

294
00:32:36,506 --> 00:32:40,499
I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I?
I can see it growing smaller in your eyes.

295
00:32:40,677 --> 00:32:42,201
Of course not. How are you, Luna?

296
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:45,006
Very well. Got bitten by a garden gnome
only moments ago.

297
00:32:45,181 --> 00:32:47,513
Gnome saliva is very beneficial.

298
00:32:47,684 --> 00:32:50,050
Xenophilius Lovegood.
We live just over the hill.

299
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,414
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

300
00:32:51,588 --> 00:32:54,352
I trust you know, Mr. Potter,
that we at The Quibbler...

301
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:56,856
...unlike those toadies
at The Daily Prophet...

302
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:59,620
...fully supported Dumbledore
in his lifetime...

303
00:32:59,796 --> 00:33:03,459
...and, in his death,
support you just as fully.

304
00:33:03,766 --> 00:33:05,131
Thank you.

305
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:08,134
Come, Daddy.
Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.

306
00:33:08,304 --> 00:33:10,602
He's just too polite to say so.

307
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:12,832
Harry Potter.

308
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:18,506
Excuse me, sir? May I sit down?

309
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:22,082
Mr. Potter. By all means. Here.

310
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:23,913
Thanks.

311
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:29,922
I found what you wrote
in The Daily Prophet really moving.

312
00:33:30,493 --> 00:33:33,291
You obviously knew Dumbledore well.

313
00:33:33,463 --> 00:33:36,398
Well, I certainly knew him the longest.

314
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:39,296
That is, if you don't count his brother,
Aberforth...

315
00:33:39,469 --> 00:33:42,495
...and somehow, people never do
seem to count Aberforth.

316
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:44,898
- I didn't even know he had a brother.
- Ah.

317
00:33:45,074 --> 00:33:48,635
Well, Dumbledore was always
very private, even as a boy.

318
00:33:48,811 --> 00:33:50,210
Don't despair, Elphias.

319
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,817
I'm told he's been thoroughly
unriddled by Rita Skeeter...

320
00:33:54,984 --> 00:33:57,817
...in 800 pages, no less.

321
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:02,857
Word has it that someone talked to her.

322
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:05,824
Someone who knew
the Dumbledore family well.

323
00:34:06,229 --> 00:34:09,824
Both you and I know who that is,
Elphias.

324
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:11,466
A monstrous betrayal.

325
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:14,961
Who are we talking about?

326
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:18,566
Bathilda Bagshot.

327
00:34:20,243 --> 00:34:21,301
- Who?
- My God, boy...

328
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:26,244
...she's only the most celebrated
magical historian of the last century.

329
00:34:27,951 --> 00:34:32,183
She was as close
to the Dumbledores as anyone.

330
00:34:32,355 --> 00:34:37,383
Oh, I'm sure Rita Skeeter thought
it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow...

331
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,757
...to take a peek
into that old bird's rattled cage.

332
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,761
Godric's Hollow?

333
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,099
Bathilda Bagshot
lives at Godric's Hollow?

334
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,594
Well, that's where
she first met Dumbledore.

335
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,635
You don't mean to say
he lived there too?

336
00:34:49,806 --> 00:34:53,367
The family moved there
after his father killed those three Muggles.

337
00:34:53,543 --> 00:34:57,172
Oh, it was quite the scandal.

338
00:34:57,347 --> 00:35:02,182
Honestly, my boy,
are you sure you knew him at all?

339
00:35:28,645 --> 00:35:31,739
The Ministry has fallen.

340
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:36,284
The Minister of Magic is dead.

341
00:35:38,755 --> 00:35:41,053
They are coming.

342
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:43,317
They are coming.

343
00:35:44,594 --> 00:35:46,084
They are coming.

344
00:35:46,262 --> 00:35:47,729
They're coming!

345
00:35:49,766 --> 00:35:51,597
Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter.

346
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:05,045
- Ginny!
- Harry! Go!

347
00:36:05,214 --> 00:36:06,272
Go!

348
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:22,189
Here you go, sightseeing tour?
Leaves in 15 minutes.

349
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:26,261
- Where are we?
- Shaftesbury Avenue.

350
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:29,633
I used to come to the theater here
with Mom and Dad.

351
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:33,033
I don't know why I thought of it.
It just popped into my head.

352
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:35,274
This way.

353
00:36:39,082 --> 00:36:41,175
We need to change.

354
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:48,385
How the ruddy...?

355
00:36:48,558 --> 00:36:51,118
Undetectable Extension Charm.

356
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:53,825
You're amazing, you are.

357
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,590
Always the tone of surprise.

358
00:36:58,601 --> 00:37:00,728
Ah. That'll be the books.

359
00:37:06,242 --> 00:37:08,107
What about all the people
at the wedding?

360
00:37:08,277 --> 00:37:10,745
- Do you think we should go back?
- They were after you.

361
00:37:10,913 --> 00:37:13,074
We'd put everyone in danger
by going back.

362
00:37:14,951 --> 00:37:16,680
- Ron's right.
- Ahem.

363
00:37:16,853 --> 00:37:18,514
Coffee?

364
00:37:19,055 --> 00:37:22,081
- A cappuccino, please.
- You?

365
00:37:22,925 --> 00:37:26,224
- What she said.
- Same.

366
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,433
So where do we go from here?
Leaky Cauldron?

367
00:37:33,803 --> 00:37:34,895
It's too dangerous.

368
00:37:35,805 --> 00:37:39,332
If Voldemort has taken over the Ministry,
none of the old places are safe.

369
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:42,569
Everyone from the wedding
will have gone underground, into hiding.

370
00:37:42,745 --> 00:37:45,236
My rucksack with all my things,
I've left it at the Burrow.

371
00:37:50,386 --> 00:37:52,286
You're joking.

372
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:57,849
I've had all the essentials packed
for days, just in case.

373
00:37:58,027 --> 00:38:00,222
By the way, these jeans, not my favorite.

374
00:38:01,397 --> 00:38:02,455
Down!

375
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,896
Stupefy!

376
00:38:09,105 --> 00:38:10,834
Expulso!

377
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,581
Petrificus Totalus.

378
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:27,780
Go.

379
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:29,384
Leave.

380
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:36,861
Lock the door, get the lights.

381
00:38:46,108 --> 00:38:47,837
This one's name is Rowle.

382
00:38:48,344 --> 00:38:51,780
He was on the Astronomy Tower
the night Snape killed Dumbledore.

383
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:57,076
This is Dolohov. I recognize him
from the wanted posters.

384
00:38:58,154 --> 00:39:00,315
So, what we gonna do with you, hey?

385
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,283
Kill us if it was turned round,
wouldn't you?

386
00:39:03,459 --> 00:39:04,790
If we kill them, they'll know we were here.

387
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:06,360
Ron.

388
00:39:06,529 --> 00:39:10,488
Suppose he did Mad-Eye.
How would you feel then?

389
00:39:12,468 --> 00:39:14,095
It's better we wipe their memories.

390
00:39:14,971 --> 00:39:16,939
You're the boss.

391
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,003
Hermione...

392
00:39:21,477 --> 00:39:23,945
...you're the best at spells.

393
00:39:41,597 --> 00:39:43,792
Obliviate.

394
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:57,737
How is it they knew we were there?

395
00:39:57,914 --> 00:39:59,506
Maybe you still have the Trace on you?

396
00:39:59,682 --> 00:40:03,118
Can't be. Trace breaks at 17.
It's wizarding law.

397
00:40:04,921 --> 00:40:06,479
What?

398
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,259
We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry.

399
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:13,891
Ginny and I, we prepared a cake.

400
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:17,032
We were going to bring it out
at the end of the wedding.

401
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:20,635
I appreciate the thought, but given the fact
that we were almost killed...

402
00:40:20,803 --> 00:40:23,203
...by a couple of Death Eaters
a few minutes ago....

403
00:40:24,874 --> 00:40:26,569
Right.

404
00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:28,400
Perspective.

405
00:40:28,577 --> 00:40:31,569
We need to get off the streets,
get somewhere safe.

406
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,705
What was that all about?

407
00:41:07,683 --> 00:41:13,519
Probably Mad-Eye's idea,
in case Snape decided to come snooping.

408
00:41:21,697 --> 00:41:23,665
Homenum Revelio.

409
00:41:30,306 --> 00:41:32,137
We're alone.

410
00:41:38,948 --> 00:41:41,178
I believed another wand--

411
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,818
- You lied to me.
- It makes no sense.

412
00:41:46,655 --> 00:41:49,624
I believed a different wand would work,
I swear.

413
00:41:51,127 --> 00:41:53,186
There must be another way.

414
00:43:03,532 --> 00:43:07,263
Harry? Hermione, where are you?

415
00:43:07,536 --> 00:43:09,868
I think I've found something.

416
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:17,236
Lovely.

417
00:43:22,918 --> 00:43:26,410
"Regulus Arcturus Black."

418
00:43:26,589 --> 00:43:28,284
R.A.B.

419
00:43:31,894 --> 00:43:35,193
"I know I will be dead
long before you read this.

420
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:39,391
I have stolen the real Horcrux
and intend to destroy it."

421
00:43:39,768 --> 00:43:42,168
R.A.B. is Sirius's brother.

422
00:43:42,605 --> 00:43:44,368
Yes.

423
00:43:46,475 --> 00:43:50,343
Question is,
did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?

424
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:14,228
You've been spying on us, have you?

425
00:44:14,403 --> 00:44:18,863
Kreacher has been watching.

426
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:20,975
Maybe he knows where the real locket is.

427
00:44:23,979 --> 00:44:25,913
Have you ever seen this before?

428
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,673
Kreacher?

429
00:44:28,517 --> 00:44:30,951
It's Master Regulus' locket.

430
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,816
But there were two, weren't there?

431
00:44:34,823 --> 00:44:36,518
Where's the other one?

432
00:44:39,028 --> 00:44:43,590
Kreacher doesn't know
where the other locket is.

433
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:46,166
Yes, but did you ever see it?
Was it in this house?

434
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:47,495
Filthy Mudblood.

435
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:49,365
- Death Eaters are coming--
- Ron.

436
00:44:49,538 --> 00:44:52,371
- Blood traitor, Weasley.
- Answer her.

437
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,373
Yes.

438
00:44:57,413 --> 00:45:00,871
It was here in this house.

439
00:45:02,151 --> 00:45:04,483
A most evil object.

440
00:45:04,653 --> 00:45:05,881
How do you mean?

441
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:10,955
Before Master Regulus died,
he ordered Kreacher to destroy it...

442
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:16,393
...but no matter how hard Kreacher tried,
he could not do it.

443
00:45:16,565 --> 00:45:18,157
Well, where is it now?

444
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:23,397
- Did someone take it?
- He came in the night.

445
00:45:23,572 --> 00:45:28,236
He took many things,
including the locket.

446
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:29,934
Who did?

447
00:45:30,613 --> 00:45:32,205
Who was it, Kreacher?

448
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,412
Mundungus.

449
00:45:37,586 --> 00:45:41,078
Mundungus Fletcher.

450
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:43,749
Find him.

451
00:46:05,281 --> 00:46:06,748
My father will hear about this.

452
00:46:12,054 --> 00:46:13,919
Hey, losers.

453
00:46:14,657 --> 00:46:16,921
He isn't here.

454
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:32,939
As your new Minister for Magic...

455
00:46:33,142 --> 00:46:38,307
...I promise to restore
this temple of tolerance...

456
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,141
...to its former glory.

457
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:43,381
Therefore, beginning today...

458
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:48,219
...each employee
will submit themselves...

459
00:46:48,891 --> 00:46:51,121
...for evaluation.

460
00:46:51,994 --> 00:46:54,986
You have nothing to fear...

461
00:46:56,432 --> 00:46:58,161
...if you have nothing to hide.

462
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:04,163
- How much?
- Two Galleons.

463
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,831
Come on, time is money. Cheers, pal.

464
00:47:07,009 --> 00:47:08,943
- Snatchers!
- Move out of the way.

465
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:16,617
- I told you.
- Get out.

466
00:47:16,785 --> 00:47:17,809
Squash him.

467
00:47:27,029 --> 00:47:28,656
Be a bit gentler.

468
00:47:54,757 --> 00:47:56,884
They have flesh memories.

469
00:47:59,027 --> 00:48:04,556
When Scrimgeour first gave it to you,
I thought it might open at your touch.

470
00:48:05,401 --> 00:48:08,165
That Dumbledore had hidden
something inside it.

471
00:48:08,404 --> 00:48:10,065
Many of you are wondering...

472
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,174
...why Voldemort has yet to show himself
now that he has vanquished...

473
00:48:13,342 --> 00:48:16,402
...the most powerful symbol of opposition
to him and his followers.

474
00:48:18,447 --> 00:48:19,471
Get off.

475
00:48:19,648 --> 00:48:22,412
Harry Potter, so long it's been.

476
00:48:22,885 --> 00:48:24,216
Get off me.

477
00:48:29,825 --> 00:48:33,761
As requested,
Kreacher has returned with the thief...

478
00:48:33,929 --> 00:48:35,920
- Expelliarmus.
- ...Mundungus Fletcher.

479
00:48:36,098 --> 00:48:39,295
What you playing at? Setting a pair
of bleeding house-elves after me.

480
00:48:39,468 --> 00:48:40,958
Dobby was only trying to help.

481
00:48:41,136 --> 00:48:45,505
Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley,
which Dobby thought was curious.

482
00:48:45,674 --> 00:48:50,008
And then Dobby heard Kreacher
mention Harry Potter's name.

483
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:53,012
- I just--
- And then Dobby saw Kreacher...

484
00:48:53,182 --> 00:48:55,980
- ...talking with the thief, Mundungus--
- I'm no thief.

485
00:48:56,151 --> 00:48:59,086
You foul little-- Git.

486
00:48:59,488 --> 00:49:03,891
I'm a purveyor
of rare and wondrous objects.

487
00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:05,924
You're a thief, Dung. Everyone knows it.

488
00:49:06,094 --> 00:49:09,063
Master Weasley,
so good to see you again.

489
00:49:09,231 --> 00:49:10,255
Wicked trainers.

490
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,764
Listen, I panicked that night, all right?

491
00:49:16,405 --> 00:49:18,635
Could I help it
if Mad-Eye fell off his broom?

492
00:49:20,642 --> 00:49:22,075
- You....
- Tell the truth.

493
00:49:22,244 --> 00:49:25,008
When you turned this place over--
Don't deny it.

494
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,704
--you found a locket, am I right?

495
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:29,146
Why? Was it valuable?

496
00:49:29,318 --> 00:49:30,444
You still got it?

497
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:33,053
No, he's worried
he didn't get enough money for it.

498
00:49:33,222 --> 00:49:34,746
Bleeding give it away, didn't I?

499
00:49:36,124 --> 00:49:39,252
There I was,
flogging me wares in Diagon Alley...

500
00:49:39,428 --> 00:49:43,387
...when some Ministry hag comes up
and asks to see me license.

501
00:49:43,632 --> 00:49:45,691
Says she's a mind to lock me up.

502
00:49:45,868 --> 00:49:49,531
And would've done it too,
if she hadn't taken a fancy to that locket.

503
00:49:49,705 --> 00:49:53,641
- Who was she? The witch. Do you know?
- No, I--

504
00:49:58,447 --> 00:50:01,848
Well, she's there. Look.

505
00:50:03,986 --> 00:50:06,352
Bleeding bow and all.

506
00:50:47,195 --> 00:50:50,961
Right, remember what we said.

507
00:50:51,233 --> 00:50:54,964
Don't speak to anyone
unless absolutely necessary.

508
00:50:55,237 --> 00:51:00,140
Just try and act normal.
Do what everybody else is doing.

509
00:51:00,576 --> 00:51:03,704
If we do that, then with a bit of luck,
we'll get inside.

510
00:51:03,879 --> 00:51:05,471
- And then--
- It gets really tricky.

511
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:07,512
- Correct.
- Yeah.

512
00:51:07,683 --> 00:51:10,584
- This is completely mental.
- Completely.

513
00:51:10,752 --> 00:51:12,777
The world's mental.

514
00:51:12,955 --> 00:51:14,388
Come on...

515
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,424
...we've got a Horcrux to find.

516
00:52:11,313 --> 00:52:13,713
We flush ourselves in.

517
00:52:17,753 --> 00:52:20,517
That's bloody disgusting.

518
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:50,211
Name?

519
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,044
You. Come.

520
00:52:53,221 --> 00:52:55,382
- What? What?
- Come on.

521
00:52:55,557 --> 00:52:57,991
- What did I do?
- Just keep walking.

522
00:53:05,367 --> 00:53:07,301
- Are those--?
- Muggles.

523
00:53:07,469 --> 00:53:12,065
In their rightful place.

524
00:53:13,842 --> 00:53:17,039
Gotta tell you,
I'm starting to freak out a bit.

525
00:53:19,314 --> 00:53:23,808
How long did you say this batch
of Polyjuice would last, Hermione?

526
00:53:24,352 --> 00:53:25,376
I didn't.

527
00:53:32,561 --> 00:53:34,495
Cattermole.

528
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:39,125
It's still raining inside my office.
That's two days now.

529
00:53:41,069 --> 00:53:42,832
Have you tried an umbrella?

530
00:53:43,805 --> 00:53:46,740
You do realize I'm going downstairs,
don't you, Cattermole?

531
00:53:47,309 --> 00:53:51,268
- Downstairs?
- To interrogate your wife.

532
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:56,116
Now, if my wife's blood status
were in doubt...

533
00:53:56,284 --> 00:53:59,185
...and the head of the Department
of Magical Law Enforcement...

534
00:53:59,354 --> 00:54:04,917
...needed a job doing,
I think I might just make that a priority.

535
00:54:05,494 --> 00:54:07,689
You have one hour.

536
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:25,107
Oh, my God. What am I gonna do?
My wife's all alone downstairs.

537
00:54:25,413 --> 00:54:29,679
- Ron, you don't have a wife.
- Oh, right.

538
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:31,819
Level 2.

539
00:54:32,621 --> 00:54:34,748
But how do I stop it raining?

540
00:54:34,923 --> 00:54:37,517
Try "Finite Incantatem."

541
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,557
Department of Magical Law Enforcement...

542
00:54:39,728 --> 00:54:41,161
...and Improper Use of Magic Department.

543
00:54:41,329 --> 00:54:43,297
This is you, Ron.

544
00:54:47,536 --> 00:54:52,371
Finite Incantatem. Okay.
And if that doesn't work...?

545
00:55:04,286 --> 00:55:07,221
Level 1,
Minister of Magic and support staff.

546
00:55:07,389 --> 00:55:09,516
If we don't locate Umbridge
within the hour...

547
00:55:09,691 --> 00:55:11,682
...we go find Ron
and come back another day.

548
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:12,884
- Deal?
- Yes.

549
00:55:16,464 --> 00:55:18,796
Ah, Mafalda. Travers sent you, did he?

550
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:22,027
Good, we'll go straight down.

551
00:55:24,372 --> 00:55:26,897
Albert, aren't you getting out?

552
00:56:00,275 --> 00:56:02,300
Runcorn.

553
00:56:54,796 --> 00:56:56,195
Accio locket.

554
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:54,048
All right, all right.
Let's calm down, shall we?

555
00:57:54,956 --> 00:57:57,424
Let's get back to work, please.

556
00:57:58,226 --> 00:58:00,057
Calm down.

557
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,095
Runcorn.

558
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:16,672
Morning.

559
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:20,814
Ron, it's me.

560
00:58:20,982 --> 00:58:24,816
Harry.
Blimey, forgot what you looked like.

561
00:58:24,986 --> 00:58:26,419
Where's Hermione?

562
00:58:26,588 --> 00:58:30,024
She's gone down to the courtrooms,
with Umbridge.

563
00:58:36,865 --> 00:58:38,992
Bloody cold down here.

564
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:42,762
I'm a half-blood. My father was a wizard.

565
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:45,269
William Alderton.
He worked here for 30 years.

566
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,876
Perhaps you know him.
Always wore his jacket inside out.

567
00:58:49,044 --> 00:58:51,512
No, there's been a mistake.
I'm half-blood, you see.

568
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:54,876
We must go back. I'm half-blood.

569
00:59:04,993 --> 00:59:07,086
- Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?
- Yes.

570
00:59:07,262 --> 00:59:12,199
Of 27 Chislehurst Gardens,
Great Tolling, Evesham?

571
00:59:12,367 --> 00:59:13,391
- Yes.
- It's here.

572
00:59:13,568 --> 00:59:18,369
Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred?
Wife to Reginald?

573
00:59:22,577 --> 00:59:23,635
Reg?

574
00:59:35,223 --> 00:59:37,054
Thank you, Albert.

575
00:59:39,661 --> 00:59:42,391
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?

576
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:45,657
Yes.

577
00:59:46,701 --> 00:59:50,228
A wand was taken from you
upon your arrival at the Ministry today.

578
00:59:50,405 --> 00:59:53,169
Is this that wand?

579
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:59,537
Would you please tell the court from
which witch or wizard you took this wand?

580
00:59:59,714 --> 01:00:02,148
I didn't take it.

581
01:00:03,384 --> 01:00:09,186
I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivander's,
when I was 11.

582
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:13,116
It chose me.

583
01:00:14,496 --> 01:00:16,259
You're lying.

584
01:00:16,698 --> 01:00:21,260
Wands only choose witches,
and you are not a witch.

585
01:00:21,436 --> 01:00:23,461
But I am.

586
01:00:23,905 --> 01:00:26,965
Tell them, Reg. Tell them what I am.

587
01:00:29,511 --> 01:00:30,876
Reg, tell them what I am.

588
01:00:40,855 --> 01:00:42,618
What on earth are you doing, Albert?

589
01:00:45,527 --> 01:00:47,427
You're lying, Dolores.

590
01:00:49,797 --> 01:00:52,357
And one mustn't tell lies.

591
01:00:53,168 --> 01:00:54,465
Stupefy!

592
01:01:02,177 --> 01:01:03,542
It's Harry Potter.

593
01:01:03,711 --> 01:01:06,179
It is, isn't it?
This'll be one to tell the kids.

594
01:01:22,197 --> 01:01:23,357
Expecto Patronum!

595
01:01:47,222 --> 01:01:49,656
Oh. Oh. Oh.

596
01:01:49,824 --> 01:01:51,849
Mary, go home.

597
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:54,761
Get the kids.

598
01:01:54,929 --> 01:01:58,296
I'll meet you there. We have to get out
of the country, understand?

599
01:01:58,466 --> 01:02:00,934
Mary, do as I say.

600
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:16,510
Mary?

601
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:20,052
Who's that?

602
01:02:21,189 --> 01:02:24,181
Long story. Nice meeting you.

603
01:02:24,359 --> 01:02:25,724
It's Harry Potter.

604
01:02:26,427 --> 01:02:28,395
It's Harry. Harry Potter.

605
01:02:28,563 --> 01:02:30,588
- There he is.
- Get him!

606
01:02:30,765 --> 01:02:32,858
- Get him!
- Stop him!

607
01:02:44,779 --> 01:02:45,939
- Watch out.
- Look out.

608
01:02:46,314 --> 01:02:47,713
This way!

609
01:03:06,701 --> 01:03:08,532
Expelliarmus!

610
01:03:55,983 --> 01:03:57,041
Oh, my God.

611
01:03:57,218 --> 01:04:00,847
Shh, shh, shh. It's all right. It's okay.

612
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:06,522
Harry. Harry, quickly, in my bag.

613
01:04:06,694 --> 01:04:09,219
There's a bottle labeled
"Essence of Dittany."

614
01:04:11,799 --> 01:04:14,597
Shh. Shh.

615
01:04:14,769 --> 01:04:17,465
Okay, okay. Quickly.

616
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:20,332
- Accio Dittany.
- Shh.

617
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:23,438
It's all right. Unstopper it.

618
01:04:23,611 --> 01:04:25,101
Hermione, his arm.

619
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:27,270
I know, just do it.

620
01:04:28,015 --> 01:04:29,744
It's okay.

621
01:04:31,018 --> 01:04:34,977
- Okay, it's gonna sting a little bit.
- What happened? I thought we meant...

622
01:04:35,156 --> 01:04:37,886
- ...to be going back to Grimmauld Place.
- We were. We were. Shh.

623
01:04:38,059 --> 01:04:39,890
It's all right. One more, one more.

624
01:04:40,061 --> 01:04:44,589
We were there, we were there,
but Yaxley had hold of me, and I....

625
01:04:44,766 --> 01:04:47,792
I knew once he'd seen where we were,
we couldn't stay...

626
01:04:47,969 --> 01:04:51,097
...so I brought us here...

627
01:04:51,572 --> 01:04:54,200
...but Ron got splinched.

628
01:04:57,278 --> 01:04:59,075
It's all right.

629
01:05:18,132 --> 01:05:20,498
Protego Totalum.

630
01:05:21,969 --> 01:05:23,436
Salvio Hexia.

631
01:05:23,604 --> 01:05:25,003
What are you doing?

632
01:05:25,173 --> 01:05:27,471
Protective enchantments.

633
01:05:27,642 --> 01:05:31,237
I don't fancy another visit like the one
we had in Shaftesbury Avenue, do you?

634
01:05:31,412 --> 01:05:33,107
You can get going on the tent.

635
01:05:33,781 --> 01:05:35,612
- Tent?
- Protego Totalum.

636
01:05:35,783 --> 01:05:37,910
Where am I supposed to find a tent?

637
01:05:38,085 --> 01:05:42,385
Repello Muggletum. Muffliato.

638
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,600
You first.

639
01:05:57,605 --> 01:05:59,698
Dissendium.

640
01:06:13,321 --> 01:06:15,221
Incendio.

641
01:06:20,628 --> 01:06:22,653
Expulso.

642
01:06:29,871 --> 01:06:31,998
Diffindo.

643
01:06:33,441 --> 01:06:34,465
Reducto.

644
01:06:55,897 --> 01:06:57,762
What are you doing?

645
01:06:59,166 --> 01:07:01,930
We have to keep it safe
until we find out how to destroy it.

646
01:07:02,103 --> 01:07:04,799
Seems strange, mate.
Dumbledore sends you off...

647
01:07:04,972 --> 01:07:08,738
...to find all these Horcruxes,
but doesn't tell you how to destroy them.

648
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:10,537
Doesn't that bother you?

649
01:07:22,924 --> 01:07:26,325
A goblin by the name of Gornuk was killed.

650
01:07:26,494 --> 01:07:29,554
It is believed that Muggle-born
Dean Thomas and a second goblin...

651
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:32,665
...both believed to have been traveling
with Tonks, Cresswell...

652
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:34,357
...and Gornuk, may have escaped.

653
01:07:34,535 --> 01:07:38,301
If Dean is listening or anyone has
any knowledge of his whereabouts...

654
01:07:38,472 --> 01:07:41,532
...his parents and sisters
are desperate for news.

655
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:45,076
Meanwhile, a Muggle family of five
has been found dead in their home.

656
01:07:45,246 --> 01:07:48,511
You know the spell, Harry.

657
01:07:52,253 --> 01:07:53,515
Tell me.

658
01:07:56,157 --> 01:07:57,988
Tell me, Gregorovitch.

659
01:07:58,159 --> 01:07:59,786
It was stolen from me.

660
01:07:59,961 --> 01:08:03,419
Who was he? The thief?

661
01:08:06,567 --> 01:08:10,526
It was a boy. It was he who took it.

662
01:08:10,905 --> 01:08:13,203
I never saw it again.

663
01:08:13,374 --> 01:08:15,171
I swear on my life.

664
01:08:16,043 --> 01:08:17,203
I believe you.

665
01:08:23,217 --> 01:08:24,946
Avada Kedavra!

666
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,090
I thought it had stopped.

667
01:08:43,004 --> 01:08:45,438
You can't keep letting him in, Harry.

668
01:08:47,508 --> 01:08:50,443
You-Know-Who has found Gregorovitch.

669
01:08:50,745 --> 01:08:52,303
The wandmaker?

670
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:57,008
He wants something
that Gregorovitch used to have...

671
01:08:57,184 --> 01:08:58,651
...but I don't know what.

672
01:08:58,819 --> 01:09:04,815
But he wants it desperately.
I mean, it's as if his life depends on it.

673
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,884
Don't.

674
01:09:08,062 --> 01:09:10,257
- It comforts him.
- It sets my teeth on edge.

675
01:09:10,431 --> 01:09:12,661
What's he expecting to hear,
good news?

676
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:15,700
--who long expected it,
the fall of the Ministry was shocking.

677
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:18,236
I think he just hopes
he doesn't hear bad news.

678
01:09:18,406 --> 01:09:20,340
We promise
to remain your eyes and ears--

679
01:09:20,508 --> 01:09:21,941
How long before he can travel?

680
01:09:22,109 --> 01:09:25,306
--bringing you news when we can,
from wherever we can.

681
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:26,776
I'm doing everything I can.

682
01:09:26,947 --> 01:09:28,471
You're not doing enough!

683
01:09:31,218 --> 01:09:33,243
Take it off.

684
01:09:34,021 --> 01:09:36,581
I said, take it off now.

685
01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:50,331
- Better?
- Loads.

686
01:09:54,041 --> 01:09:56,305
We'll take it in turns, okay?

687
01:10:25,372 --> 01:10:28,739
Finch does admit
his invention currently has one short.

688
01:10:28,909 --> 01:10:30,376
And now, other news:

689
01:10:30,544 --> 01:10:33,809
Severus Snape, newly-appointed
headmaster of Hogwarts...

690
01:10:33,981 --> 01:10:37,747
...has decreed that all students
must conform to the latest house rules.

691
01:11:05,379 --> 01:11:09,816
Hogwarts bears little resemblance to the
school under Dumbledore's leadership.

692
01:11:09,984 --> 01:11:13,613
Snape's curriculum is severe,
reflecting the wishes of the Dark Lord...

693
01:11:14,455 --> 01:11:19,392
...and infractions are dealt with harshly
by the two Death Eaters on staff.

694
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:40,210
What's that?

695
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:52,254
What's that smell?

696
01:12:14,715 --> 01:12:16,740
- What you doing?
- It's heavy.

697
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:18,509
Oh, sorry. Do you want me to carry it?

698
01:12:18,686 --> 01:12:21,621
- Yeah, thank you.
- Don't be ridiculous. Pick it up.

699
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,214
Numpty.

700
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:31,321
Snatchers.

701
01:12:32,366 --> 01:12:34,800
Good to know your enchantments work.

702
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,469
He could smell it. My perfume.

703
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:47,738
I've told you...

704
01:12:48,215 --> 01:12:50,046
...Ron isn't strong enough to Apparate.

705
01:12:50,217 --> 01:12:53,948
Well, then, we'll go on foot.

706
01:12:54,755 --> 01:12:59,692
And next time, Hermione, as much as
I like your perfume, just don't wear any.

707
01:13:04,598 --> 01:13:08,466
And now for the names
of missing witches and wizards.

708
01:13:09,336 --> 01:13:11,497
These are confirmed.

709
01:13:12,339 --> 01:13:15,706
Thankfully, the list is short today.

710
01:13:16,443 --> 01:13:18,502
Jason and Alison Denbright.

711
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:20,404
Oh. Thank you.

712
01:13:20,581 --> 01:13:24,312
Bella, Jake, Charlie, and Madge Farley.

713
01:13:24,652 --> 01:13:25,676
Joe Laurie.

714
01:13:26,987 --> 01:13:29,581
Eleanor Sarah Gibbs.

715
01:13:30,758 --> 01:13:34,057
Harry and Bronwyn Trigg.

716
01:13:35,696 --> 01:13:38,722
Rob and Ellie Dowson.

717
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:42,358
Georgia Clark-Day.

718
01:13:42,937 --> 01:13:45,462
Joshua Flexson.

719
01:13:45,873 --> 01:13:47,363
George Coutas.

720
01:13:48,509 --> 01:13:51,342
Gabriella and Emily Mather.

721
01:13:52,379 --> 01:13:55,473
Jacob and Mimi Erland.

722
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:58,040
William and Brian Gallagher.

723
01:13:58,218 --> 01:14:00,652
He doesn't know
what he's doing, does he?

724
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:05,390
None of us do.

725
01:14:07,962 --> 01:14:10,726
Toby and Olivia Gleaves.

726
01:14:11,598 --> 01:14:14,226
Katie and James Killick.

727
01:14:14,401 --> 01:14:16,926
Elsie Valentine Schroeder.

728
01:14:17,972 --> 01:14:20,065
Jennifer Winston.

729
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:23,334
Tamsin and lola Hillicker.

730
01:14:24,545 --> 01:14:25,569
Scarlet and Kitty Sharp.

731
01:14:44,618 --> 01:14:46,449
Oh, my God.

732
01:14:46,821 --> 01:14:48,448
What?

733
01:14:49,023 --> 01:14:51,048
I'll tell you in a minute.

734
01:14:51,592 --> 01:14:54,288
Maybe you could tell me now.

735
01:14:54,662 --> 01:14:57,688
The sword of Gryffindor,
it's goblin-made.

736
01:14:57,865 --> 01:14:58,957
Brilliant.

737
01:15:00,034 --> 01:15:02,434
No, you don't understand.

738
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:05,136
Dirt and rust have no effect
on the blade.

739
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:09,507
It only takes in
that which makes it stronger.

740
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:11,275
Okay.

741
01:15:11,445 --> 01:15:14,937
Harry, you've already destroyed
one Horcrux, right?

742
01:15:15,116 --> 01:15:17,380
Tom Riddle's diary
in the Chamber of Secrets.

743
01:15:17,551 --> 01:15:20,452
With a Basilisk fang.
If you tell me you've got one of those...

744
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:24,079
- ...in that bloody beaded bag of yours....
- Don't you see?

745
01:15:24,258 --> 01:15:27,989
In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed
the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor.

746
01:15:28,162 --> 01:15:31,689
Its blade is impregnated
with Basilisk venom.

747
01:15:31,866 --> 01:15:33,959
It only takes in
that which makes it stronger.

748
01:15:34,135 --> 01:15:37,298
- Exactly, which is why--
- It can destroy Horcruxes.

749
01:15:37,471 --> 01:15:39,735
That's why Dumbledore left it to you
in his will.

750
01:15:39,907 --> 01:15:44,310
You are brilliant, Hermione. Truly.

751
01:15:44,478 --> 01:15:48,539
Actually, I'm highly logical, which
allows me to look past extraneous detail...

752
01:15:48,716 --> 01:15:51,207
...and perceive clearly
that which others overlook.

753
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:54,081
Yeah, there's only one problem,
of course.

754
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,587
The sword was stolen.

755
01:16:02,997 --> 01:16:05,522
Yeah, I'm still here.

756
01:16:06,033 --> 01:16:10,163
But you two carry on.
Don't let me spoil the fun.

757
01:16:11,539 --> 01:16:15,532
- What's wrong?
- Wrong? Nothing's wrong.

758
01:16:15,709 --> 01:16:17,609
Not according to you, anyway.

759
01:16:17,778 --> 01:16:21,407
Look, if you've got something to say,
don't be shy. Spit it out.

760
01:16:21,782 --> 01:16:25,081
All right, I'll spit it out.
But don't expect me to be grateful...

761
01:16:25,252 --> 01:16:27,777
...because there's another damn thing
we've gotta find.

762
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:30,219
I thought you knew
what you signed up for.

763
01:16:30,724 --> 01:16:32,589
Yeah. I thought I did too.

764
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,786
Well then, I'm sorry,
but I don't quite understand.

765
01:16:35,963 --> 01:16:39,421
What part of this isn't living up
to your expectations?

766
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,864
Did you think we were gonna
be staying in a hotel?

767
01:16:42,036 --> 01:16:45,301
Finding a Horcrux every other day?
Thought you'd be back by Christmas?

768
01:16:45,472 --> 01:16:47,303
I just thought, after all this time...

769
01:16:47,474 --> 01:16:50,910
...we would've achieved something.
I thought you knew what you were doing.

770
01:16:51,078 --> 01:16:53,478
I thought Dumbledore told you
something worthwhile.

771
01:16:53,647 --> 01:16:56,844
- I thought you had a plan.
- I told you everything Dumbledore told me.

772
01:16:57,017 --> 01:16:59,212
In case you haven't noticed,
we found a Horcrux.

773
01:16:59,386 --> 01:17:03,254
Yeah, and we're as close to getting rid of it
as we are to finding the rest of them.

774
01:17:03,424 --> 01:17:06,018
Ron. Please, take--

775
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,960
Take the Horcrux off.
You wouldn't be saying this...

776
01:17:09,129 --> 01:17:10,460
...if you hadn't been wearing it all day.

777
01:17:10,631 --> 01:17:13,031
Want to know why I listen to that radio?

778
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:17,864
To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name,
or Fred, or George or Mom.

779
01:17:18,038 --> 01:17:21,201
You think I'm not listening?
You think I don't know how this feels?!

780
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:22,842
No, you don't know how it feels!

781
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:25,376
Your parents are dead.
You have no family.

782
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,210
- Stop. Stop.
- Fine, then go!

783
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:31,210
Go, then!

784
01:17:34,121 --> 01:17:35,145
Fine.

785
01:17:38,292 --> 01:17:39,953
Ron.

786
01:17:43,197 --> 01:17:44,994
And you?

787
01:17:46,734 --> 01:17:49,259
Are you coming or you staying?

788
01:17:56,377 --> 01:17:59,437
Fine. I get it.

789
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,048
I saw you two the other night.

790
01:18:02,449 --> 01:18:04,883
Ron, that's-- That's nothing.

791
01:18:07,021 --> 01:18:08,386
Ron--

792
01:18:11,592 --> 01:18:13,924
Ron, where are you going?

793
01:18:14,928 --> 01:18:17,158
Please, come back.

794
01:18:18,632 --> 01:18:20,327
Ron.

795
01:18:25,039 --> 01:18:26,063
Ron!

796
01:19:28,369 --> 01:19:30,997
Salvio Hexia.

797
01:19:34,475 --> 01:19:36,909
Repellum Muggletum.

798
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:42,414
Salvio Hexia.

799
01:20:03,737 --> 01:20:06,399
Poor old Jim's white as a ghost

800
01:20:07,207 --> 01:20:10,404
He's found the answer that we lost

801
01:20:10,811 --> 01:20:14,247
We're all weeping now
Weeping because

802
01:20:14,815 --> 01:20:20,378
There ain't nothing we can do
To protect you

803
01:20:20,754 --> 01:20:24,246
O children

804
01:20:28,195 --> 01:20:31,926
Lift up your voice

805
01:20:32,099 --> 01:20:37,594
Lift up your voice

806
01:20:37,771 --> 01:20:40,001
Children

807
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:49,444
Rejoice, rejoice

808
01:20:49,616 --> 01:20:53,017
Hey, little train, we're jumping on

809
01:20:53,187 --> 01:20:56,918
The train that goes to the kingdom

810
01:20:57,458 --> 01:21:00,621
We're happy, Ma
We're having fun

811
01:21:00,794 --> 01:21:04,924
And the train ain't even left the station

812
01:21:05,098 --> 01:21:08,465
Hey, little train, wait for me

813
01:21:08,669 --> 01:21:12,503
I once was blind but now I see

814
01:21:12,673 --> 01:21:16,006
Have you left a seat for me?

815
01:21:16,176 --> 01:21:20,306
Is that such a stretch of the imagination?

816
01:21:20,481 --> 01:21:23,814
Hey, little train, wait for me

817
01:21:23,984 --> 01:21:27,852
I was held in chains but now I'm free

818
01:21:28,155 --> 01:21:31,056
I'm hanging in there
Don't you see?

819
01:21:31,225 --> 01:21:35,685
In this process of elimination

820
01:21:35,863 --> 01:21:38,991
Hey, little train, we're jumping on

821
01:21:39,233 --> 01:21:42,691
The train that goes to the kingdom

822
01:21:43,303 --> 01:21:46,602
We're happy, Ma
We're having fun

823
01:21:46,773 --> 01:21:50,675
It's beyond my wildest expectation

824
01:21:50,844 --> 01:21:54,075
Hey, little train, we're jumping on

825
01:21:54,248 --> 01:21:57,877
The train that goes to the kingdom

826
01:21:58,418 --> 01:22:01,615
We're happy, Ma
We're having fun

827
01:22:01,788 --> 01:22:06,657
The train ain't even left the station

828
01:22:53,373 --> 01:22:54,863
Hermione.

829
01:22:55,042 --> 01:22:57,374
Hermione? You were right.

830
01:22:57,544 --> 01:22:59,102
Snitches have flesh memories...

831
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:03,909
...but I didn't catch the first Snitch
with my hand, I almost swallowed it.

832
01:23:09,189 --> 01:23:11,953
- "I open at the close."
- What do you think that means?

833
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:13,524
I don't know.

834
01:23:15,929 --> 01:23:18,329
I found something as well.

835
01:23:24,705 --> 01:23:28,163
At first I thought it was an eye,
but now I don't think it is.

836
01:23:28,342 --> 01:23:32,506
It isn't a rune, and it isn't anywhere
in Spellman's Syllabary.

837
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:36,074
Somebody inked it in.
It isn't part of the book. Somebody drew it.

838
01:23:36,249 --> 01:23:39,912
Luna's dad was wearing that
at Bill and Fleur's wedding.

839
01:23:42,656 --> 01:23:45,955
Why would someone draw it
in a children's book?

840
01:23:48,562 --> 01:23:50,996
Look, Hermione, I've been thinking.

841
01:23:51,565 --> 01:23:53,658
I want to go to Godric's Hollow.

842
01:23:53,834 --> 01:23:56,894
It's where I was born.
It's where my parents died.

843
01:23:57,070 --> 01:24:00,665
That's exactly where he'll expect you to go
because it means something to you.

844
01:24:00,841 --> 01:24:03,275
Yeah, but it means something to him too,
Hermione.

845
01:24:03,443 --> 01:24:05,434
You-Know-Who almost died there.

846
01:24:05,612 --> 01:24:10,276
I mean, isn't that exactly the type of place
he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux?

847
01:24:11,251 --> 01:24:13,811
It's dangerous, Harry.

848
01:24:15,422 --> 01:24:19,415
But even I have to admit, recently
I've been thinking we'll have to go there.

849
01:24:19,593 --> 01:24:22,027
I think it's possible
something else is hidden there.

850
01:24:22,195 --> 01:24:23,719
What?

851
01:24:24,431 --> 01:24:26,126
The sword.

852
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:30,500
If Dumbledore wanted you to find it,
but didn't want it in the Ministry's hands...

853
01:24:30,671 --> 01:24:34,869
...where better to hide it than
the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor?

854
01:24:36,209 --> 01:24:38,074
Hermione....

855
01:24:43,316 --> 01:24:46,046
Don't ever let me
give you a haircut again.

856
01:25:07,307 --> 01:25:09,969
I still think we should've used
Polyjuice Potion.

857
01:25:10,143 --> 01:25:11,667
No.

858
01:25:12,345 --> 01:25:14,540
This is where I was born.

859
01:25:14,881 --> 01:25:17,281
I'm not returning as someone else.

860
01:25:27,094 --> 01:25:30,086
Good night. Ha-ha-ha.

861
01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:35,897
Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve.

862
01:25:37,404 --> 01:25:38,701
Listen.

863
01:25:44,411 --> 01:25:47,244
Do you think they'd be in there,
Hermione?

864
01:25:47,681 --> 01:25:49,672
My mom and dad.

865
01:25:55,622 --> 01:25:57,886
Yeah, I think they would.

866
01:26:34,461 --> 01:26:37,521
"Ignotus Peverell."

867
01:26:39,599 --> 01:26:41,226
Hey, Harry?

868
01:27:19,105 --> 01:27:21,300
Merry Christmas, Hermione.

869
01:27:22,609 --> 01:27:24,839
Merry Christmas, Harry.

870
01:27:44,698 --> 01:27:50,102
Harry, there's someone
watching us. By the church.

871
01:28:00,814 --> 01:28:02,645
I think I know who that is.

872
01:28:04,517 --> 01:28:05,950
I don't like this, Harry.

873
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:11,147
Hermione, she knew
Dumbledore. She might have the sword.

874
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:31,637
This is where they died, Hermione.

875
01:28:39,219 --> 01:28:41,687
This is where he murdered them.

876
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,134
You're Bathilda, aren't you?

877
01:29:01,741 --> 01:29:03,834
Here, let me do that.

878
01:29:27,968 --> 01:29:31,870
Miss Bagshot, who is this man?

879
01:29:43,483 --> 01:29:45,144
Harry.

880
01:29:49,189 --> 01:29:51,054
Lumos.

881
01:31:31,424 --> 01:31:32,448
Harry!

882
01:32:23,276 --> 01:32:24,334
Confringo!

883
01:33:07,086 --> 01:33:09,213
Are you feeling better?

884
01:33:12,292 --> 01:33:14,760
You've outdone yourself this time,
Hermione.

885
01:33:14,928 --> 01:33:17,021
The Forest of Dean.

886
01:33:17,997 --> 01:33:22,366
I came here once with Mom and Dad,
years ago.

887
01:33:23,002 --> 01:33:25,129
It's just how I remember it.

888
01:33:25,538 --> 01:33:29,474
The trees, the river, everything.

889
01:33:29,776 --> 01:33:32,609
Like nothing's changed.

890
01:33:33,846 --> 01:33:36,838
Not true, of course.
Everything's changed.

891
01:33:37,817 --> 01:33:41,617
If I brought my parents back here now,
they probably wouldn't recognize any of it.

892
01:33:43,723 --> 01:33:47,853
Not the trees, not the river...

893
01:33:49,629 --> 01:33:51,756
...not even me.

894
01:33:56,903 --> 01:33:59,701
Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.

895
01:34:01,708 --> 01:34:03,835
Grow old.

896
01:34:09,849 --> 01:34:13,148
You wanted to know
who the boy in the photograph was.

897
01:34:13,886 --> 01:34:14,978
I know.

898
01:34:16,155 --> 01:34:18,555
Gellert Grindelwald.

899
01:34:25,498 --> 01:34:28,899
He's the thief I saw
in Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.

900
01:34:29,068 --> 01:34:32,333
Speaking of which, where is my wand?

901
01:34:33,673 --> 01:34:36,073
Where's my wand, Hermione?

902
01:34:44,717 --> 01:34:49,211
As we were leaving Godric's Hollow,
I cast a curse and it rebounded.

903
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:53,186
I'm sorry.

904
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:56,488
- I tried to mend it, but wands are different.
- It's done.

905
01:34:58,464 --> 01:35:02,423
Leave me yours.
Go inside and get warm.

906
01:35:02,835 --> 01:35:05,167
I'll take the locket as well.

907
01:35:17,717 --> 01:35:19,082
Trust me.

908
01:36:44,837 --> 01:36:46,464
Lumos.

909
01:37:27,547 --> 01:37:28,912
Accio sword.

910
01:37:34,754 --> 01:37:36,654
Diffindo.

911
01:39:17,089 --> 01:39:20,252
- Hermione?
- Are you mental?

912
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:23,018
It was you?

913
01:39:23,195 --> 01:39:26,961
Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I think.

914
01:39:27,133 --> 01:39:28,930
And you cast the doe as well, did you?

915
01:39:29,502 --> 01:39:33,165
- No, I thought that was you.
- No, my Patronus is a stag.

916
01:39:33,339 --> 01:39:35,534
Right. Yeah. Antlers.

917
01:39:38,711 --> 01:39:41,874
Okay, Ron. Do it.

918
01:39:42,848 --> 01:39:46,579
I can't handle it. That thing affects me
more than it affects you and Hermione.

919
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:49,747
- All the more reason.
- No. I can't.

920
01:39:49,922 --> 01:39:51,150
Then why are you here?

921
01:39:52,558 --> 01:39:54,617
Why did you come back?

922
01:40:02,201 --> 01:40:06,331
Now, I'll have to speak to it in order for it
to open. When it does, don't hesitate.

923
01:40:06,939 --> 01:40:09,464
I don't know what's in there,
but it'll put up a fight.

924
01:40:09,642 --> 01:40:12,338
The bit of Riddle that was in that diary
tried to kill me.

925
01:40:14,814 --> 01:40:16,441
All right.

926
01:40:17,283 --> 01:40:18,841
One...

927
01:40:19,518 --> 01:40:20,576
...two...

928
01:40:21,253 --> 01:40:23,153
...three.

929
01:40:33,399 --> 01:40:38,496
I have seen your heart, and it is mine.

930
01:40:41,107 --> 01:40:45,009
I have seen your dreams,
Ronald Weasley...

931
01:40:45,177 --> 01:40:47,577
...and I have seen your fears.

932
01:40:49,281 --> 01:40:53,445
Least loved by your mother,
who craved a daughter.

933
01:40:54,086 --> 01:40:59,080
Least loved by the girl
who prefers your friend.

934
01:40:59,258 --> 01:41:01,988
Ron, kill it!

935
01:41:08,434 --> 01:41:11,130
We were better without you.

936
01:41:11,637 --> 01:41:13,366
Happier without you.

937
01:41:13,539 --> 01:41:18,909
Who could look at you
compared to Harry Potter?

938
01:41:20,146 --> 01:41:23,479
What are you
compared with the Chosen One?

939
01:41:23,649 --> 01:41:24,809
Ron, it's lying!

940
01:41:24,984 --> 01:41:27,976
Your mother confessed
she would have preferred me as a son.

941
01:41:28,154 --> 01:41:31,146
What woman would take you?

942
01:41:31,357 --> 01:41:34,520
You are nothing.

943
01:41:34,694 --> 01:41:35,820
Nothing.

944
01:41:36,595 --> 01:41:40,622
Nothing compared to him.

945
01:42:31,183 --> 01:42:32,844
Just think...

946
01:42:33,753 --> 01:42:35,846
...only three to go.

947
01:42:38,891 --> 01:42:40,620
Hermione?

948
01:42:42,895 --> 01:42:44,624
Hermione?

949
01:42:49,168 --> 01:42:51,102
Is everything all right?

950
01:42:51,737 --> 01:42:56,401
It's fine.
Actually, you know, it's more than fine.

951
01:43:00,846 --> 01:43:02,438
Hey.

952
01:43:06,685 --> 01:43:12,885
You complete ass, Ronald Weasley!

953
01:43:13,058 --> 01:43:16,721
You show up here after weeks,
and you say "hey"?

954
01:43:18,931 --> 01:43:21,661
- Where's my wand? Where's my wand?
- I don't know.

955
01:43:21,834 --> 01:43:24,098
- Harry Potter, give me my wand.
- I don't have it.

956
01:43:24,270 --> 01:43:28,104
- How come he's got your wand?
- Never mind why he's got my wand.

957
01:43:30,376 --> 01:43:31,604
What is that?

958
01:43:34,547 --> 01:43:35,571
You destroyed it.

959
01:43:38,884 --> 01:43:42,843
And how is it that you just happen
to have the sword of Gryffindor?

960
01:43:43,255 --> 01:43:45,223
It's a long story.

961
01:43:48,394 --> 01:43:52,490
- Don't think this changes anything.
- Oh, of course not.

962
01:43:52,665 --> 01:43:55,930
I only just destroyed a bloody Horcrux.
Why would that change anything?

963
01:43:56,101 --> 01:44:00,162
Look, I wanted to come back
as soon as I left.

964
01:44:00,339 --> 01:44:03,775
- I just didn't know how to find you.
- Yeah, how did you find us?

965
01:44:03,943 --> 01:44:07,003
With this. It doesn't just turn off lights.

966
01:44:07,179 --> 01:44:12,082
I don't know how it works, but Christmas
morning I was sleeping in this little pub...

967
01:44:12,251 --> 01:44:14,685
...keeping away from some Snatchers...

968
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:16,382
...and I heard it.

969
01:44:16,789 --> 01:44:18,222
It?

970
01:44:19,558 --> 01:44:21,492
A voice...

971
01:44:23,095 --> 01:44:24,289
...your voice, Hermione...

972
01:44:25,464 --> 01:44:27,091
...coming out of it.

973
01:44:27,266 --> 01:44:31,100
- And what exactly did I say, may I ask?
- My name.

974
01:44:31,704 --> 01:44:33,729
Just my name.

975
01:44:34,506 --> 01:44:36,599
Like a whisper.

976
01:44:38,577 --> 01:44:44,573
So I took it, clicked it,
and this tiny ball of light appeared.

977
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:46,483
And I knew.

978
01:44:47,052 --> 01:44:51,682
And sure enough, it floated toward me,
the ball of light...

979
01:44:53,392 --> 01:44:57,590
...went right to my chest,
straight through me. Right here.

980
01:44:58,797 --> 01:45:02,790
And I knew it was gonna take me
where I needed to go, so I Disapparated...

981
01:45:02,968 --> 01:45:05,232
...and came to this hillside.

982
01:45:05,771 --> 01:45:08,296
It was dark. I had no idea where I was.

983
01:45:08,841 --> 01:45:11,674
I just hoped
that one of you would show yourself.

984
01:45:12,578 --> 01:45:14,102
And you did.

985
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:34,431
I've always liked these flames
Hermione makes.

986
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:41,030
How long do you reckon
she'll stay mad at me?

987
01:45:42,574 --> 01:45:45,907
Well, just keep talking about that
little ball of light touching your heart...

988
01:45:46,078 --> 01:45:47,511
...and she'll come round.

989
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:50,410
It was true. Every word.

990
01:45:52,217 --> 01:45:54,583
This is gonna sound crazy...

991
01:45:55,054 --> 01:45:59,423
...but I think that's why Dumbledore
left it to me, the Deluminator.

992
01:45:59,925 --> 01:46:04,919
I think he knew that somehow I'd need it
to find my way back, and she'd lead me.

993
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:10,530
Bloody hell, I just realized,
you need a wand, don't you?

994
01:46:10,703 --> 01:46:13,194
- Yeah.
- I've got one here.

995
01:46:13,472 --> 01:46:16,066
It's a blackthorn. Ten inches.

996
01:46:16,241 --> 01:46:19,836
Nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.

997
01:46:20,279 --> 01:46:23,077
Took if off a Snatcher
a couple of weeks ago.

998
01:46:23,582 --> 01:46:27,416
Don't tell Hermione this,
but they're a bit dim, Snatchers.

999
01:46:27,686 --> 01:46:30,621
This one was definitely part troll,
the smell of him.

1000
01:46:30,789 --> 01:46:31,813
Engorgio.

1001
01:46:31,991 --> 01:46:34,152
- Reducio!
- What's going on in there?

1002
01:46:34,326 --> 01:46:35,588
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

1003
01:46:37,963 --> 01:46:39,590
We need to talk.

1004
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:41,593
Yeah, all right.

1005
01:46:48,574 --> 01:46:52,101
- I want to go see Xenophilius Lovegood.
- Sorry?

1006
01:46:53,879 --> 01:46:55,506
See this?

1007
01:46:55,681 --> 01:46:59,549
It's a letter Dumbledore wrote
to Grindelwald. Look at the signature.

1008
01:47:00,786 --> 01:47:02,981
It's the mark again.

1009
01:47:03,922 --> 01:47:06,049
It keeps cropping up.

1010
01:47:06,225 --> 01:47:10,594
In Beedle the Bard,
in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow.

1011
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:13,295
It was there too.

1012
01:47:13,465 --> 01:47:17,060
- Where?
- Outside Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.

1013
01:47:17,503 --> 01:47:18,731
But what does it mean?

1014
01:47:18,904 --> 01:47:23,705
Look, you've got no idea where
the next Horcrux is, and neither do I...

1015
01:47:25,411 --> 01:47:28,346
...but this, this means something.

1016
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:32,081
- I'm sure of it.
- Yeah. Hermione's right.

1017
01:47:33,118 --> 01:47:35,211
We ought to see Lovegood.

1018
01:47:35,721 --> 01:47:39,452
Let's vote on it. Those in favor?

1019
01:48:03,282 --> 01:48:05,910
You're not still mad at him, are you?

1020
01:48:06,218 --> 01:48:08,482
I'm always mad at him.

1021
01:48:11,256 --> 01:48:12,746
Luna.

1022
01:48:12,925 --> 01:48:14,620
Luna.

1023
01:48:22,301 --> 01:48:25,134
"Keep off the dirigible plums."

1024
01:48:34,179 --> 01:48:36,875
What is it? Who are you?

1025
01:48:37,182 --> 01:48:38,206
What do you want?

1026
01:48:38,383 --> 01:48:42,979
Hello, Mr. Lovegood. I'm Harry Potter.
We met a few months ago.

1027
01:48:46,992 --> 01:48:48,892
Could we come in?

1028
01:48:52,664 --> 01:48:55,258
- Where is Luna?
- Luna?

1029
01:48:56,535 --> 01:48:58,503
She'll be along.

1030
01:49:12,017 --> 01:49:14,076
So how can I help you, Mr. Potter?

1031
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:17,946
Well, actually....

1032
01:49:18,957 --> 01:49:23,485
It was about something you were wearing
round your neck at the wedding. A symbol.

1033
01:49:25,030 --> 01:49:26,930
You mean this?

1034
01:49:27,332 --> 01:49:28,924
Yes.

1035
01:49:29,234 --> 01:49:31,099
That exactly.

1036
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:35,729
What we've wondered is, what is it?

1037
01:49:35,908 --> 01:49:37,739
What is it?

1038
01:49:37,910 --> 01:49:40,879
Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows,
of course.

1039
01:49:41,046 --> 01:49:42,138
- The what?
- The what?

1040
01:49:42,314 --> 01:49:44,373
The Deathly Hallows.

1041
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:47,644
I assume you're all familiar with
"The Tale of the Three Brothers."

1042
01:49:47,819 --> 01:49:49,309
- Yes.
- No.

1043
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:56,423
I have it in here.

1044
01:50:07,673 --> 01:50:09,300
"There were once three brothers...

1045
01:50:09,474 --> 01:50:13,877
...who were traveling along a lonely,
winding road at twilight."

1046
01:50:14,046 --> 01:50:16,776
Midnight. Mom always said "midnight."

1047
01:50:21,787 --> 01:50:25,655
But "twilight's" fine. Better, actually.

1048
01:50:27,926 --> 01:50:29,791
Do you want to read it?

1049
01:50:29,962 --> 01:50:32,157
No. It's fine.

1050
01:50:34,066 --> 01:50:36,000
"There were once three brothers...

1051
01:50:36,168 --> 01:50:41,367
...who were traveling along a lonely,
winding road at twilight.

1052
01:50:43,242 --> 01:50:48,544
In time, the brothers reached a river
too treacherous to pass.

1053
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,745
But being learned in the magical arts...

1054
01:50:50,916 --> 01:50:56,081
...the three brothers simply
waved their wands and made a bridge.

1055
01:50:57,422 --> 01:50:59,515
Before they could cross, however...

1056
01:50:59,691 --> 01:51:03,787
...they found their path blocked
by a hooded figure.

1057
01:51:04,062 --> 01:51:07,930
It was Death, and he felt cheated.

1058
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:11,160
Cheated because travelers would
normally drown in the river.

1059
01:51:11,336 --> 01:51:13,395
But Death was cunning.

1060
01:51:14,039 --> 01:51:17,031
He pretended to congratulate
the three brothers on their magic...

1061
01:51:17,209 --> 01:51:22,476
...and said that each had earned a prize for
having been clever enough to evade him.

1062
01:51:23,048 --> 01:51:27,610
The oldest asked for a wand
more powerful than any in existence.

1063
01:51:27,786 --> 01:51:32,382
So Death fashioned him one
from an elder tree that stood nearby.

1064
01:51:33,792 --> 01:51:38,092
The second brother decided he wanted
to humiliate Death even further...

1065
01:51:38,263 --> 01:51:42,700
...and asked for the power
to recall loved ones from the grave.

1066
01:51:43,135 --> 01:51:47,435
So Death plucked a stone from the river
and offered it to him.

1067
01:51:48,173 --> 01:51:52,132
Finally,
Death turned to the third brother.

1068
01:51:53,345 --> 01:51:54,778
A humble man...

1069
01:51:54,946 --> 01:51:59,144
...he asked for something that would
allow him to go forth from that place...

1070
01:51:59,318 --> 01:52:02,481
...without being followed by Death.

1071
01:52:03,588 --> 01:52:09,458
And so it was that Death reluctantly
handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.

1072
01:52:12,831 --> 01:52:15,766
The first brother traveled
to a distant village...

1073
01:52:15,934 --> 01:52:18,027
...where, with the Elder Wand in hand...

1074
01:52:18,203 --> 01:52:21,969
...he killed a wizard
with whom he had once quarreled.

1075
01:52:24,176 --> 01:52:27,703
Drunk with the power
that the Elder Wand had given him...

1076
01:52:27,879 --> 01:52:30,973
...he bragged of his invincibility.

1077
01:52:33,985 --> 01:52:37,443
But that night,
another wizard stole the wand...

1078
01:52:37,622 --> 01:52:40,750
...and slit the brother's throat
for good measure.

1079
01:52:40,959 --> 01:52:44,395
And so Death took the first brother
for his own.

1080
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:47,098
The second brother journeyed
to his home...

1081
01:52:47,265 --> 01:52:50,234
...where he took the stone
and turned it thrice in hand.

1082
01:52:50,402 --> 01:52:54,862
To his delight, the girl he'd once hoped
to marry before her untimely death...

1083
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,406
...appeared before him.

1084
01:52:57,909 --> 01:53:03,211
Yet, soon she turned sad and cold
for she did not belong in the mortal world.

1085
01:53:03,382 --> 01:53:05,009
Driven mad with hopeless longing...

1086
01:53:05,183 --> 01:53:08,482
...the second brother killed himself
so as to join her.

1087
01:53:09,688 --> 01:53:12,782
And so Death took the second brother.

1088
01:53:12,958 --> 01:53:14,585
As for the third brother...

1089
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:18,992
...Death searched for many years
but was never able to find him.

1090
01:53:19,164 --> 01:53:22,065
Only when he attained a great age
did the youngest brother...

1091
01:53:22,234 --> 01:53:26,500
...shed the Cloak of Invisibility
and give it to his son.

1092
01:53:27,739 --> 01:53:31,869
He then greeted Death as an old friend
and went with him gladly...

1093
01:53:32,043 --> 01:53:35,206
...departing this life as equals."

1094
01:53:37,282 --> 01:53:41,776
So there you are.
Those are the Deathly Hallows.

1095
01:53:43,188 --> 01:53:46,248
I'm sorry, sir.
I still don't quite understand.

1096
01:53:51,863 --> 01:53:53,956
Where's that pen I had?

1097
01:54:04,943 --> 01:54:06,205
The Elder Wand.

1098
01:54:07,345 --> 01:54:11,008
The most powerful wand ever made.

1099
01:54:21,393 --> 01:54:23,691
The Resurrection Stone.

1100
01:54:34,573 --> 01:54:38,339
The Cloak of Invisibility.

1101
01:54:40,378 --> 01:54:43,506
Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.

1102
01:54:43,782 --> 01:54:49,243
Together, they make one
master of Death.

1103
01:54:54,459 --> 01:54:58,122
That mark was on a grave
in Godric's Hollow.

1104
01:54:59,231 --> 01:55:01,859
Uh, Mr. Lovegood,
does the Peverell Family...

1105
01:55:02,033 --> 01:55:03,864
...have anything to do
with the Deathly Hallows?

1106
01:55:04,035 --> 01:55:06,868
Uh-- Uh--

1107
01:55:07,038 --> 01:55:10,804
Ignotus-- Excuse me. --and his brothers,
Cadmus and Antioch...

1108
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:13,638
...are thought to be the original owners
of the Hallows...

1109
01:55:13,812 --> 01:55:18,681
...and therefore the inspiration
for the story. Uh-- Uh--

1110
01:55:18,850 --> 01:55:21,341
But your tea's gone cold.

1111
01:55:22,554 --> 01:55:24,545
I'll be right back.

1112
01:55:24,723 --> 01:55:26,588
Let's go down here.

1113
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:29,950
Let's get out of here.

1114
01:55:30,128 --> 01:55:32,995
I'm not drinking any more of that stuff,
hot or cold.

1115
01:55:39,304 --> 01:55:41,272
Thank you, sir.

1116
01:55:42,173 --> 01:55:45,199
- You forgot the water.
- Water?

1117
01:55:45,377 --> 01:55:46,810
For the tea.

1118
01:55:46,978 --> 01:55:49,538
Did--? Did I?

1119
01:55:51,483 --> 01:55:53,644
How silly of me.

1120
01:55:55,253 --> 01:55:57,517
It's no matter.
We really should be going anyway.

1121
01:55:57,689 --> 01:55:59,748
No, you can't!

1122
01:56:03,962 --> 01:56:05,657
Sir?

1123
01:56:13,038 --> 01:56:15,632
You're my only hope.

1124
01:56:19,511 --> 01:56:23,880
They were angry, you see,
about what I'd been writing.

1125
01:56:26,918 --> 01:56:29,045
So they took her.

1126
01:56:30,522 --> 01:56:33,286
They took my Luna.

1127
01:56:34,993 --> 01:56:36,620
My Luna.

1128
01:56:49,107 --> 01:56:52,008
But it's really you they want.

1129
01:56:54,245 --> 01:56:56,304
Who took her, sir?

1130
01:57:01,453 --> 01:57:02,715
Voldemort.

1131
01:57:13,365 --> 01:57:15,663
Stop! I've got him!

1132
01:57:32,951 --> 01:57:36,853
That treacherous little bleeder.
Is there no one we can trust?

1133
01:57:37,022 --> 01:57:39,320
They kidnapped her
because he supported me.

1134
01:57:39,491 --> 01:57:41,618
He was just desperate.

1135
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:44,355
I'll do the enchantments.

1136
01:57:56,041 --> 01:57:57,474
Hello, beautiful.

1137
01:58:02,947 --> 01:58:06,576
Well, don't hang about, snatch them.

1138
01:59:17,822 --> 01:59:19,312
Harry.

1139
01:59:19,491 --> 01:59:22,460
Tell me, Grindelwald.
Tell me where it is.

1140
01:59:23,061 --> 01:59:27,122
Grindelwald. Grindelwald. Grindelwald.

1141
01:59:27,866 --> 01:59:31,324
Hello, Tom.
I knew you would come one day...

1142
01:59:31,803 --> 01:59:35,762
...but surely you must know
I no longer have what you seek.

1143
01:59:36,407 --> 01:59:39,433
- Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where it is.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1144
01:59:39,611 --> 01:59:40,976
Tell me who possesses it.

1145
01:59:41,179 --> 01:59:46,276
The Elder Wand lies with him,
of course...

1146
01:59:46,451 --> 01:59:48,715
...buried in the earth.

1147
01:59:49,654 --> 01:59:50,985
Dumbledore.

1148
02:00:00,031 --> 02:00:01,896
The Hallows exist...

1149
02:00:02,066 --> 02:00:05,866
...but he's only after one of them,
the last one. He knows where it is.

1150
02:00:06,037 --> 02:00:09,871
He's gonna have it by the end of the night.
You-Know-Who's found the Elder Wand.

1151
02:00:10,041 --> 02:00:12,509
- Don't touch her. Unh!
- Leave him.

1152
02:00:12,677 --> 02:00:13,939
Your boyfriend will get worse than that...

1153
02:00:14,112 --> 02:00:15,238
Get off me.

1154
02:00:15,413 --> 02:00:18,143
...if he doesn't learn to behave himself.

1155
02:00:21,386 --> 02:00:22,876
What happened to you, ugly?

1156
02:00:24,589 --> 02:00:26,454
No, not you.

1157
02:00:27,859 --> 02:00:30,919
- What's your name?
- Dudley. Vernon Dudley.

1158
02:00:31,095 --> 02:00:33,290
Check it.

1159
02:00:34,899 --> 02:00:37,231
And you, my lovely...

1160
02:00:40,538 --> 02:00:42,529
...what do they call you?

1161
02:00:43,975 --> 02:00:48,036
Penelope Clearwater, half-blood.

1162
02:00:51,149 --> 02:00:53,083
There's no Vernon Dudley on here.

1163
02:00:54,152 --> 02:00:57,383
Did you hear that, ugly?
The list says you're lying.

1164
02:00:57,555 --> 02:00:59,785
How come you don't want us
to know who you are?

1165
02:00:59,958 --> 02:01:02,620
The list's wrong. I told you who I am.

1166
02:01:18,576 --> 02:01:20,669
Change of plan.

1167
02:01:21,746 --> 02:01:25,011
We're not taking this lot to the Ministry.

1168
02:02:04,689 --> 02:02:08,318
Get Draco.

1169
02:02:12,797 --> 02:02:14,355
Well?

1170
02:02:17,468 --> 02:02:21,996
- I can't be sure.
- Draco. Look closely, son.

1171
02:02:23,007 --> 02:02:28,070
If we are the ones
to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord...

1172
02:02:28,246 --> 02:02:33,479
...everything would be forgiven.
All would be as it was, you understand?

1173
02:02:33,651 --> 02:02:37,781
Now, we won't be forgetting who
actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy.

1174
02:02:37,956 --> 02:02:40,390
You dare to
talk to me like that in my own house?

1175
02:02:40,558 --> 02:02:42,355
Lucius.

1176
02:02:45,263 --> 02:02:49,097
Don't be shy, sweetie. Come over.

1177
02:02:50,601 --> 02:02:55,368
Now, if this isn't who we think it is, Draco,
and we call him, he'll kill us all.

1178
02:02:55,540 --> 02:02:58,338
We need to be absolutely sure.

1179
02:02:58,643 --> 02:02:59,632
What's wrong with his face?

1180
02:02:59,811 --> 02:03:01,540
Yes, what is wrong with his face?

1181
02:03:01,713 --> 02:03:02,907
He came to us like that.

1182
02:03:03,081 --> 02:03:05,049
Something he picked up in the forest,
I reckon.

1183
02:03:05,216 --> 02:03:08,913
Or ran into a Stinging Jinx.
Was it you, dearie?

1184
02:03:14,025 --> 02:03:16,789
Give me her wand.
We'll see what her last spell was.

1185
02:03:18,062 --> 02:03:20,223
Ah. Got you.

1186
02:03:24,035 --> 02:03:25,764
What is that?

1187
02:03:27,705 --> 02:03:29,297
Where'd you get that from?

1188
02:03:29,474 --> 02:03:32,966
It was in her bag when we searched her.
Reckon it's mine now.

1189
02:03:36,714 --> 02:03:38,045
Are you mad?

1190
02:03:46,357 --> 02:03:49,190
Go! Get out!

1191
02:03:54,832 --> 02:03:58,996
Cissy, put the boys in the cellar.

1192
02:03:59,170 --> 02:04:04,540
I want to have a little conversation
with this one, girl-to-girl.

1193
02:04:13,584 --> 02:04:16,678
What are we gonna do?
We can't leave Hermione alone with her.

1194
02:04:16,854 --> 02:04:18,219
Ron?

1195
02:04:23,428 --> 02:04:24,986
Harry?

1196
02:04:30,701 --> 02:04:32,259
Luna?

1197
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:37,034
That sword is meant to be in my vault
at Gringotts. How did you get it?

1198
02:04:37,208 --> 02:04:40,336
What else did you and your friends take
from my vault?!

1199
02:04:40,511 --> 02:04:45,881
I didn't take anything. Please.
I didn't take anything.

1200
02:04:46,050 --> 02:04:47,574
I don't believe it.

1201
02:04:53,157 --> 02:04:54,249
We have to do something.

1202
02:04:54,425 --> 02:04:58,452
There's no way out of here.
We've tried everything. It's enchanted.

1203
02:04:58,629 --> 02:05:01,325
- Please! please!
- Shut up!

1204
02:05:01,499 --> 02:05:03,296
You're bleeding, Harry.

1205
02:05:03,468 --> 02:05:05,493
That's a curious thing
to keep in your sock.

1206
02:05:14,745 --> 02:05:15,871
Help us.

1207
02:05:21,652 --> 02:05:23,552
- Let her go.
- Shut up. Get back.

1208
02:05:24,889 --> 02:05:29,087
You, goblin, come with me.

1209
02:05:48,746 --> 02:05:50,236
- Aah!
- Dobby?

1210
02:05:51,115 --> 02:05:52,514
What are you doing here?

1211
02:05:52,683 --> 02:05:54,947
Dobby has come to rescue
Harry Potter, of course.

1212
02:05:55,119 --> 02:05:57,587
Dobby will always be there
for Harry Potter.

1213
02:05:57,755 --> 02:06:01,350
You can Apparate in and out of this room?
Could you take us with you?

1214
02:06:01,526 --> 02:06:03,289
Of course, sir. I'm an elf.

1215
02:06:04,095 --> 02:06:05,960
Works for me.

1216
02:06:06,197 --> 02:06:08,563
Dobby, I want you to take Luna
and Mr. Ollivander--

1217
02:06:08,733 --> 02:06:11,167
Shell Cottage
on the outskirts of Tinworth.

1218
02:06:11,536 --> 02:06:12,560
Trust me.

1219
02:06:13,371 --> 02:06:14,804
Whenever you're ready, sir.

1220
02:06:15,506 --> 02:06:18,202
Sir? I like her very much.

1221
02:06:23,147 --> 02:06:26,446
Meet me at the top of the stairs
in 10 seconds.

1222
02:06:35,526 --> 02:06:37,289
Ow.

1223
02:06:42,700 --> 02:06:44,930
Who gets his wand?

1224
02:06:47,672 --> 02:06:51,665
I'm only going to
ask you once more, goblin.

1225
02:06:51,842 --> 02:06:55,243
Think very, very carefully
before you answer.

1226
02:06:55,613 --> 02:06:57,171
I don't know.

1227
02:06:57,348 --> 02:07:00,545
You don't know?
Why weren't you doing your job?

1228
02:07:00,718 --> 02:07:03,949
Who got into my vault?

1229
02:07:05,223 --> 02:07:09,660
Who stole it? Who stole it? Well?

1230
02:07:09,827 --> 02:07:13,854
When I was last in your vault,
the sword was there.

1231
02:07:16,634 --> 02:07:19,831
Oh, well then, perhaps
it just walked out on its own then.

1232
02:07:20,004 --> 02:07:22,438
There is no place safer than Gringotts.

1233
02:07:22,607 --> 02:07:24,040
Liar!

1234
02:07:25,977 --> 02:07:29,378
Consider yourself lucky, goblin.

1235
02:07:31,816 --> 02:07:35,217
The same won't be said for this one.

1236
02:07:35,386 --> 02:07:37,149
Like hell.

1237
02:07:37,888 --> 02:07:39,116
Expelliarmus!

1238
02:07:40,558 --> 02:07:41,650
Stupefy.

1239
02:07:45,796 --> 02:07:47,161
Stop!

1240
02:07:48,332 --> 02:07:49,890
Drop your wands.

1241
02:07:52,770 --> 02:07:53,794
I said, drop them!

1242
02:07:55,306 --> 02:07:56,739
Pick them up, Draco, now.

1243
02:07:57,608 --> 02:08:01,738
Well, well, well,
look what we have here.

1244
02:08:03,347 --> 02:08:04,837
It's Harry Potter.

1245
02:08:05,616 --> 02:08:11,987
He's all bright and shiny and new again,
just in time for the Dark Lord.

1246
02:08:12,156 --> 02:08:14,181
Call him.

1247
02:08:17,928 --> 02:08:19,725
Call him.

1248
02:08:54,932 --> 02:08:56,763
Stupefy!

1249
02:08:57,535 --> 02:08:59,230
Stupid elf.

1250
02:08:59,403 --> 02:09:02,429
- You could've killed me.
- Dobby never meant to kill.

1251
02:09:02,606 --> 02:09:06,633
Dobby only meant to maim
or seriously injure.

1252
02:09:08,946 --> 02:09:12,279
How dare you take a witch's wand?

1253
02:09:12,450 --> 02:09:15,442
How dare you defy your masters?

1254
02:09:15,619 --> 02:09:18,747
Dobby has no master.

1255
02:09:18,923 --> 02:09:21,414
Dobby is a free elf.

1256
02:09:21,592 --> 02:09:26,552
And Dobby has come
to save Harry Potter and his friends.

1257
02:09:56,394 --> 02:09:58,055
Hermione.

1258
02:09:58,229 --> 02:10:00,720
You're all right. We're safe.

1259
02:10:00,898 --> 02:10:02,923
We're all safe.

1260
02:10:03,801 --> 02:10:05,996
Harry Potter.

1261
02:10:09,740 --> 02:10:11,571
Dobby.

1262
02:10:22,086 --> 02:10:25,146
Dobby. No, just-- Hold on.

1263
02:10:25,322 --> 02:10:29,656
Hold on. Look, just hold on, okay?

1264
02:10:29,827 --> 02:10:31,886
We'll fix you.

1265
02:10:32,329 --> 02:10:35,059
Hermione will have something.

1266
02:10:35,232 --> 02:10:37,564
In your bag. Hermione?

1267
02:10:39,203 --> 02:10:40,534
Hermione?

1268
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:45,868
What is it? Help me.

1269
02:10:48,446 --> 02:10:51,574
Such a beautiful place...

1270
02:10:53,751 --> 02:10:56,015
...to be with friends.

1271
02:10:57,822 --> 02:11:03,226
Dobby is happy to be with his friend...

1272
02:11:05,629 --> 02:11:08,063
...Harry Potter.

1273
02:11:28,853 --> 02:11:31,253
We should close his eyes.

1274
02:11:31,489 --> 02:11:33,514
Don't you think?

1275
02:11:38,629 --> 02:11:40,028
There.

1276
02:11:40,498 --> 02:11:42,932
Now he could be sleeping.

1277
02:11:58,249 --> 02:12:00,308
I want to bury him.

1278
02:12:01,352 --> 02:12:04,913
Properly. Without magic.
