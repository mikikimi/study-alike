1
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:15,224
l can't let you out, Hedwig.

2
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:18,952
l'm not allowed to use magic
outside of school.

3
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:23,297
-Besides, if Uncle Vernon--
-Harry Potter!

4
00:01:25,135 --> 00:01:26,762
Now you've done it.

5
00:01:31,574 --> 00:01:34,270
He's in there. Vernon?

6
00:01:36,613 --> 00:01:40,379
l'm warning you, if you can't control
that bloody bird, it'll have to go.

7
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,349
But she's bored.

8
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:47,013
lf l could only let her out
for an hour or two.

9
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,149
So you can send secret messages
to your freaky little friends? No, sir.

10
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:56,458
But l haven't had any messages
from any of my friends.

11
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,260
Not one...

12
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,168
...all summer.

13
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:03,567
Who would want to be
friends with you?

14
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:08,276
l should think you'd be
a little more grateful.

15
00:02:08,444 --> 00:02:11,936
We've raised you since you were a baby,
given you the food off our table...

16
00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:14,242
...even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom...

17
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:16,942
...purely out of the goodness
of our hearts.

18
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:23,155
-Not now. lt's for when the Masons arrive.
-Which should be any minute.

19
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:26,626
Now, let's go over our schedule
once again, shall we?

20
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:28,730
Petunia, when the Masons arrive,
you will be...?

21
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,595
ln the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

22
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:36,705
-Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
-l'll be waiting to open the door.

23
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:38,773
Excellent.

24
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:45,177
And you?

25
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:50,117
l'll be in my bedroom, making no noise
and pretending that l don't exist.

26
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:52,015
Too right, you will.

27
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:55,680
With any luck, this could be the day
l make the biggest deal of my career...

28
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:59,386
...and you will not mess it up.

29
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,375
Harry Potter, such an honor it is.

30
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:23,151
-Who are you?
-Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.

31
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,251
Not to be rude or anything...

32
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:29,380
...but this isn't a great time for me
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.

33
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:32,050
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.

34
00:03:32,228 --> 00:03:35,322
lt's just that Dobby
has come to tell you....

35
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:40,333
lt is difficult, sir.
Dobby wonders where to begin.

36
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:46,305
-Why don't you sit down?
-Sit down? Sit down?

37
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:54,073
Dobby, l'm sorry. l didn't mean
to offend you or anything.

38
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,411
Offend Dobby?

39
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:58,918
Dobby has heard
of your greatness, sir...

40
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:04,856
...but never has he been asked
to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.

41
00:04:05,795 --> 00:04:08,423
You can't have met
many decent wizards then.

42
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:10,998
No, l haven't.

43
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,931
That was an awful thing to say.

44
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,028
-Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
-Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.

45
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:19,572
Dobby, please, stop.

46
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,708
Don't mind that. lt's just the cat.

47
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:33,179
-Bad Dobby.
-Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.

48
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,654
Are you all right?

49
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:39,259
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.

50
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:42,660
Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family, sir.

51
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:46,768
-Your family?
-The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.

52
00:04:46,936 --> 00:04:49,928
Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.

53
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:52,666
lf they ever knew Dobby was here....

54
00:04:54,310 --> 00:05:00,078
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.

55
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:02,547
Harry Potter must not go back...

56
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:07,418
...to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.

57
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:12,755
There is a plot, a plot to make
most terrible things happen.

58
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:16,262
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?

59
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:19,601
Can't say.

60
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:25,769
-Okay, l understand. You can't say.
-Don't make me talk. l--

61
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,475
-Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down.
-Bad Dobby.

62
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:34,707
So when they arrive
at the ninth hole....

63
00:05:37,286 --> 00:05:39,880
Give me the lamp.

64
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,991
Dobby, stop!

65
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:49,154
-Let me go.
-Get in there and keep quiet.

66
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:53,393
-What the devil are you doing up here?
-l was just--

67
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:56,299
You just ruined the punch line
of my Japanese golfer joke.

68
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:58,305
Sorry.

69
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:03,937
One more sound and you'll wish
you'd never been born, boy.

70
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,913
-And fix that door.
-Yes, sir.

71
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:11,813
See why l've got to go back?

72
00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:15,754
l don't belong here.
l belong in your world, at Hogwarts.

73
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:20,555
-lt's the only place l've got friends.
-Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?

74
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,631
Well, l expect they've been....

75
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,464
Hang on. How do you know
my friends haven't been writing to me?

76
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:31,999
Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Dobby.

77
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:36,373
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him...

78
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:40,209
...Harry Potter might not want
to go back to school, sir.

79
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,817
-Give me those. Now.
-No!

80
00:06:58,134 --> 00:07:01,433
Dobby, get back here.

81
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:07,906
Dobby, please, no.

82
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:12,275
Harry Potter must say
he's not going back to school.

83
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:15,049
l can't. Hogwarts is my home.

84
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:21,315
Then Dobby must do it, sir,
for Harry Potter's own good.

85
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:26,485
lt spread as far as the eye could see,
all over the floor of this building.

86
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:28,630
One plumber said,
''Look at all that water.''

87
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:31,790
The second plumber said,
''Yes, and that's just the top of it.''

88
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,810
Mr. Mason.

89
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,010
Vernon tells me that
you're a wonderful golfer.

90
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,970
l play occasionally.

91
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,410
Mrs. Mason.

92
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,890
Where do you get
your beautiful suits?

93
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,490
All of my suits are tailor-made.

94
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,850
Dudley.

95
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,770
Wasn't there something
you wanted to say?

96
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,530
-Pudding.
-Pudding? What pudding?

97
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,330
l'm so sorry. lt's my nephew.
He's very disturbed.

98
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,170
Meeting strangers upsets him.
That's why l kept him upstairs.

99
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,570
Well, we have ice cream.

100
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,534
You're never going back to that school.

101
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:52,730
You're never going to see those
freaky friends of yours again. Never!

102
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,012
Hiya, Harry.

103
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:45,559
Ron. Fred. George.
What are you all doing here?

104
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:49,629
Rescuing you, of course.
Now, come on, get your trunk.

105
00:09:55,837 --> 00:09:58,032
You better stand back.

106
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,600
Let's go.

107
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:07,280
-What was that?
-What was it?

108
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:11,746
Potter!

109
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,581
Dad, what's going on?

110
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:17,882
Go. Go. Go.

111
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:19,083
Dad, hurry up.

112
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:23,159
-Come on.
-Come on, Harry, hurry up.

113
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,930
Petunia, he's escaping!

114
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,660
-l've got you, Harry.
-Come here!

115
00:10:31,105 --> 00:10:32,936
-Let go of me!
-No, boy!

116
00:10:33,107 --> 00:10:36,099
You and that bloody pigeon
aren't going anywhere.

117
00:10:36,277 --> 00:10:37,904
-Get off!
-Drive!

118
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,944
-Right.
-Right!

119
00:10:40,114 --> 00:10:41,775
No! No! No! No!

120
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,950
Dad!

121
00:10:57,098 --> 00:10:58,588
Damn.

122
00:11:02,737 --> 00:11:06,605
By the way, Harry, happy birthday.

123
00:11:32,934 --> 00:11:34,731
Come on.

124
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:39,338
Okay, come on.

125
00:11:40,174 --> 00:11:42,404
Okay, come on.

126
00:11:50,618 --> 00:11:54,679
-Think it'd be all right if we had some?
-Yeah, Mum will never know.

127
00:12:11,406 --> 00:12:14,603
lt's not much, but it's home.

128
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,040
l think it's brilliant.

129
00:12:17,812 --> 00:12:21,578
Where have you been?

130
00:12:21,983 --> 00:12:25,009
Harry, how wonderful
to see you, dear.

131
00:12:25,186 --> 00:12:28,781
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.

132
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,949
You could have died.
You could have been seen.

133
00:12:32,527 --> 00:12:35,155
Of course, l don't
blame you, Harry, dear.

134
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,356
They were starving him, Mum.
There were bars on his window.

135
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:43,300
Well, you best hope l don't put bars
on your window, Ronald Weasley.

136
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,598
Come on, Harry,
time for a spot of breakfast.

137
00:12:46,741 --> 00:12:49,505
Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.

138
00:12:49,677 --> 00:12:53,272
That's it. There we go.

139
00:12:53,748 --> 00:12:57,275
-Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
-Yes, dear, it was on the cat.

140
00:12:57,852 --> 00:12:59,513
Hello.

141
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:05,223
What did l do?

142
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:09,989
Ginny. She's been talking about you
all summer. A bit annoying, really.

143
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,758
-Morning, Weasleys.
-Morning, Dad.

144
00:13:13,735 --> 00:13:17,501
-What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
-Raids?

145
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:21,602
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic,
in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.

146
00:13:21,976 --> 00:13:25,104
Dad loves Muggles,
thinks they're fascinating.

147
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,509
Well, now.

148
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:30,645
And who are you?

149
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:34,980
Sorry, sir. l'm Harry, sir.
Harry Potter.

150
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,257
Good Lord. Are you really?

151
00:13:38,826 --> 00:13:43,160
Well, Ron has told us all about you,
of course. When did he get here?

152
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:44,821
This morning.

153
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:50,193
Your sons flew that enchanted car
of yours to Surrey and back last night.

154
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,807
Did you really? How did it go?

155
00:13:53,975 --> 00:13:58,810
l mean-- That was very wrong
indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.

156
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:04,016
Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.

157
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:08,281
Tell me, what exactly
is the function of a rubber duck?

158
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,590
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.

159
00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:24,133
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?

160
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:27,703
-Errol.
-He's always doing that.

161
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:33,302
Look, it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.

162
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:36,541
Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.

163
00:14:36,718 --> 00:14:38,652
-No.
-This lot won't come cheap.

164
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,154
-The spell books alone are very expensive.
-We'll manage.

165
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:48,157
There's only one place we're going to
get all of this. Diagon Alley.

166
00:14:49,363 --> 00:14:50,762
Right.

167
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,025
Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.

168
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:56,193
But Harry's never traveled
by Floo powder before, Mum.

169
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,394
Floo powder?

170
00:14:57,572 --> 00:15:01,838
You go first, Ron, so that Harry
can see how it's done. Yes.

171
00:15:02,477 --> 00:15:04,342
ln you go.

172
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:11,612
Diagon Alley.

173
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:21,150
You see? lt's quite easy, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.

174
00:15:22,897 --> 00:15:24,125
Come on.

175
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,495
ln you go. That's it. Mind your head.

176
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:31,069
That's right.
Now, take your Floo powder.

177
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,074
That's it, very good.

178
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:39,612
Now, don't forget to speak
very, very clearly.

179
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:43,815
Diagonally.

180
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,691
-What did he say, dear?
-Diagonally.

181
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,918
l thought he did.

182
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,100
Don't touch anything, Draco.

183
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,540
Yes, Father.

184
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,700
Mr. Malfoy,
what a pleasure to see you again.

185
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,020
And young Master Malfoy too. Delighted.

186
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,300
l must show you, just in today,
and very reasonably priced--

187
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,780
-l'm not buying today, Borgin. l'm selling.
-Selling?

188
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,540
Draco.

189
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,300
You're aware, no doubt,
that the Ministry of Magic...

190
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,540
...is conducting more raids
on private houses.

191
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,860
There's even rumors
of a new Muggle Protection Act.

192
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,620
Pure wizard blood is counting for less
everywhere, l'm afraid.

193
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,700
Not with me.

194
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:12,220
Anyway, l brought a few items
from home that might prove...

195
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:17,540
...embarrassing were the Ministry to call.
Poisons and the like.

196
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,220
Look at this.

197
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:29,140
That particular item is not for sale.

198
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,420
l understand. lt has unique qualities.

199
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,780
One wouldn't want to see it
falling into the wrong hands.

200
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,700
You can keep the box.

201
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,140
What did l say?

202
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,940
-Touch nothing.
-Exactly.

203
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,460
Sorry, Father.

204
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,980
Come on. We're going.

205
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,740
lt's a pleasure to do business with you,
Mr. Malfoy.

206
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,220
Always a pleasure.

207
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:38,271
-Looking for something?
-No, l....

208
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:40,151
l'm just in the wrong place.

209
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:42,111
Sorry.

210
00:19:43,631 --> 00:19:45,311
Thank you.

211
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:06,154
-Not lost, are you, my dear?
-l'm fine, thank you. l was just going....

212
00:20:06,324 --> 00:20:10,818
Come with us. We'll help you
find your way back.

213
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:13,695
-No. Please--
-Harry?

214
00:20:13,865 --> 00:20:14,923
Hagrid!

215
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,126
What do you think
you're doing down here? Come on.

216
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:29,176
You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around
Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

217
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:33,340
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.

218
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:35,748
l was lost, l--

219
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:38,890
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?

220
00:20:39,057 --> 00:20:44,188
Me? l was.... l was looking
for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.

221
00:20:44,362 --> 00:20:47,263
They're ruining all the school cabbages.

222
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,321
Harry. Hagrid.

223
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:56,928
Hello, Hermione.

224
00:20:57,331 --> 00:20:59,959
-lt's so good to see you.
-lt's great to see you too.

225
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:03,195
What did you do to your glasses?

226
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,237
Oculus Reparo.

227
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,440
l definitely need to remember that one.

228
00:21:12,613 --> 00:21:16,344
You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Right. l'll leave you to it.

229
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:17,984
-Okay, bye.
-Thank you. Bye.

230
00:21:18,252 --> 00:21:20,117
Come on, everyone's been so worried.

231
00:21:30,864 --> 00:21:31,956
Harry.

232
00:21:32,132 --> 00:21:35,363
Thank goodness. We'd hoped
you'd only gone one grate too far.

233
00:21:35,536 --> 00:21:38,369
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.

234
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:40,803
Here he is.

235
00:21:44,812 --> 00:21:46,439
Mum fancies him.

236
00:21:46,613 --> 00:21:49,878
Make way there, please.
Let me by, madam. Thank you.

237
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:53,486
Excuse me, little girl.
This is for the Daily Prophet.

238
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,558
lt can't be. Harry Potter?

239
00:22:02,096 --> 00:22:03,961
Harry Potter!

240
00:22:04,131 --> 00:22:05,325
Excuse me, madam.

241
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:11,202
Nice big smile, Harry.
Together, you and l rate the front page.

242
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,535
Ladies and gentlemen,
what an extraordinary moment this is.

243
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:18,105
When young Harry stepped
into Flourish and Blotts this morning...

244
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:22,374
...to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me...

245
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,753
...which, incidentally,
is currently celebrating...

246
00:22:28,922 --> 00:22:33,757
...its 27th week atop
the Daily Prophet bestseller list...

247
00:22:33,927 --> 00:22:38,421
...he had no idea that he would,
in fact, be leaving...

248
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,503
...with my entire collected works...

249
00:22:45,105 --> 00:22:47,300
...free of charge.

250
00:22:49,476 --> 00:22:51,706
Now, ladies?

251
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:55,107
Harry, now you give me those,
and l'll get them signed.

252
00:22:55,282 --> 00:22:58,774
All of you wait outside.
That's it.

253
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,586
l'll bet you loved that,
didn't you, Potter?

254
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:15,258
Famous Harry Potter. Can't even go into
a bookshop without making the front page.

255
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:17,598
Leave him alone.

256
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:21,263
Look, Potter.
You've got yourself a girlfriend.

257
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:25,469
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.

258
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:27,107
Mr. Potter.

259
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,509
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.

260
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:35,882
Forgive me.

261
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,316
Your scar is legend.

262
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,124
As, of course, is the wizard
who gave it to you.

263
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,590
Voldemort killed my parents.

264
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,158
He was nothing more than a murderer.

265
00:23:51,205 --> 00:23:54,140
You must be very brave
to mention his name.

266
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,105
Or very foolish.

267
00:23:56,543 --> 00:24:00,070
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

268
00:24:01,682 --> 00:24:04,947
And you must be Miss Granger.

269
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:12,087
Yes, Draco has told me
all about you. And your parents.

270
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,188
Muggles, aren't they?

271
00:24:23,136 --> 00:24:28,233
Let me see.
Red hair, vacant expressions...

272
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:32,975
...tatty, secondhand book.

273
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:36,544
You must be the Weasleys.

274
00:24:36,984 --> 00:24:39,009
lt's mad in here.
Let's go outside.

275
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,883
-Well, well, well. Weasley senior.
-Lucius.

276
00:24:43,056 --> 00:24:47,720
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur,
all those extra raids?

277
00:24:47,895 --> 00:24:50,227
l do hope they're paying you overtime...

278
00:24:50,397 --> 00:24:53,560
...but judging by the state of this,
l'd say not.

279
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:59,100
What's the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard...

280
00:24:59,273 --> 00:25:01,332
...if they don't even pay you well for it?

281
00:25:01,642 --> 00:25:06,636
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

282
00:25:06,914 --> 00:25:08,711
Clearly.

283
00:25:10,784 --> 00:25:14,481
Associating with Muggles.

284
00:25:18,692 --> 00:25:23,288
And l thought your family
could sink no lower.

285
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,398
l'll see you at work.

286
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,906
See you at school.

287
00:25:43,717 --> 00:25:46,413
-10:58. Come on.
-The train will be leaving any moment.

288
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:49,852
Fred, George, Percy, you first.

289
00:25:55,462 --> 00:25:57,089
Okay.

290
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,865
After you, dear.

291
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,271
Come on, Ginny,
we'll get you a seat. Hurry.

292
00:26:11,545 --> 00:26:13,638
Let's go.

293
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:30,724
-What do you two think you're doing?
-Sorry.

294
00:26:31,164 --> 00:26:34,156
Lost control of the trolley.

295
00:26:35,502 --> 00:26:37,834
-Why can't we get through?
-l don't know.

296
00:26:38,005 --> 00:26:41,372
The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.

297
00:26:42,743 --> 00:26:46,679
The train leaves at exactly 11 :00.
We've missed it.

298
00:26:46,847 --> 00:26:50,214
Harry, if we can't get through...

299
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:53,179
...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

300
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,590
Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.

301
00:26:58,659 --> 00:26:59,990
The car.

302
00:27:08,152 --> 00:27:09,232
There we go.

303
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:13,032
Now, all we need to do
is find the Hogwarts Express.

304
00:27:13,192 --> 00:27:15,632
Ron, are you sure you know
how to fly this?

305
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:17,472
No problem.

306
00:27:24,072 --> 00:27:25,792
Look out!

307
00:27:31,346 --> 00:27:33,507
Ron, l should tell you...

308
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:37,447
...most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.

309
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:38,711
Right.

310
00:27:39,053 --> 00:27:40,042
Okay.

311
00:27:57,338 --> 00:28:00,637
Oh, no! The lnvisibility Booster
must be faulty.

312
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:04,237
Come on, then. Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.

313
00:28:04,412 --> 00:28:05,674
Okay.

314
00:28:16,624 --> 00:28:18,649
All we need to do is catch up
with the train.

315
00:28:18,826 --> 00:28:20,487
We can't be far behind.

316
00:28:22,497 --> 00:28:25,227
-Do you hear that?
-We must be getting close.

317
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,761
Hold on.

318
00:28:54,095 --> 00:28:56,222
Harry!

319
00:28:58,866 --> 00:29:00,697
Hold on!

320
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:06,529
Take my hand!

321
00:29:10,812 --> 00:29:12,040
Hold on!

322
00:29:12,213 --> 00:29:15,808
l'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.

323
00:29:28,396 --> 00:29:31,695
-l think we found the train.
-Yeah.

324
00:29:48,383 --> 00:29:49,611
Welcome home.

325
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:06,995
Up! Up!

326
00:30:07,935 --> 00:30:10,096
lt's not working!

327
00:30:14,042 --> 00:30:16,602
Up! Ron, mind that tree!

328
00:30:19,881 --> 00:30:22,008
Stop! Stop! Stop!

329
00:30:45,106 --> 00:30:49,736
-My wand. Look at my wand.
-Be thankful it's not your neck.

330
00:30:51,379 --> 00:30:54,348
-What's happening?
-l don't know.

331
00:31:29,817 --> 00:31:31,944
Come on, go! Fast!

332
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,118
Scabbers, you're okay.

333
00:32:10,093 --> 00:32:12,118
The car!

334
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:29,408
Dad's gonna kill me.

335
00:32:37,987 --> 00:32:40,319
See you, Hedwig.

336
00:32:41,658 --> 00:32:43,990
So a house-elf shows up
in my bedroom...

337
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,129
...we can't get through the barrier
to platform 93/4...

338
00:32:47,297 --> 00:32:50,528
...we almost get killed by a tree....

339
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,227
Clearly someone doesn't want me
here this year.

340
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,775
Well, take a good look, lads.

341
00:33:00,943 --> 00:33:04,879
This night might well be
the last you spend in this castle.

342
00:33:07,684 --> 00:33:11,176
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.

343
00:33:11,454 --> 00:33:17,654
You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.

344
00:33:18,094 --> 00:33:20,858
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

345
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:25,398
You have risked
the exposure of our world.

346
00:33:26,069 --> 00:33:29,004
Not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a Whomping Willow...

347
00:33:29,172 --> 00:33:32,300
...that's been on these grounds
since before you were born.

348
00:33:32,775 --> 00:33:36,336
Honestly, Professor Snape,
l think it did more damage to us.

349
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,672
Silence.

350
00:33:39,682 --> 00:33:46,053
l assure you that were you in Slytherin,
and your fate rested with me...

351
00:33:46,222 --> 00:33:49,988
...the both of you would be
on the train home tonight.

352
00:33:51,194 --> 00:33:53,424
-As it is--
-They are not.

353
00:33:55,631 --> 00:33:59,692
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.

354
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:01,559
Headmaster...

355
00:34:01,738 --> 00:34:06,539
...these boys have flouted the Decree
for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.

356
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:10,611
-As such--
-l am well aware of our bylaws, Severus...

357
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,647
...having written
quite a few of them myself.

358
00:34:14,016 --> 00:34:17,247
However, as head of Gryffindor house...

359
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:22,414
...it is for Professor McGonagall
to determine the appropriate action.

360
00:34:22,892 --> 00:34:25,053
We'll go and get our stuff, then.

361
00:34:25,228 --> 00:34:27,662
What are you
talking about, Mr. Weasley?

362
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,025
You're going to expel us, aren't you?

363
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:34,729
Not today, Mr. Weasley...

364
00:34:34,904 --> 00:34:39,898
...but l must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done.

365
00:34:40,443 --> 00:34:45,073
l will be writing to your families tonight,
and you will both receive detention.

366
00:35:10,974 --> 00:35:13,334
Mr. Filch, you dropped this.

367
00:35:48,201 --> 00:35:50,726
-Good morning, everyone.
-Good morning, Professor Sprout.

368
00:35:50,904 --> 00:35:55,204
Welcome to Greenhouse Three,
second years. Gather around, everyone.

369
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:58,173
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.

370
00:35:58,345 --> 00:36:02,338
Who here can tell me
the properties of the Mandrake root?

371
00:36:02,516 --> 00:36:04,381
Yes, Miss Granger?

372
00:36:04,551 --> 00:36:06,849
Mandrake, or Mandragora...

373
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:12,048
...is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.

374
00:36:12,225 --> 00:36:17,219
lt's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

375
00:36:17,397 --> 00:36:20,230
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

376
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,062
As our Mandrakes
are still only seedlings...

377
00:36:23,236 --> 00:36:25,136
...their cries won't kill you yet.

378
00:36:25,305 --> 00:36:29,105
But they could knock you out for several hours,
which is why l have given you earmuffs...

379
00:36:29,276 --> 00:36:30,766
...for auditory protection.

380
00:36:30,944 --> 00:36:35,381
So could you please put them on,
right away? Quickly.

381
00:36:35,549 --> 00:36:38,347
Flaps tight down,
and watch me closely.

382
00:36:38,518 --> 00:36:41,510
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.

383
00:36:41,688 --> 00:36:44,680
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.

384
00:36:48,962 --> 00:36:50,862
Got it? And...

385
00:36:51,064 --> 00:36:53,191
...now you dunk it down
into the other pot...

386
00:36:53,366 --> 00:36:58,065
...and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm.

387
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:04,905
Longbottom's been neglecting
his earmuffs.

388
00:37:05,345 --> 00:37:09,372
-No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
-Yes, well, just leave him there.

389
00:37:09,783 --> 00:37:13,310
Right, on we go.
Plenty of pots to go around.

390
00:37:13,487 --> 00:37:17,048
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.

391
00:37:32,005 --> 00:37:35,771
-There's Nearly Headless Nick.
-Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.

392
00:37:35,942 --> 00:37:38,502
Hello, Sir Nicholas.

393
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:53,255
Say it. l'm doomed.

394
00:37:53,894 --> 00:37:55,828
-You're doomed.
-Hi, Harry.

395
00:37:58,065 --> 00:38:00,795
l'm Colin Creevey. l'm in Gryffindor too.

396
00:38:01,183 --> 00:38:04,183
-Hi, Colin, nice to meet you.
-Say, do you think your friend here...

397
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:06,703
...could take a photo
of me and you standing together?

398
00:38:06,943 --> 00:38:09,463
You know, to prove l've met you.
lt's for my dad.

399
00:38:09,703 --> 00:38:13,183
He's a milkman, you know. A Muggle,
like all our family's been until me.

400
00:38:13,423 --> 00:38:17,063
No one knew all the stuff l could do was
magic till we got our Hogwarts letter.

401
00:38:17,303 --> 00:38:19,063
Everyone just thought l was mental.

402
00:38:19,703 --> 00:38:21,503
lmagine that.

403
00:38:22,353 --> 00:38:24,184
Ron, is that your owl?

404
00:38:38,936 --> 00:38:41,598
Bloody bird's a menace.

405
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,300
Oh, no.

406
00:38:47,478 --> 00:38:50,936
Look, everyone.
Weasley's got himself a Howler.

407
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:58,097
Go on, Ron. l ignored one
from my gran once. lt was horrible.

408
00:39:05,277 --> 00:39:07,142
Ronald Weasley!

409
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:15,845
How dare you steal that car!
l am absolutely disgusted!

410
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:18,748
Your father's now facing
an inquiry at work...

411
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:21,290
...and it's entirely your fault!

412
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,628
lf you put another toe out of line...

413
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:29,062
...we'll bring you straight home!

414
00:39:29,335 --> 00:39:32,827
And, Ginny, dear, congratulations
on making Gryffindor.

415
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:36,736
Your father and l are so proud.

416
00:39:54,994 --> 00:40:01,422
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

417
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,124
Me.

418
00:40:03,302 --> 00:40:05,827
Gilderoy Lockhart...

419
00:40:06,005 --> 00:40:09,304
...Order of Merlin, Third Class...

420
00:40:09,475 --> 00:40:12,808
...honorary member
of the Dark Force Defense League...

421
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:15,879
...and five times winner...

422
00:40:16,215 --> 00:40:22,120
...of Witch Weekly's
Most-Charming-Smile Award.

423
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:23,978
But l don't talk about that.

424
00:40:24,156 --> 00:40:28,684
l didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee
by smiling at him.

425
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:35,871
l see you've all bought a complete
set of my books. Well done.

426
00:40:36,071 --> 00:40:41,431
Now, l thought we'd start today
with a little quiz.

427
00:40:43,511 --> 00:40:45,391
Nothing to worry about.

428
00:40:45,551 --> 00:40:49,151
Just to check how well
you've read them.

429
00:40:49,311 --> 00:40:50,871
Thank you.

430
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:55,391
How much you've taken in.

431
00:41:00,351 --> 00:41:03,991
Look at these questions.
They're all about him.

432
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:07,311
''What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
favorite color?''

433
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:12,471
''What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
greatest achievement to date?''

434
00:41:16,111 --> 00:41:18,231
You have 30 minutes. Start...

435
00:41:21,751 --> 00:41:23,111
...now.

436
00:41:31,311 --> 00:41:35,431
Hardly any of you remembered
that my favorite color is lilac.

437
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:38,551
But Miss Hermione Granger knew...

438
00:41:38,711 --> 00:41:42,631
...that my secret ambition
is to rid the world of evil...

439
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:47,431
...and market my own range
of hair-care potions. Good girl.

440
00:41:48,595 --> 00:41:51,462
Now, be warned.

441
00:41:51,731 --> 00:41:53,790
lt is my job to arm you...

442
00:41:53,967 --> 00:41:59,269
...against the foulest creatures
known to wizardkind.

443
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,701
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.

444
00:42:03,877 --> 00:42:07,904
Know only that no harm
can befall you whilst l am here.

445
00:42:08,081 --> 00:42:11,016
l must ask you not to scream.

446
00:42:11,184 --> 00:42:13,744
lt might provoke them.

447
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:18,603
Cornish pixies?

448
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,806
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

449
00:42:22,617 --> 00:42:24,744
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...

450
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,084
...but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters.

451
00:42:29,257 --> 00:42:32,158
Let's see what you make of them.

452
00:42:36,498 --> 00:42:39,763
Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.

453
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:59,646
-You just stay there!
-Please, get me down!

454
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,458
-Get off me!
-Stop. Hold still!

455
00:43:06,094 --> 00:43:09,291
Peskipiksi Pesternomi!

456
00:43:29,284 --> 00:43:33,550
l'll ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their cage.

457
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:37,484
What do we do now?

458
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:40,484
lmmobulus!

459
00:43:50,005 --> 00:43:52,269
Why is it always me?

460
00:43:58,613 --> 00:44:01,309
l spent the summer devising
a whole new Quidditch program.

461
00:44:01,483 --> 00:44:05,146
We're gonna train earlier,
harder and longer.

462
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,619
What--? l don't believe it.

463
00:44:11,393 --> 00:44:14,089
-Where you think you're going, Flint?
-Quidditch practice.

464
00:44:14,262 --> 00:44:18,665
-l booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
-Easy, Wood. l've got a note.

465
00:44:20,068 --> 00:44:22,263
l smell trouble.

466
00:44:22,871 --> 00:44:26,398
''l, Professor Severus Snape,
do hereby give the Slytherin team...

467
00:44:26,575 --> 00:44:30,067
...permission to practice today, owing
to the need to train their new Seeker.''

468
00:44:30,245 --> 00:44:32,907
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

469
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:39,513
-Malfoy?
-That's right.

470
00:44:39,688 --> 00:44:42,452
And that's not all
that's new this year.

471
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:46,727
Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
How did you get those?

472
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:48,988
A gift from Draco's father.

473
00:44:49,164 --> 00:44:52,895
You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.

474
00:44:53,068 --> 00:44:56,060
At least no one on the Gryffindor team
had to buy their way in.

475
00:44:56,238 --> 00:44:59,173
They got in on pure talent.

476
00:45:02,377 --> 00:45:06,245
No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.

477
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:12,208
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!

478
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:21,626
You okay, Ron?

479
00:45:24,633 --> 00:45:26,430
Say something.

480
00:45:32,674 --> 00:45:37,202
-Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
-No, Colin, get out of the way.

481
00:45:38,113 --> 00:45:40,138
Let's take him to Hagrid's.

482
00:45:40,315 --> 00:45:42,442
He'll know what to do.

483
00:45:51,326 --> 00:45:54,693
This calls for
a specialist's equipment.

484
00:45:58,466 --> 00:46:02,061
Nothing to do but wait till it stops,
l'm afraid.

485
00:46:02,704 --> 00:46:05,901
-Okay.
-Better out than in.

486
00:46:06,474 --> 00:46:11,810
-Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
-Malfoy. He called Hermione....

487
00:46:13,014 --> 00:46:16,450
Well, l don't know
exactly what it means.

488
00:46:20,422 --> 00:46:22,617
He called me a Mudblood.

489
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:25,453
-He did not.
-What's a Mudblood?

490
00:46:25,827 --> 00:46:30,355
lt means ''dirty blood.'' Mudblood's a really
foul name for someone who's Muggle-born.

491
00:46:30,532 --> 00:46:34,798
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

492
00:46:35,303 --> 00:46:39,433
lt's not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.

493
00:46:40,575 --> 00:46:45,376
See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family...

494
00:46:45,547 --> 00:46:50,211
...who think they're better than everyone
else because they're pure-blood.

495
00:46:50,385 --> 00:46:52,012
That's horrible.

496
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:56,354
lt's disgusting.

497
00:46:56,524 --> 00:47:00,016
And it's codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.

498
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:03,562
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today
that's not half-blood or less.

499
00:47:03,732 --> 00:47:08,294
More to the point, they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

500
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:10,665
Come here.

501
00:47:11,773 --> 00:47:18,235
Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.

502
00:47:26,021 --> 00:47:29,047
Harry, Harry, Harry.

503
00:47:29,224 --> 00:47:31,454
Can you possibly imagine...

504
00:47:31,626 --> 00:47:34,857
...a better way to serve detention...

505
00:47:35,497 --> 00:47:38,193
...than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?

506
00:47:38,366 --> 00:47:39,765
Not really.

507
00:47:39,934 --> 00:47:46,305
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.

508
00:47:46,474 --> 00:47:48,408
Remember that.

509
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,341
Come.

510
00:47:54,516 --> 00:47:56,609
Come...

511
00:47:57,886 --> 00:48:00,753
...to me.

512
00:48:03,859 --> 00:48:06,384
-What?
-Sorry?

513
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:10,598
That voice.

514
00:48:10,765 --> 00:48:12,289
Voice?

515
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:20,501
-Didn't you hear it?
-What are you talking about, Harry?

516
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:24,704
l think you're getting
a bit drowsy.

517
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,941
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.

518
00:48:29,251 --> 00:48:32,618
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.

519
00:48:37,592 --> 00:48:40,117
Spooky.

520
00:48:43,164 --> 00:48:45,291
Blood.

521
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:48,994
l smell blood.

522
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:52,264
Let me rip you.

523
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,035
Let me kill you.

524
00:48:57,846 --> 00:48:59,313
Kill!

525
00:49:00,248 --> 00:49:01,579
Kill!

526
00:49:02,284 --> 00:49:04,218
-Kill!
-Harry!

527
00:49:04,386 --> 00:49:06,854
-Did you hear it?
-Hear what?

528
00:49:07,022 --> 00:49:10,458
-That voice.
-Voice? What voice?

529
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:14,584
l heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just--

530
00:49:14,863 --> 00:49:16,956
lt's time.

531
00:49:17,132 --> 00:49:20,329
lt's moving.
l think it's going to kill.

532
00:49:21,303 --> 00:49:25,262
-Kill?
-Harry, wait! Not so fast!

533
00:49:50,832 --> 00:49:52,891
Strange.

534
00:49:53,435 --> 00:49:57,929
-l've never seen spiders act like that.
-l don't like spiders.

535
00:50:02,043 --> 00:50:04,102
What's that?

536
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:12,077
''The Chamber of Secrets has been
opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware.''

537
00:50:12,253 --> 00:50:14,517
lt's written in blood.

538
00:50:17,459 --> 00:50:19,620
Oh, no.

539
00:50:24,332 --> 00:50:26,596
lt's Filch's cat.

540
00:50:27,135 --> 00:50:29,399
lt's Mrs. Norris.

541
00:50:45,487 --> 00:50:48,183
''Enemies of the Heir, beware.''

542
00:50:49,691 --> 00:50:52,057
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

543
00:50:52,227 --> 00:50:57,392
What's going on here?
Go on. Make way, make way.

544
00:50:58,867 --> 00:51:00,698
Potter?

545
00:51:00,869 --> 00:51:02,996
What are you...?

546
00:51:06,307 --> 00:51:08,605
Mrs. Norris?

547
00:51:10,111 --> 00:51:14,275
-You've murdered my cat.
-No. No.

548
00:51:14,683 --> 00:51:15,945
l'll kill you.

549
00:51:18,286 --> 00:51:21,119
-l'll kill you!
-Argus!

550
00:51:22,524 --> 00:51:24,651
Argus, l....

551
00:51:26,661 --> 00:51:31,291
Everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately.

552
00:51:32,033 --> 00:51:34,001
Everyone except...

553
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:36,998
...you three.

554
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,904
Ravenclaws, follow me.

555
00:51:43,778 --> 00:51:47,646
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.

556
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:50,649
Thought so.
So unlucky l wasn't there.

557
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:54,016
l know exactly the countercurse
that could've spared her.

558
00:51:56,357 --> 00:51:58,985
But how she has been Petrified,
l cannot say.

559
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:01,956
Ask him.
lt's him that's done it.

560
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:04,826
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

561
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:09,095
lt's not true, sir. l swear.
l never touched Mrs. Norris.

562
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:13,707
-Rubbish.
-lf l might, headmaster?

563
00:52:14,175 --> 00:52:18,976
Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

564
00:52:19,481 --> 00:52:21,381
However...

565
00:52:21,716 --> 00:52:24,685
...the circumstances are suspicious.

566
00:52:24,853 --> 00:52:29,483
l, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.

567
00:52:29,657 --> 00:52:31,921
l'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.

568
00:52:32,093 --> 00:52:35,494
You see, Harry was helping me
answer my fan mail.

569
00:52:35,663 --> 00:52:38,962
That's why Ron and l
went looking for him, professor.

570
00:52:39,134 --> 00:52:41,864
We'd just found him when he said....

571
00:52:44,139 --> 00:52:47,973
-Yes, Miss Granger?
-When l said l wasn't hungry.

572
00:52:49,344 --> 00:52:53,337
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.

573
00:52:55,683 --> 00:53:01,212
-lnnocent until proven guilty, Severus.
-My cat has been Petrified.

574
00:53:02,056 --> 00:53:07,892
-l want to see some punishment!
-We will be able to cure her, Argus.

575
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:13,597
As l understand it, Madam Sprout
has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

576
00:53:13,768 --> 00:53:18,205
When matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris.

577
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,235
And in the meantime...

578
00:53:20,809 --> 00:53:24,802
...l strongly recommend caution...

579
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,448
...to all.

580
00:53:38,493 --> 00:53:41,929
-lt's a bit strange, isn't it?
-Strange?

581
00:53:42,096 --> 00:53:44,860
You hear this voice,
a voice only you can hear...

582
00:53:45,033 --> 00:53:49,732
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. lt's just strange.

583
00:53:49,904 --> 00:53:53,135
Do you think l should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, l mean?

584
00:53:53,308 --> 00:53:54,775
Are you mad?

585
00:53:54,943 --> 00:54:00,438
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
hearing voices isn't a good sign.

586
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:04,916
She's right, you know.

587
00:54:09,257 --> 00:54:11,589
Could l have your attention,
please?

588
00:54:12,126 --> 00:54:17,621
Right. Now, today,
we will be transforming animals...

589
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:20,165
...into water goblets.

590
00:54:21,102 --> 00:54:22,763
Like so.

591
00:54:22,937 --> 00:54:27,840
One, two, three.
Vera Verto.

592
00:54:31,412 --> 00:54:35,314
Now it's your turn.
Who would like to go first?

593
00:54:35,917 --> 00:54:40,877
Mr. Weasley.
''One, two, three. Vera Verto.''

594
00:54:44,459 --> 00:54:46,552
Vera Verto!

595
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:55,329
That wand needs replacing,
Mr. Weasley.

596
00:54:56,671 --> 00:54:58,832
-Yes, Miss Granger?
-Professor...

597
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:03,205
...l was wondering if you could tell us
about the Chamber of Secrets.

598
00:55:09,384 --> 00:55:10,646
Very well.

599
00:55:12,153 --> 00:55:14,144
You all know, of course...

600
00:55:14,322 --> 00:55:18,190
...that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago...

601
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:22,796
...by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:

602
00:55:22,964 --> 00:55:26,695
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...

603
00:55:26,868 --> 00:55:32,500
...Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.

604
00:55:33,174 --> 00:55:39,170
Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.

605
00:55:39,347 --> 00:55:42,373
-One did not.
-Three guesses who.

606
00:55:43,117 --> 00:55:45,551
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective...

607
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,883
...about the students admitted
to Hogwarts.

608
00:55:49,057 --> 00:55:53,653
He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.

609
00:55:53,828 --> 00:55:55,921
ln other words, pure-bloods.

610
00:55:56,331 --> 00:56:01,667
Unable to sway the others,
he decided to leave the school.

611
00:56:02,503 --> 00:56:04,733
Now, according to legend...

612
00:56:04,906 --> 00:56:08,637
...Slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle...

613
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:12,439
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.

614
00:56:12,613 --> 00:56:17,050
Though, shortly before departing,
he sealed it...

615
00:56:17,218 --> 00:56:21,348
...until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.

616
00:56:21,522 --> 00:56:23,888
The Heir alone...

617
00:56:24,058 --> 00:56:26,720
...would be able to open the Chamber...

618
00:56:26,894 --> 00:56:31,661
...and unleash the horror within,
and by so doing...

619
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:35,200
...purge the school
of all those who...

620
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:40,364
...in Slytherin's view,
were unworthy to study magic.

621
00:56:40,975 --> 00:56:43,102
Muggle-borns.

622
00:56:44,178 --> 00:56:47,773
Naturally, the school
has been searched many times.

623
00:56:47,949 --> 00:56:51,407
No such chamber has been found.

624
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:56,650
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?

625
00:56:57,492 --> 00:57:00,086
The Chamber is said to be home
to something...

626
00:57:00,261 --> 00:57:03,822
...that only the Heir of Slytherin
can control.

627
00:57:04,465 --> 00:57:08,094
lt is said to be the home...

628
00:57:08,269 --> 00:57:09,896
...of a monster.

629
00:57:15,643 --> 00:57:19,306
Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

630
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,678
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.

631
00:57:23,851 --> 00:57:27,719
lf there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it really has been opened, that means--

632
00:57:27,889 --> 00:57:31,825
The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

633
00:57:31,993 --> 00:57:36,362
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

634
00:57:36,531 --> 00:57:39,193
-lf you're talking about Malfoy--
-Of course. You heard him.

635
00:57:39,367 --> 00:57:41,096
''You'll be next, Mudbloods.''

636
00:57:41,269 --> 00:57:43,863
l heard him.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?

637
00:57:44,038 --> 00:57:47,201
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
l mean, look at his family.

638
00:57:47,375 --> 00:57:50,173
The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.

639
00:57:50,344 --> 00:57:53,780
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.

640
00:57:54,215 --> 00:57:58,379
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.

641
00:57:58,553 --> 00:58:00,418
Mind you, it would be difficult.

642
00:58:00,588 --> 00:58:03,614
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules...

643
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:08,251
...and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.

644
00:58:15,069 --> 00:58:17,537
Here it is.
The Polyjuice Potion.

645
00:58:17,705 --> 00:58:20,435
''Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion
allows the drinker...

646
00:58:20,608 --> 00:58:24,840
...to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another.''

647
00:58:25,012 --> 00:58:28,812
You mean if Harry and l drink that stuff,
we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

648
00:58:28,983 --> 00:58:32,350
-Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
-Exactly.

649
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:36,388
But it's tricky. l've never seen
a more complicated potion.

650
00:58:36,557 --> 00:58:39,651
-How long will it take to make?
-A month.

651
00:58:40,027 --> 00:58:41,494
A month?

652
00:58:41,662 --> 00:58:45,496
But, Hermione,
if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...

653
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:48,863
...he could attack half
the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

654
00:58:49,036 --> 00:58:50,936
l know.

655
00:58:51,105 --> 00:58:53,938
But it's the only plan we've got.

656
00:59:43,624 --> 00:59:46,320
Another goal for Slytherin!

657
00:59:47,662 --> 00:59:51,063
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.

658
00:59:52,233 --> 00:59:53,791
Yeah!

659
00:59:54,068 --> 00:59:55,831
Yeah!

660
01:00:20,094 --> 01:00:22,426
All right there, Scarhead?

661
01:00:28,536 --> 01:00:31,027
Watch yourself, Harry!

662
01:00:31,439 --> 01:00:33,202
Wood, look out!

663
01:00:46,887 --> 01:00:49,720
Blimey! Harry's got himself
a rogue Bludger.

664
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:51,653
That's been tampered with, that has.

665
01:00:52,693 --> 01:00:53,682
l'll stop it.

666
01:00:53,861 --> 01:00:58,491
No! Even with a proper wand,
it's too risky. You could hit Harry.

667
01:01:43,307 --> 01:01:45,901
Training for the ballet, Potter?

668
01:02:16,874 --> 01:02:19,104
You'll never catch me, Potter.

669
01:03:49,901 --> 01:03:50,959
Let's go.

670
01:03:51,135 --> 01:03:56,368
Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.
Gryffindor wins!

671
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,705
Finite lncantatem!

672
01:04:11,789 --> 01:04:13,120
-Thank you.
-Are you okay?

673
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:15,384
No. l think my arm is broken.

674
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,360
Not to worry, Harry. l will fix
that arm of yours straightaway.

675
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:22,465
-Not you.
-Boy doesn't know what he's saying.

676
01:04:22,633 --> 01:04:26,160
This won't hurt a bit.

677
01:04:32,276 --> 01:04:35,268
Brackium Emendo!

678
01:04:43,321 --> 01:04:46,415
Yes, well,
that can sometimes happen...

679
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,821
...but the point is...

680
01:04:50,228 --> 01:04:54,324
...you can no longer feel any pain, and,
very clearly, the bones are not broken.

681
01:04:54,498 --> 01:04:57,160
Broken? There's no bones left.

682
01:04:58,869 --> 01:05:00,837
Much more flexible, though.

683
01:05:03,307 --> 01:05:07,243
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.
You can go. Out of my way.

684
01:05:07,411 --> 01:05:09,345
Should have been brought
straight to me.

685
01:05:09,513 --> 01:05:12,038
l can mend bones in a heartbeat,
but growing them back....

686
01:05:12,216 --> 01:05:13,706
You will be able to, won't you?

687
01:05:13,884 --> 01:05:17,012
l'll be able to, certainly.
But it'll be painful.

688
01:05:17,655 --> 01:05:22,319
You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

689
01:05:25,229 --> 01:05:28,221
What do you expect?
Pumpkin juice?

690
01:05:34,872 --> 01:05:36,635
Kill.

691
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:38,999
Kill.

692
01:05:44,382 --> 01:05:47,613
Time to kill.

693
01:05:53,758 --> 01:05:54,747
Hello.

694
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,584
Dobby?

695
01:05:57,762 --> 01:06:00,094
Harry Potter should have listened
to Dobby.

696
01:06:00,564 --> 01:06:04,295
Harry Potter should have gone back home
when he missed the train.

697
01:06:04,468 --> 01:06:09,064
lt was you. You stopped the barrier
from letting Ron and me through.

698
01:06:09,373 --> 01:06:12,342
lndeed. Yes, sir.

699
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:18,372
-You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
-At least you would be away from here.

700
01:06:18,549 --> 01:06:21,211
Harry Potter must go home.

701
01:06:21,385 --> 01:06:24,980
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see--

702
01:06:25,156 --> 01:06:28,523
Your Bludger? You made
that Bludger chase after me?

703
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:32,254
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.

704
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:36,059
Dobby had to iron his hands.

705
01:06:38,269 --> 01:06:42,865
You better clear off before my bones
come back, Dobby, or l might strangle you.

706
01:06:45,509 --> 01:06:50,708
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.
Dobby gets them five times a day at home.

707
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:53,645
l don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?

708
01:06:53,951 --> 01:06:57,819
Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.

709
01:06:57,988 --> 01:07:01,355
Dobby remembers how it was
before Harry Potter triumphed...

710
01:07:01,525 --> 01:07:04,619
...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

711
01:07:04,795 --> 01:07:08,492
We house-elves were
treated like vermin, sir.

712
01:07:08,666 --> 01:07:14,104
Of course, Dobby is still
treated like vermin.

713
01:07:23,447 --> 01:07:26,075
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

714
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:31,381
This, sir? lt is a mark
of the house-elf's enslavement.

715
01:07:31,555 --> 01:07:36,652
Dobby can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes.

716
01:07:38,796 --> 01:07:40,161
Listen.

717
01:07:40,331 --> 01:07:41,855
Listen!

718
01:07:42,032 --> 01:07:45,763
Terrible things are
about to happen at Hogwarts.

719
01:07:46,404 --> 01:07:48,838
Harry Potter must not stay here...

720
01:07:49,006 --> 01:07:53,534
...now that history
is to repeat itself.

721
01:07:53,711 --> 01:07:57,169
Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?

722
01:07:57,348 --> 01:07:59,339
l shouldn't have said that.

723
01:08:03,087 --> 01:08:06,215
-Bad Dobby! Bad!
-Stop it!

724
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:08,085
Stop it, Dobby!

725
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:13,560
Tell me. When did this happen before?
Who's doing it now?

726
01:08:13,531 --> 01:08:18,764
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby
only wants Harry Potter to be safe.

727
01:08:18,936 --> 01:08:21,837
No, Dobby. Tell me.
Who is it?

728
01:08:33,684 --> 01:08:34,776
Put him here.

729
01:08:39,357 --> 01:08:42,292
-What happened?
-There's been another attack.

730
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:48,262
l think he's been Petrified,
Madam Pomfrey.

731
01:08:49,033 --> 01:08:53,732
Look. Perhaps he managed
to take a picture of his attacker.

732
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:04,610
What can this mean, Albus?

733
01:09:04,782 --> 01:09:06,716
lt means...

734
01:09:07,084 --> 01:09:09,848
...that our students
are in great danger.

735
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:13,422
-What should l tell the staff?
-The truth.

736
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:17,491
Tell them Hogwarts
is no longer safe.

737
01:09:17,828 --> 01:09:20,763
lt is as we feared, Minerva.

738
01:09:20,998 --> 01:09:25,560
The Chamber of Secrets
has indeed been opened again.

739
01:09:28,406 --> 01:09:32,536
Again? You mean the Chamber
of Secrets has been opened before?

740
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,440
Of course.
Don't you see?

741
01:09:35,613 --> 01:09:38,639
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it
when he was at school here.

742
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:41,844
-Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
-Maybe.

743
01:09:42,019 --> 01:09:45,182
We'll have to wait for
the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

744
01:09:45,356 --> 01:09:49,292
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight...

745
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:53,419
...in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?

746
01:09:54,332 --> 01:09:56,994
No. No one ever comes in here.

747
01:09:57,835 --> 01:10:00,360
-Why?
-Moaning Myrtle.

748
01:10:00,538 --> 01:10:02,506
Who?

749
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,736
Moaning Myrtle.

750
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:08,310
-Who's Moaning Myrtle?
-l'm Moaning Myrtle.

751
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:16,617
l wouldn't expect you to know me.

752
01:10:16,787 --> 01:10:19,813
Who would ever talk
about ugly, miserable...

753
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:23,391
...moping Moaning Myrtle?

754
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:32,728
She's a little sensitive.

755
01:10:37,241 --> 01:10:39,175
Gather round!

756
01:10:39,543 --> 01:10:44,503
Gather round.
Can everybody see me?

757
01:10:44,682 --> 01:10:47,810
Can you all hear me?

758
01:10:48,486 --> 01:10:49,817
Excellent.

759
01:10:50,321 --> 01:10:54,018
ln light of the dark events
of recent weeks...

760
01:10:54,191 --> 01:10:58,890
...Professor Dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this Dueling Club...

761
01:10:59,063 --> 01:11:03,693
...to train you all up in case
you ever need to defend yourselves...

762
01:11:03,868 --> 01:11:06,428
...as l myself have done
on countless occasions.

763
01:11:06,604 --> 01:11:10,267
For full details,
see my published works.

764
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:18,500
That Lockhart's something, isn't he?
Awfully brave chap.

765
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:21,860
-Justin Finch-Fletchley. Hufflepuff.
-Nice to meet you. l'm--

766
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:25,420
l know who you are. We all do.
Even us Muggle-borns.

767
01:11:25,579 --> 01:11:28,607
Let me introduce my assistant...

768
01:11:28,832 --> 01:11:31,160
...Professor Snape.

769
01:11:34,505 --> 01:11:37,269
He has sportingly agreed to help
with a short demonstration.

770
01:11:37,441 --> 01:11:39,466
l don't want any of you
youngsters to worry.

771
01:11:39,643 --> 01:11:44,603
You'll still have your Potions master
when l'm through with him. Never fear.

772
01:12:00,264 --> 01:12:01,253
One.

773
01:12:02,099 --> 01:12:03,088
Two.

774
01:12:03,901 --> 01:12:06,927
-Three!
-Expelliarmus!

775
01:12:15,512 --> 01:12:18,174
-Do you think he's all right?
-Who cares?

776
01:12:18,348 --> 01:12:21,317
An excellent idea to show them that,
Professor Snape...

777
01:12:21,485 --> 01:12:26,047
...but if you don't mind me saying, it was
pretty obvious what you were about to do.

778
01:12:26,223 --> 01:12:29,454
lf l had wanted to stop you,
it would have been only too easy.

779
01:12:29,626 --> 01:12:33,084
Perhaps it would be prudent
to first teach the students...

780
01:12:33,263 --> 01:12:37,757
...to block unfriendly spells,
professor.

781
01:12:39,503 --> 01:12:41,937
An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.

782
01:12:43,173 --> 01:12:47,439
Let's have a volunteer pair.
Potter, Weasley, how about you?

783
01:12:47,611 --> 01:12:51,103
Weasley's wand causes devastation
with the simplest spells.

784
01:12:51,515 --> 01:12:55,246
We'll be sending Potter
to the hospital wing in a matchbox.

785
01:12:55,419 --> 01:12:59,480
Might l suggest someone
from my own house?

786
01:13:00,758 --> 01:13:03,226
Malfoy, perhaps?

787
01:13:10,768 --> 01:13:13,236
-Good luck, Potter.
-Thank you, sir.

788
01:13:21,211 --> 01:13:23,202
Wands at the ready.

789
01:13:23,814 --> 01:13:26,806
-Scared, Potter?
-You wish.

790
01:13:37,227 --> 01:13:38,956
On the count of three...

791
01:13:39,129 --> 01:13:43,463
...cast your charms to disarm
your opponent. Only to disarm.

792
01:13:43,634 --> 01:13:47,161
We don't want any accidents here.
One.

793
01:13:48,939 --> 01:13:51,499
-Two.
-Everte Statum!

794
01:14:03,153 --> 01:14:05,383
Rictusempra!

795
01:14:16,366 --> 01:14:18,163
l said disarm only.

796
01:14:18,335 --> 01:14:20,303
Serpensortia!

797
01:14:28,979 --> 01:14:31,777
Don't move, Potter.
l'll get rid of it for you.

798
01:14:31,949 --> 01:14:37,387
Allow me, Professor Snape.
Alarte Ascendare!

799
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:22,592
Vipera Evanesca.

800
01:15:29,306 --> 01:15:31,672
What are you playing at?

801
01:15:44,454 --> 01:15:47,150
You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?

802
01:15:47,324 --> 01:15:49,588
-l'm a what?
-You can talk to snakes.

803
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:55,062
l know. l accidentally set a python
on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.

804
01:15:55,232 --> 01:15:59,191
Once. But so what?
l bet loads of people here can do it.

805
01:15:59,369 --> 01:16:03,135
No, they can't.
lt's not a very common gift, Harry.

806
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,335
This is bad.

807
01:16:05,509 --> 01:16:09,240
What's bad? lf l hadn't told
that snake not to attack Justin--

808
01:16:09,413 --> 01:16:12,905
-That's what you said to it.
-You were there. You heard me.

809
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:16,985
l heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.

810
01:16:17,154 --> 01:16:20,021
l spoke a different language?

811
01:16:21,091 --> 01:16:23,491
But l didn't realize--

812
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:26,424
How can l speak a language
without knowing l can?

813
01:16:26,596 --> 01:16:30,623
l don't know, but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something.

814
01:16:30,801 --> 01:16:32,496
Harry, listen to me.

815
01:16:32,903 --> 01:16:35,770
There's a reason the symbol
of Slytherin house is a serpent.

816
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:40,467
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could talk to snakes too.

817
01:16:40,711 --> 01:16:41,735
Exactly.

818
01:16:41,912 --> 01:16:45,279
Now the whole school's gonna think
you're his great-great-great grandson.

819
01:16:45,449 --> 01:16:47,440
But l'm not.

820
01:16:50,187 --> 01:16:52,121
l can't be.

821
01:16:53,256 --> 01:16:55,281
He lived a thousand years ago.

822
01:16:55,459 --> 01:16:58,690
For all we know, you could be.

823
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:15,150
Who am l, Hedwig?

824
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:17,910
What am l?

825
01:17:53,592 --> 01:17:55,958
l'll see you back in the common room.

826
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:13,920
So anyway, l told Justin to hide up
in our dormitory.

827
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:18,280
l mean to say, if Potter's
marked him down as his next victim...

828
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:21,240
...it's best he keeps
a low profile for a while.

829
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,040
But why would he want to attack Justin?

830
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:29,120
Well, Justin let it slip to Potter
that he was Muggle-born.

831
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,960
And you definitely think Potter's
the Heir of Slytherin?

832
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:36,480
Hannah, he's a Parselmouth.

833
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:39,440
Everyone knows that's the mark
of a Dark wizard.

834
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:43,720
Have you ever heard of a decent one
who could talk to snakes?

835
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:47,000
They called Slytherin himself
Serpent-tongue.

836
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,760
Harry always seems so nice, though.

837
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:54,520
And, after all, he is the one
who made You-Know-Who disappear.

838
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:59,000
That's probably why You-Know-Who
wanted to kill him in the first place.

839
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:02,480
Didn't want another Dark Lord
competing with him.

840
01:20:00,435 --> 01:20:04,701
l want blood.

841
01:20:07,609 --> 01:20:12,603
They all must die.

842
01:20:13,181 --> 01:20:15,172
Kill.

843
01:20:15,851 --> 01:20:17,944
Kill.

844
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:21,018
Kill.

845
01:20:21,356 --> 01:20:27,017
Time to kill.

846
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:03,720
Caught in the act.

847
01:21:03,889 --> 01:21:05,857
l'll have you out this time, Potter.

848
01:21:06,358 --> 01:21:08,849
Mark my words.

849
01:21:09,027 --> 01:21:13,259
No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand--

850
01:21:40,025 --> 01:21:41,959
Professor...

851
01:21:42,127 --> 01:21:43,492
...l swear l didn't.

852
01:21:43,662 --> 01:21:46,893
This is out of my hands, Potter.

853
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:59,203
Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.

854
01:22:08,119 --> 01:22:10,713
Sherbet Lemon.

855
01:22:44,656 --> 01:22:46,783
Professor Dumbledore?

856
01:23:03,275 --> 01:23:05,971
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

857
01:23:08,847 --> 01:23:13,375
l was just wondering
if you put me in the right house.

858
01:23:13,551 --> 01:23:19,012
Yes. You were particularly
difficult to place.

859
01:23:19,190 --> 01:23:22,717
But l stand by what l said last year.

860
01:23:22,894 --> 01:23:26,295
You would have done well in Slytherin.

861
01:23:26,464 --> 01:23:27,795
You're wrong.

862
01:23:57,062 --> 01:23:58,495
Harry?

863
01:23:58,863 --> 01:24:01,093
Professor.

864
01:24:01,266 --> 01:24:05,066
Your bird....
There was nothing l could do.

865
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:08,969
-He just caught fire.
-And about time too.

866
01:24:09,841 --> 01:24:12,139
He's been looking dreadful for days.

867
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:14,335
Pity you had to see him
on a burning day.

868
01:24:16,247 --> 01:24:19,478
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.

869
01:24:19,651 --> 01:24:23,018
They burst into flame
when it is time for them to die...

870
01:24:23,188 --> 01:24:25,281
...and then they are...

871
01:24:25,457 --> 01:24:28,483
...reborn from the ashes.

872
01:24:36,901 --> 01:24:39,529
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.

873
01:24:39,971 --> 01:24:43,873
They can carry immensely heavy loads.

874
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:46,875
Their tears have healing powers.

875
01:24:49,481 --> 01:24:52,541
Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Wait! Listen!

876
01:24:53,518 --> 01:24:55,645
Professor Dumbledore, sir,
it wasn't Harry.

877
01:24:56,821 --> 01:24:59,688
l'd be prepared to swear it
in front of the Ministry of Magic.

878
01:25:01,159 --> 01:25:03,059
Relax.

879
01:25:03,795 --> 01:25:05,763
l do not believe...

880
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:09,263
-...that Harry attacked anyone.
-Of course you don't.

881
01:25:13,171 --> 01:25:15,765
Right. Well, l'll....

882
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:19,068
-l'll just wait outside, then.
-Yes.

883
01:25:22,747 --> 01:25:26,410
-You don't think it was me, professor?
-No, Harry.

884
01:25:26,584 --> 01:25:29,075
l do not think it was you.

885
01:25:30,121 --> 01:25:31,918
But l must ask you...

886
01:25:32,490 --> 01:25:36,586
...is there something
you wish to tell me?

887
01:25:43,034 --> 01:25:44,968
No, sir.

888
01:25:45,136 --> 01:25:46,626
Nothing.

889
01:25:49,641 --> 01:25:51,802
Very well, then.

890
01:25:51,976 --> 01:25:53,773
Off you go.

891
01:26:13,092 --> 01:26:15,572
Hey, look, everyone.
lt's the Heir of Slytherin.

892
01:26:15,732 --> 01:26:20,012
Be careful. He's a seriously evil wizard.

893
01:26:21,052 --> 01:26:24,012
Come on, Harry. Fred and George
were just having a laugh.

894
01:26:24,172 --> 01:26:26,332
They're the only ones.

895
01:26:26,492 --> 01:26:30,652
So half the school thinks you nip off
to the Chamber of Secrets every night.

896
01:26:30,812 --> 01:26:31,852
Who cares?

897
01:26:32,572 --> 01:26:33,932
Maybe they're right.

898
01:26:36,012 --> 01:26:39,092
Harry. Harry.

899
01:26:40,532 --> 01:26:44,852
-Come on.
-l didn't know l can speak Parseltongue.

900
01:26:45,532 --> 01:26:48,212
What else don't l know about myself?

901
01:26:49,612 --> 01:26:51,252
Look...

902
01:26:52,612 --> 01:26:55,572
...maybe you can do something...

903
01:26:55,732 --> 01:27:00,212
...even something horrible,
and not know you did it.

904
01:27:00,612 --> 01:27:03,812
You don't believe that, Harry.
l know you don't.

905
01:27:04,772 --> 01:27:08,372
And if it makes you feel any better,
Malfoy's staying for the holidays too.

906
01:27:09,052 --> 01:27:11,332
Why would that make anyone
feel any better?

907
01:27:11,532 --> 01:27:15,892
Because in a few days
the Polyjuice Potion will be ready.

908
01:27:16,052 --> 01:27:21,452
ln a few days, we may truly know
who is the Heir of Slytherin.

909
01:27:46,917 --> 01:27:50,444
Everything's set. We just need a bit
of who you're changing into.

910
01:27:50,621 --> 01:27:52,350
Crabbe and Goyle.

911
01:27:52,523 --> 01:27:55,287
We also need to make sure
that the real Crabbe and Goyle...

912
01:27:55,459 --> 01:27:58,690
...can't burst in on us
while we're interrogating Malfoy.

913
01:27:59,029 --> 01:28:01,725
-How?
-l've got it all worked out.

914
01:28:01,899 --> 01:28:04,459
l filled these
with a simple Sleeping Draught.

915
01:28:04,635 --> 01:28:07,399
Simple, but powerful.

916
01:28:07,638 --> 01:28:09,799
Now, once they're asleep...

917
01:28:09,973 --> 01:28:13,170
...hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs...

918
01:28:13,343 --> 01:28:15,243
...and put on their uniforms.

919
01:28:15,412 --> 01:28:18,677
-Whose hair are you ripping out, then?
-l've already got mine.

920
01:28:18,849 --> 01:28:22,046
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.

921
01:28:22,219 --> 01:28:24,380
l got this off her robes.

922
01:28:24,555 --> 01:28:27,149
l'm going to go check
on the Polyjuice Potion.

923
01:28:27,324 --> 01:28:30,054
Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle
find these.

924
01:28:42,172 --> 01:28:44,538
Ron, maybe l should do it.

925
01:28:44,708 --> 01:28:46,767
Yeah. Right.

926
01:28:48,979 --> 01:28:50,344
Wingardium Leviosa.

927
01:29:00,958 --> 01:29:02,585
Cool.

928
01:29:25,716 --> 01:29:27,547
How thick could you get?

929
01:29:27,718 --> 01:29:29,686
Come on, let's get them.

930
01:29:44,901 --> 01:29:47,061
Well, did you get the hairs?

931
01:29:48,501 --> 01:29:50,221
-What are those?
-Slytherin robes.

932
01:29:50,421 --> 01:29:53,061
l had to sneak them from the laundry.

933
01:29:55,421 --> 01:29:56,941
Are we going to drink that?

934
01:29:58,381 --> 01:30:01,341
We'll have exactly one hour
before we change back into ourselves.

935
01:30:15,035 --> 01:30:17,003
Add the hairs.

936
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:23,270
Essence of Crabbe.

937
01:30:23,443 --> 01:30:25,343
Cheers.

938
01:30:34,054 --> 01:30:36,488
l think l'm gonna be sick.

939
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:41,223
Me too.

940
01:31:26,106 --> 01:31:27,835
Harry?

941
01:31:28,308 --> 01:31:29,866
Ron.

942
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:32,771
Bloody hell!

943
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:35,844
We still sound like ourselves.

944
01:31:36,015 --> 01:31:37,778
You need to sound more like Crabbe.

945
01:31:38,952 --> 01:31:41,250
-Bloody hell.
-Excellent.

946
01:31:41,588 --> 01:31:44,079
-But where's Hermione?
-l....

947
01:31:44,257 --> 01:31:47,249
l don't think l'm going.
You go on without me.

948
01:31:47,427 --> 01:31:49,122
Hermione, are you okay?

949
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:52,128
Just go. You're wasting time.

950
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:55,861
Come on.

951
01:31:59,372 --> 01:32:02,739
l think the Slytherin common room's
this way.

952
01:32:05,712 --> 01:32:08,180
Excuse me.

953
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:11,917
What are you doing d--?

954
01:32:12,085 --> 01:32:14,144
l mean, what are you doing down here?

955
01:32:16,055 --> 01:32:18,785
l happen to be a school prefect.

956
01:32:18,958 --> 01:32:23,418
You, on the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.

957
01:32:23,997 --> 01:32:25,828
What are your names again?

958
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:29,992
-l'm....
-Crabbe, Goyle, where have you two been?

959
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:33,196
Pigging out in the Great Hall
all this time?

960
01:32:34,707 --> 01:32:37,005
Why are you wearing glasses?

961
01:32:37,844 --> 01:32:40,677
-Reading.
-Reading?

962
01:32:41,848 --> 01:32:44,146
l didn't know you could read.

963
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:49,113
And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?

964
01:32:49,289 --> 01:32:51,314
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.

965
01:33:00,099 --> 01:33:02,090
Well, sit down.

966
01:33:04,904 --> 01:33:08,738
You'd never know the Weasleys
were pure-bloods, the way they behave.

967
01:33:08,975 --> 01:33:12,809
They're an embarrassment
to the wizarding world. All of them.

968
01:33:13,646 --> 01:33:15,910
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?

969
01:33:18,151 --> 01:33:19,880
Stomachache.

970
01:33:21,888 --> 01:33:26,723
You know, l'm surprised the Daily Prophet
hasn't done a report on all these attacks.

971
01:33:26,893 --> 01:33:29,361
l suppose Dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up.

972
01:33:29,629 --> 01:33:32,029
Father always said Dumbledore
was the worst thing...

973
01:33:32,198 --> 01:33:35,998
-...that ever happened to this place.
-You're wrong!

974
01:33:43,476 --> 01:33:44,670
What?

975
01:33:44,844 --> 01:33:48,507
You think there's someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?

976
01:33:48,681 --> 01:33:51,081
Well? Do you?

977
01:33:51,618 --> 01:33:53,483
Harry Potter?

978
01:34:00,059 --> 01:34:01,458
Good one, Goyle.

979
01:34:01,628 --> 01:34:03,186
You're absolutely right.

980
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:05,695
Saint Potter.

981
01:34:06,699 --> 01:34:09,463
And people actually think
that he's the Heir of Slytherin?

982
01:34:13,239 --> 01:34:15,833
But then you must have some idea
who's behind it all.

983
01:34:16,009 --> 01:34:19,706
You know l don't, Goyle.
l told you yesterday.

984
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:23,205
How many times do l have to tell you?

985
01:34:24,183 --> 01:34:26,048
ls this yours?

986
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:32,890
But my father did say this:

987
01:34:33,259 --> 01:34:36,160
lt's been 50 years
since the Chamber was opened.

988
01:34:36,329 --> 01:34:40,732
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.

989
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:45,664
The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died.

990
01:34:45,838 --> 01:34:50,138
So it's only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.

991
01:34:50,743 --> 01:34:52,574
As for me...

992
01:34:52,745 --> 01:34:54,906
...l hope it's Granger.

993
01:34:55,081 --> 01:34:57,276
What's the matter with you two?

994
01:34:57,450 --> 01:34:59,941
You're acting very odd.

995
01:35:00,119 --> 01:35:02,314
lt's his stomachache.

996
01:35:02,488 --> 01:35:04,547
Calm down.

997
01:35:08,728 --> 01:35:10,719
Scar.

998
01:35:14,334 --> 01:35:15,767
Hair.

999
01:35:21,941 --> 01:35:24,307
Hey! Where are you going?

1000
01:35:46,913 --> 01:35:48,175
That was close.

1001
01:35:48,348 --> 01:35:50,782
Hermione, come out.
We've got loads to tell you.

1002
01:35:50,951 --> 01:35:52,816
Go away.

1003
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:57,222
Wait till you see. lt's awful.

1004
01:35:59,159 --> 01:36:00,922
Hermione?

1005
01:36:01,094 --> 01:36:02,721
Are you okay?

1006
01:36:04,764 --> 01:36:06,527
Do you remember me telling you...

1007
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:09,863
...that the Polyjuice Potion
was only for human transformations?

1008
01:36:10,036 --> 01:36:14,166
lt was cat hair l plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.

1009
01:36:16,543 --> 01:36:18,101
Look at my face.

1010
01:36:19,245 --> 01:36:21,679
Look at your tail.

1011
01:36:28,254 --> 01:36:29,687
Have you spoken to Hermione?

1012
01:36:29,856 --> 01:36:32,416
She should be out of hospital
in a few days...

1013
01:36:32,592 --> 01:36:35,390
...when she stops coughing up fur balls.

1014
01:36:40,166 --> 01:36:41,929
What's this?

1015
01:36:46,506 --> 01:36:47,564
Yuck!

1016
01:36:47,741 --> 01:36:50,539
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's
flooded the bathroom.

1017
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:10,890
-Come to throw something else at me?
-Why would l throw something at you?

1018
01:37:11,331 --> 01:37:15,392
Don't ask me. Here l am,
minding my own business...

1019
01:37:15,568 --> 01:37:19,197
...and someone thinks it's funny
to throw a book at me.

1020
01:37:19,406 --> 01:37:22,307
But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you.

1021
01:37:22,475 --> 01:37:24,875
l mean, it'll just go
right through you.

1022
01:37:25,912 --> 01:37:30,315
Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle
because she can't feel it.

1023
01:37:30,483 --> 01:37:33,077
Ten points
if you get it through her stomach!

1024
01:37:33,253 --> 01:37:36,745
Fifty points if it goes through her head!

1025
01:37:37,257 --> 01:37:41,694
-But who threw it at you, anyway?
-l don't know. l didn't see them.

1026
01:37:42,028 --> 01:37:46,260
l was just sitting in the U-bend,
thinking about death...

1027
01:37:46,466 --> 01:37:50,163
...and it fell through the top
of my head.

1028
01:38:09,181 --> 01:38:11,301
There's a name in this diary.

1029
01:38:11,461 --> 01:38:15,901
Tom Marvolo Riddle.

1030
01:38:16,061 --> 01:38:17,941
Tom Marvolo Riddle?

1031
01:38:19,621 --> 01:38:24,941
Hang on. l know that name.
Why do l know that name?

1032
01:38:25,421 --> 01:38:28,501
Of course. That night l had detention.

1033
01:38:28,661 --> 01:38:31,821
My job was to polish the silver
in the trophy room.

1034
01:38:31,981 --> 01:38:36,901
l remember because l kept burping up
slugs over Tom Riddle's trophy.

1035
01:38:37,701 --> 01:38:41,421
-What was the trophy for?
-He won an award. 50 years ago.

1036
01:38:41,581 --> 01:38:44,181
Special services to the
school or something.

1037
01:38:44,341 --> 01:38:47,501
-50 years ago. Are you sure?
-Yeah. Why?

1038
01:38:48,141 --> 01:38:50,141
Don't you remember
what Malfoy told you?

1039
01:38:50,301 --> 01:38:51,781
The last time
the Chamber was opened was--

1040
01:38:51,941 --> 01:38:53,941
Fifty years ago.
But that means--

1041
01:38:54,101 --> 01:38:57,621
Tom Riddle was here at Hogwarts
when it happened.

1042
01:38:57,821 --> 01:39:00,341
What if he wrote about what he saw?

1043
01:39:00,661 --> 01:39:02,581
lt's possible he knew
where the Chamber was...

1044
01:39:03,141 --> 01:39:07,021
...how to open it, even what sort
of creature lives in it.

1045
01:39:07,901 --> 01:39:12,701
lf so, whoever's behind these attacks
wouldn't want this diary lying around...

1046
01:39:12,861 --> 01:39:13,901
...would they?

1047
01:39:14,301 --> 01:39:18,261
That's a brilliant theory, Hermione,
but there's just one flaw.

1048
01:39:18,981 --> 01:39:21,701
There's nothing written in this diary.

1049
01:39:41,336 --> 01:39:43,136
Do you mind?

1050
01:39:51,047 --> 01:39:53,538
''Tom Marvolo Riddle.''

1051
01:40:22,975 --> 01:40:25,307
My name...

1052
01:40:25,478 --> 01:40:28,413
...is Harry...

1053
01:40:30,016 --> 01:40:32,143
...Potter.

1054
01:40:45,398 --> 01:40:50,563
Do you know anything...

1055
01:40:51,370 --> 01:40:58,071
...about the Chamber of Secrets?

1056
01:41:08,187 --> 01:41:10,121
Can you...

1057
01:41:11,357 --> 01:41:13,655
...tell me?

1058
01:42:15,922 --> 01:42:19,358
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what's going on here?

1059
01:42:22,795 --> 01:42:25,127
Are you Tom Riddle?

1060
01:42:25,298 --> 01:42:27,095
Hello, can you hear me?

1061
01:42:47,687 --> 01:42:49,416
Riddle!

1062
01:42:50,022 --> 01:42:51,546
Come.

1063
01:42:51,724 --> 01:42:53,715
Professor Dumbledore.

1064
01:42:55,895 --> 01:42:58,056
Dumbledore?

1065
01:42:59,365 --> 01:43:02,823
lt is not wise to be wandering around
this late hour, Tom.

1066
01:43:03,002 --> 01:43:06,335
Yes, professor. l suppose l....

1067
01:43:06,505 --> 01:43:08,700
l had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.

1068
01:43:09,275 --> 01:43:12,176
l'm afraid they are, Tom.
They are true.

1069
01:43:12,345 --> 01:43:15,212
About the school as well?
l don't have a home to go to.

1070
01:43:15,381 --> 01:43:18,214
They wouldn't really close Hogwarts,
would they, professor?

1071
01:43:18,384 --> 01:43:20,909
l understand, Tom, but l'm afraid...

1072
01:43:21,687 --> 01:43:24,622
...Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.

1073
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:29,284
Sir, if it all stopped,
if the person responsible was caught....

1074
01:43:31,564 --> 01:43:33,657
ls there something...

1075
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:36,591
...you wish to tell me?

1076
01:43:37,803 --> 01:43:40,328
No, sir. Nothing.

1077
01:43:47,113 --> 01:43:50,139
Very well, then. Off you go.

1078
01:43:50,316 --> 01:43:52,181
Good night, sir.

1079
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:31,221
-Let's get you out of there.
-Evening, Hagrid.

1080
01:44:31,557 --> 01:44:35,891
l'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid.
l don't think you meant it to kill anyone....

1081
01:44:36,062 --> 01:44:38,360
You can't. You don't understand.

1082
01:44:38,531 --> 01:44:41,659
The dead girl's parents will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...

1083
01:44:41,834 --> 01:44:44,735
...is make sure the thing that killed
their daughter is slaughtered.

1084
01:44:45,004 --> 01:44:48,132
lt wasn't him.
Aragog never killed no one. Never.

1085
01:44:48,441 --> 01:44:50,602
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.

1086
01:44:50,776 --> 01:44:52,403
-Now, stand aside.
-No!

1087
01:44:52,578 --> 01:44:54,546
-Stand aside, Hagrid.
-No!

1088
01:44:54,714 --> 01:44:56,341
Cistem Aperio!

1089
01:45:03,289 --> 01:45:05,655
Arania Exumai!

1090
01:45:06,525 --> 01:45:07,992
Aragog!

1091
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:09,388
Aragog!

1092
01:45:09,929 --> 01:45:11,328
l can't let you go.

1093
01:45:11,864 --> 01:45:15,163
They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
You'll be expelled.

1094
01:45:17,703 --> 01:45:19,568
Hagrid!

1095
01:45:48,011 --> 01:45:51,171
Ron. Ron, wake up.

1096
01:45:53,091 --> 01:45:54,491
What happened?

1097
01:45:54,651 --> 01:45:58,651
lt was Hagrid. Hagrid opened
the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.

1098
01:46:13,656 --> 01:46:16,625
lt can't be Hagrid.
lt just can't be.

1099
01:46:16,792 --> 01:46:20,853
We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me.

1100
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:24,522
The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
What would any of us have done?

1101
01:46:24,834 --> 01:46:28,793
Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't
we just go and ask him about it?

1102
01:46:29,005 --> 01:46:31,667
That would be a cheerful visit.
''Hello, Hagrid.

1103
01:46:31,841 --> 01:46:35,675
Tell us, have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?''

1104
01:46:35,845 --> 01:46:39,042
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking
about me, now, would you?

1105
01:46:39,382 --> 01:46:40,371
No.

1106
01:46:44,887 --> 01:46:46,514
What's that you've got, Hagrid?

1107
01:46:46,956 --> 01:46:51,518
lt's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.

1108
01:46:51,694 --> 01:46:55,357
Now, according to Professor Sprout,
they've still got a bit of growing up to do.

1109
01:46:55,531 --> 01:46:59,023
But once their acne's cleared up, we'll
be able to chop them up and stew them...

1110
01:46:59,201 --> 01:47:02,500
...and then we'll get those people
down at the hospital un-Petrified.

1111
01:47:03,940 --> 01:47:06,841
ln the meantime, though, you three...

1112
01:47:07,009 --> 01:47:10,172
...had best be looking after yourselves.
All right?

1113
01:47:18,054 --> 01:47:19,954
Hello, Neville.

1114
01:47:21,057 --> 01:47:23,548
Harry, l don't know who did it,
but you'd better come.

1115
01:47:23,926 --> 01:47:25,621
Come on!

1116
01:47:48,184 --> 01:47:52,211
lt had to be a Gryffindor.
Nobody else knows our password.

1117
01:47:52,388 --> 01:47:54,618
Unless it wasn't a student.

1118
01:47:54,790 --> 01:47:58,226
Whoever it was, they must have
been looking for something.

1119
01:47:58,394 --> 01:47:59,793
And they found it.

1120
01:48:00,529 --> 01:48:03,054
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.

1121
01:48:04,093 --> 01:48:05,390
All right, listen up.

1122
01:48:05,561 --> 01:48:08,462
We play our game,
Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.

1123
01:48:08,630 --> 01:48:10,495
We're stronger, quicker and smarter.

1124
01:48:10,666 --> 01:48:13,692
Not to mention they're dead scared
that Harry will Petrify them...

1125
01:48:13,869 --> 01:48:17,327
-...if they fly anywhere near him.
-Well, that too.

1126
01:48:18,574 --> 01:48:20,098
Professor McGonagall.

1127
01:48:20,275 --> 01:48:23,301
-This match has been canceled.
-We can't cancel Quidditch.

1128
01:48:23,479 --> 01:48:28,439
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates
will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.

1129
01:48:28,617 --> 01:48:31,279
Potter, you and l will find Mr. Weasley.

1130
01:48:31,653 --> 01:48:34,178
There's something
the both of you have to see.

1131
01:48:36,291 --> 01:48:39,886
l warn you.
This could be a wee bit of a shock.

1132
01:48:48,270 --> 01:48:49,464
Hermione!

1133
01:48:49,638 --> 01:48:51,435
She was found near the library...

1134
01:48:52,674 --> 01:48:54,733
...along with this.

1135
01:48:56,178 --> 01:48:59,011
Does it mean anything to either of you?

1136
01:48:59,181 --> 01:49:00,648
No.

1137
01:49:14,863 --> 01:49:17,195
Could l have your attention, please?

1138
01:49:17,366 --> 01:49:22,998
Because of recent events, these new rules
will be put into effect immediately:

1139
01:49:23,338 --> 01:49:28,469
''All students will return to their house
common rooms by 6:00 every evening.

1140
01:49:28,644 --> 01:49:32,705
All students will be escorted
to each lesson by a teacher.

1141
01:49:32,881 --> 01:49:35,873
No exceptions.''

1142
01:49:36,552 --> 01:49:38,611
l should tell you this:

1143
01:49:38,787 --> 01:49:42,883
Unless the culprit
behind these attacks is caught...

1144
01:49:43,458 --> 01:49:46,621
...it is likely the school will be closed.

1145
01:49:58,140 --> 01:50:01,075
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
l can't believe it's him...

1146
01:50:01,243 --> 01:50:03,541
...but if he did set the monster loose
last time...

1147
01:50:03,712 --> 01:50:06,875
...he'll know how to get inside
the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.

1148
01:50:07,049 --> 01:50:08,277
But you heard McGonagall.

1149
01:50:08,450 --> 01:50:11,749
We're not allowed to leave
the tower except for class.

1150
01:50:12,221 --> 01:50:14,689
l think it's time to get
my dad's old cloak out again.

1151
01:50:24,190 --> 01:50:25,830
Ready?

1152
01:50:46,303 --> 01:50:48,032
Who's there?

1153
01:50:51,842 --> 01:50:53,400
Hello?

1154
01:50:54,044 --> 01:50:55,568
Hello?

1155
01:50:56,747 --> 01:51:01,047
-What's that for?
-Nothing. l was expecting....

1156
01:51:01,218 --> 01:51:05,086
lt doesn't matter. Come on in.
l just made a pot of tea.

1157
01:51:07,825 --> 01:51:10,123
Hagrid, are you okay?

1158
01:51:10,294 --> 01:51:13,195
l'm fine. l'm all right.

1159
01:51:14,131 --> 01:51:15,860
Did you hear about Hermione?

1160
01:51:16,367 --> 01:51:19,996
Yeah. l heard about that, all right.

1161
01:51:20,371 --> 01:51:24,000
Look, we have to ask you something.

1162
01:51:25,709 --> 01:51:29,201
Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?

1163
01:51:31,515 --> 01:51:33,813
What you had to understand
about that is--

1164
01:51:35,486 --> 01:51:37,078
Quick, under the cloak.

1165
01:51:37,755 --> 01:51:40,815
Don't say a word.
Be quiet, both of you.

1166
01:51:47,264 --> 01:51:50,324
-Professor Dumbledore, sir.
-Good evening, Hagrid.

1167
01:51:50,501 --> 01:51:52,935
l wonder, could we...?

1168
01:51:53,103 --> 01:51:55,594
Of course. Come in. Come in.

1169
01:51:55,773 --> 01:51:57,138
That's Dad's boss.

1170
01:51:57,308 --> 01:52:00,869
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.

1171
01:52:01,045 --> 01:52:05,448
Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.
Had to come.

1172
01:52:05,616 --> 01:52:08,847
Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things have gone far enough.

1173
01:52:09,019 --> 01:52:12,250
-The Ministry's got to act.
-But l never--

1174
01:52:12,456 --> 01:52:14,219
You know l never, professor.

1175
01:52:14,391 --> 01:52:17,485
l want it understood, Cornelius...

1176
01:52:17,661 --> 01:52:19,492
...that Hagrid...

1177
01:52:19,663 --> 01:52:21,961
...has my full confidence.

1178
01:52:22,132 --> 01:52:25,932
Albus, look,
Hagrid's record is against him.

1179
01:52:26,103 --> 01:52:28,628
-l've got to take him.
-Take me?

1180
01:52:28,806 --> 01:52:31,104
Take me where?
Not Azkaban prison.

1181
01:52:31,375 --> 01:52:35,141
l'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.

1182
01:52:35,779 --> 01:52:37,679
Already here, Fudge?

1183
01:52:37,848 --> 01:52:39,179
Good.

1184
01:52:40,084 --> 01:52:42,848
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!

1185
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,044
Believe me...

1186
01:52:45,356 --> 01:52:49,554
...l take absolutely no pleasure
being inside your....

1187
01:52:51,428 --> 01:52:53,658
You call this a house?

1188
01:52:54,732 --> 01:52:55,756
No.

1189
01:52:55,933 --> 01:52:59,835
l simply called up the school
and was told the headmaster was here.

1190
01:53:00,003 --> 01:53:04,064
Well, what exactly is it
that you want with me?

1191
01:53:04,641 --> 01:53:09,374
The other governors and l have decided
it's time for you to step aside.

1192
01:53:11,014 --> 01:53:13,915
This is an order of suspension.

1193
01:53:19,490 --> 01:53:22,857
You'll find all 12 signatures on it.

1194
01:53:26,730 --> 01:53:30,928
l'm afraid we feel
you've rather lost your touch.

1195
01:53:31,668 --> 01:53:34,000
Well, what, with all these attacks...

1196
01:53:34,171 --> 01:53:36,935
...there'll be no
Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.

1197
01:53:37,107 --> 01:53:41,669
l can only imagine what an awful loss
that would be to the school.

1198
01:53:41,845 --> 01:53:44,040
You can't take
Professor Dumbledore away.

1199
01:53:44,314 --> 01:53:46,874
Take him away and the Muggle-borns
won't stand a chance.

1200
01:53:47,050 --> 01:53:49,518
You mark my words,
there'll be killings next!

1201
01:53:49,686 --> 01:53:51,313
You think so?

1202
01:53:51,488 --> 01:53:54,013
Calm yourself, Hagrid.

1203
01:53:55,359 --> 01:53:58,089
lf the governors desire my removal...

1204
01:53:58,262 --> 01:54:01,959
...l will, of course, step aside.

1205
01:54:04,044 --> 01:54:06,274
However...

1206
01:54:06,947 --> 01:54:11,475
...you will find that help
will always be given at Hogwarts...

1207
01:54:11,652 --> 01:54:13,552
...to those who...

1208
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:16,052
...ask for it.

1209
01:54:22,863 --> 01:54:25,195
Admirable sentiments.

1210
01:54:25,365 --> 01:54:27,162
Shall we?

1211
01:54:39,279 --> 01:54:40,803
Fudge.

1212
01:54:42,549 --> 01:54:44,380
Come, Hagrid.

1213
01:54:45,485 --> 01:54:47,043
Well?

1214
01:54:47,721 --> 01:54:48,779
lf....

1215
01:54:49,189 --> 01:54:51,749
lf anybody was looking for some stuff...

1216
01:54:51,925 --> 01:54:56,794
...then all they'd have to do
would be to follow the spiders.

1217
01:54:56,964 --> 01:54:59,558
Yep. That would lead them right.

1218
01:54:59,733 --> 01:55:01,667
That's all l have to say.

1219
01:55:03,403 --> 01:55:07,134
And someone will need
to feed Fang while l'm away.

1220
01:55:10,510 --> 01:55:12,501
Good boy.

1221
01:55:18,652 --> 01:55:20,779
Hagrid's right.

1222
01:55:20,954 --> 01:55:23,889
With Dumbledore gone,
there'll be an attack a day.

1223
01:55:24,057 --> 01:55:25,718
Look.

1224
01:55:31,798 --> 01:55:33,595
Come on.

1225
01:55:37,304 --> 01:55:39,329
Come on, Fang.

1226
01:55:57,624 --> 01:55:58,989
Come on.

1227
01:55:59,159 --> 01:56:00,456
What?

1228
01:56:00,627 --> 01:56:03,858
You heard what Hagrid said.
''Follow the spiders.''

1229
01:56:04,031 --> 01:56:06,659
They're heading to the Dark Forest.

1230
01:56:08,702 --> 01:56:13,162
Why spiders? Why couldn't it be
''follow the butterflies''?

1231
01:57:27,359 --> 01:57:30,123
Harry, l don't like this.

1232
01:57:35,233 --> 01:57:38,430
-Harry, l don't like this at all.
-Shush!

1233
01:57:49,981 --> 01:57:52,506
Can we go back now?

1234
01:57:52,684 --> 01:57:54,413
Come on.

1235
01:58:44,135 --> 01:58:46,899
Who is it?

1236
01:58:47,572 --> 01:58:48,664
Don't panic.

1237
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:50,530
Hagrid?

1238
01:58:50,942 --> 01:58:52,534
ls that you?

1239
01:58:53,111 --> 01:58:55,045
We're friends of Hagrid's.

1240
01:59:13,131 --> 01:59:16,328
And you?
You're Aragog, aren't you?

1241
01:59:16,968 --> 01:59:18,265
Yes.

1242
01:59:18,436 --> 01:59:22,202
Hagrid has never sent
men into our hollow before.

1243
01:59:22,374 --> 01:59:25,502
He's in trouble. Up at the school,
there have been attacks.

1244
01:59:26,144 --> 01:59:28,009
They think it's Hagrid.

1245
01:59:28,246 --> 01:59:31,841
They think he opened
the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.

1246
01:59:32,083 --> 01:59:34,381
That's a lie.

1247
01:59:34,886 --> 01:59:37,821
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1248
01:59:38,456 --> 01:59:41,323
-Then you're not the monster?
-No.

1249
01:59:41,493 --> 01:59:44,519
The monster was born in the castle.

1250
01:59:44,763 --> 01:59:50,030
l came to Hagrid from a distant land
in the pocket of a traveler.

1251
01:59:50,635 --> 01:59:52,262
Harry.

1252
01:59:54,172 --> 01:59:58,734
But if you're not the monster, then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago?

1253
01:59:58,910 --> 02:00:01,902
We do not speak of it.

1254
02:00:02,247 --> 02:00:07,810
lt is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others.

1255
02:00:07,986 --> 02:00:09,749
But have you seen it?

1256
02:00:10,422 --> 02:00:16,258
l never saw any part of the castle
but the box in which Hagrid kept me.

1257
02:00:16,428 --> 02:00:19,591
The girl was discovered
in a bathroom.

1258
02:00:19,764 --> 02:00:24,258
When l was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.

1259
02:00:24,436 --> 02:00:26,461
-Harry!
-What?

1260
02:00:39,317 --> 02:00:42,309
Well, thank you.

1261
02:00:43,254 --> 02:00:45,415
We'll just go.

1262
02:00:45,890 --> 02:00:47,653
Go?

1263
02:00:47,826 --> 02:00:49,589
l think not.

1264
02:00:49,761 --> 02:00:55,222
My sons and daughters
do not harm Hagrid on my command.

1265
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:57,800
But l cannot deny them
fresh meat...

1266
02:00:57,969 --> 02:01:02,303
...when it wanders
so willingly into our midst.

1267
02:01:02,507 --> 02:01:06,273
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.

1268
02:01:06,444 --> 02:01:08,275
Can we panic now?

1269
02:01:18,990 --> 02:01:20,924
Know any spells?

1270
02:01:21,092 --> 02:01:24,255
One, but it's not powerful
enough for all of them.

1271
02:01:24,429 --> 02:01:27,159
Where's Hermione when you need her?

1272
02:01:40,678 --> 02:01:41,975
Let's go!

1273
02:01:47,118 --> 02:01:49,177
Arania Exumai!

1274
02:01:54,492 --> 02:01:55,823
Go!

1275
02:02:13,812 --> 02:02:15,871
Glad we're out of there.

1276
02:02:22,854 --> 02:02:25,186
Arania Exumai!

1277
02:02:30,895 --> 02:02:34,661
-Thanks for that.
-Don't mention it.

1278
02:02:45,577 --> 02:02:47,738
Get us out of here.

1279
02:02:48,246 --> 02:02:49,941
Now!

1280
02:02:52,016 --> 02:02:56,248
Come on!
Come on, move faster!

1281
02:02:58,957 --> 02:03:00,288
Come on! Go!

1282
02:03:17,697 --> 02:03:19,756
Get us in the air.

1283
02:03:20,834 --> 02:03:22,301
The flying gear's jammed!

1284
02:03:26,406 --> 02:03:30,172
-Come on! Pull!
-l'm trying!

1285
02:03:59,506 --> 02:04:02,441
Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.

1286
02:04:02,609 --> 02:04:06,943
lf Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,
l'll kill him.

1287
02:04:20,927 --> 02:04:24,158
l mean, what was the point
of sending us in there?

1288
02:04:24,331 --> 02:04:28,927
-What have we found out?
-We know one thing.

1289
02:04:29,102 --> 02:04:32,503
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1290
02:04:32,706 --> 02:04:34,697
He was innocent.

1291
02:04:50,190 --> 02:04:52,658
Wish you were here, Hermione.

1292
02:04:53,193 --> 02:04:55,457
We need you.

1293
02:04:56,396 --> 02:04:58,489
Now more than ever.

1294
02:05:15,415 --> 02:05:18,816
-What's that?
-Ron....

1295
02:05:19,653 --> 02:05:24,113
This is why Hermione was in
the library the day she was attacked.

1296
02:05:24,658 --> 02:05:25,920
Come on.

1297
02:05:26,593 --> 02:05:29,562
''Of the many fearsome beasts
that roam our land...

1298
02:05:29,729 --> 02:05:34,359
...none is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years...

1299
02:05:34,534 --> 02:05:38,300
...instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye.

1300
02:05:38,471 --> 02:05:41,463
Spiders flee before it.''
Ron, this is it.

1301
02:05:41,641 --> 02:05:44,439
The monster in the Chamber
of Secrets is a basilisk.

1302
02:05:44,611 --> 02:05:48,547
That's why l can hear it speak.
lt's a snake.

1303
02:05:48,882 --> 02:05:54,149
But if it kills by looking people
in the eye, why is it no one's dead?

1304
02:06:04,798 --> 02:06:07,699
Because no one did look it
in the eye.

1305
02:06:09,669 --> 02:06:12,263
Not directly, at least.

1306
02:06:13,506 --> 02:06:15,736
Colin saw it through his camera.

1307
02:06:15,909 --> 02:06:19,936
Justin-- Justin must have seen
the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.

1308
02:06:20,113 --> 02:06:24,106
Nick got the full blast of it.
But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.

1309
02:06:24,284 --> 02:06:27,412
And Hermione had the mirror.

1310
02:06:27,587 --> 02:06:30,954
l bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along.

1311
02:06:31,124 --> 02:06:32,386
And Mrs. Norris?

1312
02:06:32,559 --> 02:06:36,051
l'm pretty sure she didn't have
a camera or a mirror, Harry.

1313
02:06:37,630 --> 02:06:39,495
The water.

1314
02:06:39,966 --> 02:06:45,529
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.

1315
02:06:51,678 --> 02:06:53,612
''Spiders flee before it.''

1316
02:06:53,780 --> 02:06:57,511
-lt all fits.
-But how's a basilisk been getting around?

1317
02:06:57,684 --> 02:07:00,517
A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.

1318
02:07:00,754 --> 02:07:06,351
-Hermione's answered that too.
-Pipes? lt's using the plumbing.

1319
02:07:06,526 --> 02:07:10,792
Remember what Aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago?

1320
02:07:10,964 --> 02:07:15,196
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?

1321
02:07:15,869 --> 02:07:17,200
Moaning Myrtle.

1322
02:07:18,171 --> 02:07:22,198
All students are to return
to their house dormitories at once.

1323
02:07:22,375 --> 02:07:25,811
All teachers to the second-floor
corridor immediately.

1324
02:07:30,817 --> 02:07:36,653
As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin
has left another message.

1325
02:07:36,823 --> 02:07:39,018
Our worst fear has been realized.

1326
02:07:39,192 --> 02:07:43,754
A student has been taken by the monster
into the Chamber itself.

1327
02:07:44,831 --> 02:07:50,497
The students must be sent home.
l'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

1328
02:07:52,872 --> 02:07:55,306
So sorry. Dozed off.
What have l missed?

1329
02:07:55,475 --> 02:07:59,844
A girl has been snatched by the monster,
Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

1330
02:08:00,013 --> 02:08:02,948
-My moment?
-Weren't you saying just last night...

1331
02:08:03,116 --> 02:08:07,644
...that you've known all along where
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?

1332
02:08:09,022 --> 02:08:14,483
That's settled. We'll leave you
to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.

1333
02:08:14,661 --> 02:08:19,860
-Your skills, after all, are legend.
-Very well.

1334
02:08:20,033 --> 02:08:23,230
l'll just be in my office getting....

1335
02:08:24,070 --> 02:08:26,038
Getting ready.

1336
02:08:28,942 --> 02:08:32,139
Who is it that the monster's taken,
Minerva?

1337
02:08:32,312 --> 02:08:34,143
Ginny Weasley.

1338
02:08:45,558 --> 02:08:48,618
''Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever.''

1339
02:08:52,665 --> 02:08:54,462
Ginny.

1340
02:08:56,536 --> 02:09:00,028
Lockhart may be useless, but he's
going to try and get into the Chamber.

1341
02:09:00,206 --> 02:09:02,936
At least we can tell him
what we know.

1342
02:09:04,277 --> 02:09:06,837
Professor, we have some information
for you.

1343
02:09:08,615 --> 02:09:10,583
Are you going somewhere?

1344
02:09:10,750 --> 02:09:13,844
Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
Got to go.

1345
02:09:14,020 --> 02:09:17,251
-What about my sister?
-Well....

1346
02:09:17,590 --> 02:09:21,048
As to that, most unfortunate.
No one regrets more than l.

1347
02:09:21,227 --> 02:09:25,220
You're the Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher. You can't go now.

1348
02:09:25,398 --> 02:09:28,390
l must say, when l took the job,
there was nothing in the description--

1349
02:09:28,568 --> 02:09:29,728
You're running away?

1350
02:09:29,903 --> 02:09:32,701
-After all you did in your books?
-Books can be misleading.

1351
02:09:32,872 --> 02:09:35,432
-You wrote them.
-My dear boy, do use your common sense.

1352
02:09:35,608 --> 02:09:40,011
My books wouldn't have sold half as well
if people didn't think l'd done those things.

1353
02:09:40,580 --> 02:09:42,172
You're a fraud.

1354
02:09:42,348 --> 02:09:45,146
You've been taking credit
for what other wizards have done.

1355
02:09:45,318 --> 02:09:47,252
ls there anything you can do?

1356
02:09:47,420 --> 02:09:52,153
Yes, now you mention it.
l'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.

1357
02:09:52,325 --> 02:09:54,816
Otherwise, all those wizards
would have gone blabbing.

1358
02:09:54,994 --> 02:09:58,088
l'd never have sold another book.

1359
02:09:58,264 --> 02:10:03,998
ln fact, l'm going to have to do
the same to you.

1360
02:10:04,504 --> 02:10:07,268
Don't even think about it.

1361
02:10:18,151 --> 02:10:19,584
Who's there?

1362
02:10:22,021 --> 02:10:24,046
Hello, Harry.

1363
02:10:24,991 --> 02:10:30,156
-What do you want?
-To ask you how you died.

1364
02:10:32,532 --> 02:10:34,966
lt was dreadful.

1365
02:10:35,134 --> 02:10:38,831
lt happened right here
in this very cubicle.

1366
02:10:39,005 --> 02:10:43,032
l'd hidden because Olive Hornby
was teasing me about my glasses.

1367
02:10:43,209 --> 02:10:48,112
l was crying, and then
l heard somebody come in.

1368
02:10:48,281 --> 02:10:54,618
-Who was it, Myrtle?
-l don't know. l was distraught!

1369
02:10:55,922 --> 02:10:59,323
But they said something funny,
a kind of made-up language.

1370
02:10:59,492 --> 02:11:05,829
And l realized it was a boy, so l unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and...

1371
02:11:07,033 --> 02:11:11,868
-...l died.
-Just like that? How?

1372
02:11:12,038 --> 02:11:16,532
l just remember seeing a pair
of great, big, yellow eyes...

1373
02:11:16,709 --> 02:11:20,543
...over there by that sink.

1374
02:11:45,638 --> 02:11:47,663
This is it.

1375
02:11:48,574 --> 02:11:53,375
This is it, Ron. l think this is
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.

1376
02:11:55,381 --> 02:12:00,250
Say something. Harry,
say something in Parseltongue.

1377
02:12:51,771 --> 02:12:55,867
Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Well, then, l'll just be....

1378
02:12:56,042 --> 02:12:58,306
There's no need for me to stay.

1379
02:12:58,911 --> 02:13:00,811
Yes, there is.

1380
02:13:02,615 --> 02:13:05,709
-You first.
-Now, boys, what good will it do?

1381
02:13:05,885 --> 02:13:07,216
Better you than us.

1382
02:13:08,421 --> 02:13:11,356
But-- Obviously, yes.

1383
02:13:15,628 --> 02:13:18,358
Sure you don't want to test it first?

1384
02:13:25,171 --> 02:13:28,402
lt's really quite filthy down here.

1385
02:13:28,875 --> 02:13:33,403
-All right. Let's go.
-Oh, Harry?

1386
02:13:33,813 --> 02:13:38,750
lf you die down there,
you're welcome to share my toilet.

1387
02:13:41,287 --> 02:13:43,255
Thanks, Myrtle.

1388
02:14:12,351 --> 02:14:17,550
Now, remember: Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straightaway.

1389
02:14:18,491 --> 02:14:20,152
Go on.

1390
02:14:23,863 --> 02:14:25,194
This way.

1391
02:14:32,238 --> 02:14:37,471
-What's this?
-lt looks like a snake.

1392
02:14:37,643 --> 02:14:41,306
-lt's a snakeskin.
-Bloody hell.

1393
02:14:41,481 --> 02:14:47,283
Whatever shed this must be
60 feet long. Or more.

1394
02:14:49,188 --> 02:14:52,157
Heart of a lion, this one.

1395
02:14:55,862 --> 02:15:00,526
The adventure ends here, boys.
But don't fret.

1396
02:15:02,468 --> 02:15:07,929
The world will know our story.
How l was too late to save the girl.

1397
02:15:08,274 --> 02:15:11,766
How you two
tragically lost your minds...

1398
02:15:11,944 --> 02:15:14,913
...at the sight of her mangled body.

1399
02:15:15,781 --> 02:15:17,214
So....

1400
02:15:18,351 --> 02:15:20,683
You first, Mr. Potter.

1401
02:15:20,920 --> 02:15:24,083
Say goodbye to your memories.

1402
02:15:26,158 --> 02:15:28,092
Obliviate!

1403
02:16:02,028 --> 02:16:05,156
-Ron! Ron, are you okay?
-l'm fine.

1404
02:16:08,901 --> 02:16:10,664
Hello.

1405
02:16:11,337 --> 02:16:13,168
Who are you?

1406
02:16:14,540 --> 02:16:17,202
-Ron Weasley.
-Really?

1407
02:16:17,376 --> 02:16:20,243
And who am l?

1408
02:16:22,014 --> 02:16:26,314
Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is.

1409
02:16:26,652 --> 02:16:31,146
lt's an odd sort of place, isn't it?

1410
02:16:31,324 --> 02:16:33,451
Do you live here?

1411
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:36,685
-No.
-Really?

1412
02:16:41,267 --> 02:16:43,064
-What do l do now?
-You wait here...

1413
02:16:43,235 --> 02:16:46,170
...and try and shift some of this rock
so we can get back through.

1414
02:16:46,339 --> 02:16:50,002
-l'll go on and find Ginny.
-Okay.

1415
02:18:23,235 --> 02:18:27,103
Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead.
Wake up, wake up.

1416
02:18:27,606 --> 02:18:29,699
Please wake up.

1417
02:18:29,975 --> 02:18:32,102
She won't wake.

1418
02:18:37,583 --> 02:18:41,917
Tom. Tom Riddle.
What do you mean, she won't wake?

1419
02:18:42,088 --> 02:18:45,455
-She's not...?
-She's still alive, but only just.

1420
02:18:46,459 --> 02:18:48,757
-Are you a ghost?
-A memory...

1421
02:18:48,928 --> 02:18:51,328
...preserved in a diary for 50 years.

1422
02:18:53,999 --> 02:18:59,198
She's cold as ice.
Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.

1423
02:18:59,371 --> 02:19:01,771
You've got to help me, Tom.
There's a basilisk.

1424
02:19:01,941 --> 02:19:04,535
lt won't come until it's called.

1425
02:19:07,346 --> 02:19:10,144
-Give me my wand, Tom.
-You won't be needing it.

1426
02:19:11,217 --> 02:19:14,618
-We've got to go. We've got to save her.
-l'm afraid l can't do that.

1427
02:19:14,787 --> 02:19:18,814
You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker,
l grow stronger.

1428
02:19:20,192 --> 02:19:24,686
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

1429
02:19:24,864 --> 02:19:27,196
No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.

1430
02:19:27,366 --> 02:19:30,563
lt was Ginny who set the basilisk
on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...

1431
02:19:30,736 --> 02:19:33,170
...Ginny who wrote the threatening
messages on the walls.

1432
02:19:33,339 --> 02:19:36,638
-But why?
-Because l told her to.

1433
02:19:36,809 --> 02:19:41,769
You'll find l can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing.

1434
02:19:41,947 --> 02:19:45,280
She was, shall we say,
in a kind of trance.

1435
02:19:45,818 --> 02:19:48,309
Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her.

1436
02:19:48,487 --> 02:19:50,853
She tried to dispose of it
in the girls' bathroom.

1437
02:19:51,023 --> 02:19:55,392
And then who should find it but you?

1438
02:19:55,561 --> 02:19:58,655
The very person
l was most anxious to meet.

1439
02:19:59,265 --> 02:20:01,324
And why did you want to meet me?

1440
02:20:01,734 --> 02:20:05,101
l knew l had to talk to you,
meet you if l could.

1441
02:20:05,271 --> 02:20:08,536
So l decided to show you my capture
of that brainless oaf Hagrid...

1442
02:20:08,707 --> 02:20:11,870
-...to gain your trust.
-Hagrid's my friend.

1443
02:20:12,812 --> 02:20:17,408
-And you framed him, didn't you?
-lt was my word against Hagrid's.

1444
02:20:17,583 --> 02:20:20,848
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent.

1445
02:20:21,020 --> 02:20:23,181
l'll bet Dumbledore saw
right through you.

1446
02:20:23,355 --> 02:20:26,813
He certainly kept an annoyingly close
watch on me after that.

1447
02:20:26,992 --> 02:20:30,291
l knew it wouldn't be safe to open the
Chamber again while l was still at school...

1448
02:20:30,462 --> 02:20:32,293
...so l decided to leave behind
a diary...

1449
02:20:32,464 --> 02:20:34,557
...preserving my 16-year-old self
in its pages...

1450
02:20:34,733 --> 02:20:37,429
...so that one day
l would be able to lead another...

1451
02:20:37,603 --> 02:20:40,401
...to finish Salazar Slytherin's
noble work.

1452
02:20:40,573 --> 02:20:42,837
Well, you haven't finished it
this time.

1453
02:20:43,008 --> 02:20:45,977
ln a few hours, the Mandrake Draught
will be ready.

1454
02:20:46,145 --> 02:20:48,875
And everyone who was Petrified
will be all right again.

1455
02:20:49,281 --> 02:20:54,514
Haven't l told you? Killing Mudbloods
doesn't matter to me anymore.

1456
02:20:54,787 --> 02:20:59,554
For many months now,
my new target has been you.

1457
02:21:01,026 --> 02:21:04,621
How is it that a baby
with no extraordinary magical talent...

1458
02:21:04,797 --> 02:21:07,459
...was able to defeat the greatest wizard
of all time?

1459
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:10,735
How did you escape with nothing
but a scar...

1460
02:21:10,903 --> 02:21:13,303
...while Lord Voldemort's powers
were destroyed?

1461
02:21:13,472 --> 02:21:17,636
Why do you care how l escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

1462
02:21:17,810 --> 02:21:24,272
Voldemort is my past,
present and future.

1463
02:21:44,703 --> 02:21:48,139
You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.

1464
02:21:51,310 --> 02:21:54,905
-You're Voldemort.
-Surely you didn't think...

1465
02:21:55,080 --> 02:21:59,574
...l was going to keep
my filthy Muggle father's name?

1466
02:21:59,752 --> 02:22:03,916
No. l fashioned myself a new name,
a name l knew wizards everywhere...

1467
02:22:04,089 --> 02:22:08,287
...would one day fear to speak when l
became the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1468
02:22:08,460 --> 02:22:11,623
Albus Dumbledore
is the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1469
02:22:11,797 --> 02:22:15,198
Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of me.

1470
02:22:15,367 --> 02:22:20,430
He'll never be gone. Not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him.

1471
02:22:26,845 --> 02:22:27,834
Fawkes?

1472
02:22:44,129 --> 02:22:47,690
So this is what Dumbledore
sends his great defender.

1473
02:22:47,866 --> 02:22:51,563
A songbird and an old hat.

1474
02:23:04,850 --> 02:23:09,378
Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort,
Heir of Salazar Slytherin...

1475
02:23:09,555 --> 02:23:13,582
...against the famous Harry Potter.

1476
02:23:26,905 --> 02:23:31,239
Parseltongue won't save you now,
Potter. lt only obeys me.

1477
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:02,998
No!

1478
02:24:03,442 --> 02:24:07,936
Your bird may have blinded the basilisk,
but it can still hear you.

1479
02:25:49,948 --> 02:25:53,247
Yes, Potter.
The process is nearly complete.

1480
02:25:53,418 --> 02:25:58,321
ln a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead, and l will cease to be a memory.

1481
02:25:58,490 --> 02:26:01,152
Lord Voldemort will return...

1482
02:26:01,527 --> 02:26:05,725
...very much alive.

1483
02:26:06,465 --> 02:26:07,864
Ginny?

1484
02:28:24,202 --> 02:28:25,794
Remarkable, isn't it...

1485
02:28:25,971 --> 02:28:29,964
...how quickly the venom
of the basilisk penetrates the body?

1486
02:28:30,142 --> 02:28:32,804
l'd guess you have little more
than a minute to live.

1487
02:28:33,145 --> 02:28:37,172
You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.

1488
02:28:42,187 --> 02:28:45,850
Funny, the damage a silly
little book can do...

1489
02:28:46,024 --> 02:28:51,052
...especially in the hands
of a silly little girl.

1490
02:28:53,932 --> 02:28:55,763
What are you doing?

1491
02:28:58,570 --> 02:29:00,697
Stop. No!

1492
02:29:58,997 --> 02:30:02,956
lt was me.
But l swear, l didn't mean to.

1493
02:30:03,135 --> 02:30:06,627
Riddle made me, and....

1494
02:30:07,172 --> 02:30:09,800
Harry, you're hurt.

1495
02:30:10,175 --> 02:30:11,665
Don't worry.

1496
02:30:11,843 --> 02:30:15,472
Ginny, you need
to get yourself out.

1497
02:30:15,647 --> 02:30:18,912
Follow the Chamber
and you'll find Ron.

1498
02:30:31,062 --> 02:30:33,189
You were brilliant, Fawkes.

1499
02:30:34,299 --> 02:30:36,733
l just wasn't quick enough.

1500
02:30:57,522 --> 02:30:59,251
Of course.

1501
02:30:59,524 --> 02:31:02,391
Phoenix tears have healing powers.

1502
02:31:03,995 --> 02:31:05,792
Thanks.

1503
02:31:07,532 --> 02:31:09,659
lt's all right, Ginny.

1504
02:31:10,802 --> 02:31:12,997
lt's over.

1505
02:31:14,005 --> 02:31:16,530
lt's just a memory.

1506
02:31:19,444 --> 02:31:24,780
Amazing!
This is just like magic!

1507
02:31:36,061 --> 02:31:38,723
You both realize, of course...

1508
02:31:38,897 --> 02:31:44,392
...that in the past few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules.

1509
02:31:45,070 --> 02:31:46,059
Yes, sir.

1510
02:31:46,238 --> 02:31:49,469
There is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled.

1511
02:31:49,641 --> 02:31:50,835
Yes, sir.

1512
02:31:51,009 --> 02:31:53,773
Therefore, it is only fitting...

1513
02:31:55,313 --> 02:31:57,577
...that you both receive...

1514
02:31:58,083 --> 02:32:02,179
...Special Awards for Services
to the School.

1515
02:32:04,256 --> 02:32:06,121
Thanks, sir.

1516
02:32:06,691 --> 02:32:08,989
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would...

1517
02:32:09,160 --> 02:32:13,324
...have an owl deliver these
release papers to Azkaban.

1518
02:32:14,432 --> 02:32:19,199
l believe we want
our gamekeeper back.

1519
02:32:24,175 --> 02:32:28,509
First, l want to thank you, Harry.

1520
02:32:29,147 --> 02:32:32,639
You must have shown me
real loyalty down in the Chamber.

1521
02:32:33,518 --> 02:32:38,080
Nothing but that
could have called Fawkes to you.

1522
02:32:40,492 --> 02:32:42,016
And...

1523
02:32:42,594 --> 02:32:44,027
...second...

1524
02:32:44,195 --> 02:32:48,962
...l sense that something
is troubling you.

1525
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:51,691
Am l right, Harry?

1526
02:32:53,538 --> 02:32:55,267
lt's just....

1527
02:32:56,441 --> 02:33:01,174
You see, sir, l couldn't help
but notice certain things, certain....

1528
02:33:01,346 --> 02:33:06,978
Certain similarities
between Tom Riddle and me.

1529
02:33:07,552 --> 02:33:08,746
l see.

1530
02:33:08,920 --> 02:33:14,722
Well, you can speak
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?

1531
02:33:15,160 --> 02:33:20,689
Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.

1532
02:33:21,900 --> 02:33:24,630
lf l'm not mistaken, Harry...

1533
02:33:25,036 --> 02:33:28,870
...he transferred
some of his powers to you...

1534
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:31,975
...the night he gave you that scar.

1535
02:33:32,143 --> 02:33:36,045
Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?

1536
02:33:37,949 --> 02:33:40,645
Not intentionally...

1537
02:33:41,553 --> 02:33:43,453
...but yes.

1538
02:33:45,390 --> 02:33:48,689
So the Sorting Hat was right.
l should be in Slytherin.

1539
02:33:48,860 --> 02:33:53,695
lt's true. You possess many of the
qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.

1540
02:33:53,865 --> 02:33:56,732
Determination, resourcefulness...

1541
02:33:56,901 --> 02:34:00,894
...and if l may say so,
a certain disregard for the rules.

1542
02:34:01,573 --> 02:34:05,566
Why, then, did the Sorting Hat
place you in Gryffindor?

1543
02:34:06,378 --> 02:34:10,075
-Because l asked it to.
-Exactly, Harry. Exactly.

1544
02:34:10,248 --> 02:34:12,307
Which makes you different
from Voldemort.

1545
02:34:12,484 --> 02:34:16,352
lt is not our abilities
that show what we truly are.

1546
02:34:16,655 --> 02:34:18,782
lt is our choices.

1547
02:34:22,460 --> 02:34:25,861
lf you want proof
why you belong in Gryffindor...

1548
02:34:26,031 --> 02:34:30,900
...then l suggest
you look more closely at this.

1549
02:34:31,903 --> 02:34:33,598
Be careful.

1550
02:34:39,244 --> 02:34:41,906
Godric Gryffindor.

1551
02:34:42,080 --> 02:34:46,176
lt would take a true Gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat.

1552
02:34:55,060 --> 02:34:56,459
Dobby.

1553
02:34:57,729 --> 02:35:02,098
So this is your master.
The family you serve is the Malfoys.

1554
02:35:04,302 --> 02:35:07,635
l'll deal with you later.

1555
02:35:13,478 --> 02:35:15,070
Out of my way, Potter.

1556
02:35:15,246 --> 02:35:18,841
So it's true. You have returned.

1557
02:35:19,517 --> 02:35:22,281
When the governors learned that
Arthur Weasley's daughter...

1558
02:35:22,454 --> 02:35:26,652
...was taken into the Chamber,
they saw fit to summon me back.

1559
02:35:27,492 --> 02:35:31,553
-Ridiculous.
-Curiously, Lucius, several of them...

1560
02:35:31,730 --> 02:35:35,393
...were under the impression
that you would curse their family...

1561
02:35:35,567 --> 02:35:38,400
...if they did not agree
to suspend me in the first place.

1562
02:35:38,870 --> 02:35:42,328
-How dare you!
-Beg your pardon?

1563
02:35:42,507 --> 02:35:46,273
My sole concern has always been
and will always be...

1564
02:35:46,444 --> 02:35:49,277
...the welfare of this school...

1565
02:35:49,447 --> 02:35:53,747
...and, of course, its students.

1566
02:35:57,789 --> 02:36:01,987
The culprit has been identified,
l presume?

1567
02:36:02,393 --> 02:36:03,917
Yes.

1568
02:36:05,530 --> 02:36:07,361
And?

1569
02:36:08,533 --> 02:36:10,558
Who was it?

1570
02:36:16,975 --> 02:36:19,535
Voldemort.

1571
02:36:20,678 --> 02:36:26,139
Only this time he chose to act
through somebody else...

1572
02:36:26,684 --> 02:36:30,313
...by means of this.

1573
02:36:32,991 --> 02:36:34,515
l see.

1574
02:36:35,994 --> 02:36:40,192
Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter
discovered it.

1575
02:36:40,565 --> 02:36:44,228
One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old school-things...

1576
02:36:44,402 --> 02:36:47,633
...should find their way
into innocent hands.

1577
02:36:47,972 --> 02:36:51,908
The consequences for the one
responsible would be...

1578
02:36:52,277 --> 02:36:54,142
...severe.

1579
02:36:55,547 --> 02:36:58,345
Well, let us hope...

1580
02:36:58,516 --> 02:37:04,045
...that Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.

1581
02:37:04,823 --> 02:37:08,589
Don't worry. l will be.

1582
02:37:17,335 --> 02:37:19,360
Dumbledore.

1583
02:37:20,505 --> 02:37:24,032
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.

1584
02:37:41,326 --> 02:37:45,763
Sir?
l wonder if l could have that?

1585
02:37:52,203 --> 02:37:53,795
Mr. Malfoy.

1586
02:37:53,972 --> 02:37:56,167
Mr. Malfoy!

1587
02:37:56,641 --> 02:37:58,802
l have something of yours.

1588
02:38:00,478 --> 02:38:03,413
Mine? l don't know
what you're talking about.

1589
02:38:03,648 --> 02:38:05,172
l think you do, sir.

1590
02:38:05,350 --> 02:38:08,444
l think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...

1591
02:38:08,620 --> 02:38:10,053
...that day at Diagon Alley.

1592
02:38:10,755 --> 02:38:13,280
You do, do you?

1593
02:38:20,665 --> 02:38:23,725
Why don't you prove it?

1594
02:38:29,974 --> 02:38:32,135
Come, Dobby.

1595
02:38:33,444 --> 02:38:35,469
Open it.

1596
02:38:39,017 --> 02:38:40,541
Dobby.

1597
02:38:40,718 --> 02:38:43,881
Master has given Dobby a sock.

1598
02:38:44,155 --> 02:38:46,248
What? l didn't give--

1599
02:38:46,424 --> 02:38:50,121
Master has presented Dobby
with clothes.

1600
02:38:50,295 --> 02:38:53,355
Dobby is free.

1601
02:38:59,904 --> 02:39:03,635
You lost me my servant!

1602
02:39:10,615 --> 02:39:14,608
You shall not harm Harry Potter.

1603
02:39:26,764 --> 02:39:30,461
Your parents were
meddlesome fools too.

1604
02:39:30,635 --> 02:39:33,798
Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon...

1605
02:39:33,972 --> 02:39:39,171
...you are going to meet
the same sticky end.

1606
02:39:44,882 --> 02:39:50,787
Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?

1607
02:39:51,155 --> 02:39:55,387
-Just promise me something.
-Anything, sir.

1608
02:39:57,362 --> 02:39:59,830
Never try to save my life again.

1609
02:40:05,970 --> 02:40:08,962
-Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
-Thank you.

1610
02:40:09,273 --> 02:40:11,639
-Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
-Good evening.

1611
02:40:11,809 --> 02:40:14,710
-Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
-Thank you.

1612
02:40:16,114 --> 02:40:18,309
Hello.

1613
02:40:20,018 --> 02:40:24,648
-Hermione! Welcome back.
-Thanks, Sir Nicholas.

1614
02:40:27,892 --> 02:40:31,225
Harry. lt's Hermione.

1615
02:40:58,056 --> 02:41:01,753
-Welcome back, Hermione.
-lt's good to be back.

1616
02:41:01,926 --> 02:41:04,520
Congratulations.
l can't believe you solved it.

1617
02:41:04,695 --> 02:41:06,959
We had loads of help from you.

1618
02:41:07,131 --> 02:41:10,362
-We couldn't have done it without you.
-Thanks.

1619
02:41:12,203 --> 02:41:15,172
Could l have your attention, please?

1620
02:41:19,310 --> 02:41:21,835
Before we begin the feast...

1621
02:41:22,013 --> 02:41:28,248
...let us have a round of applause
for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...

1622
02:41:28,419 --> 02:41:32,549
...whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered...

1623
02:41:32,723 --> 02:41:35,385
...to all who had been Petrified.

1624
02:41:45,903 --> 02:41:48,895
Also, in light of the recent events...

1625
02:41:49,073 --> 02:41:51,234
...as a school treat...

1626
02:41:51,409 --> 02:41:55,368
...all exams have been canceled.

1627
02:41:58,049 --> 02:41:59,607
Oh, no.

1628
02:42:16,567 --> 02:42:18,592
Sorry l'm late.

1629
02:42:24,642 --> 02:42:29,045
The owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused.

1630
02:42:29,380 --> 02:42:32,679
Some ruddy bird called Errol.

1631
02:42:48,466 --> 02:42:54,462
And l'd just like to say that if it hadn't
been for you, Harry and Ron...

1632
02:42:54,639 --> 02:42:57,574
...and Hermione, of course...

1633
02:42:58,242 --> 02:43:02,338
...l would still be you-know-where...

1634
02:43:02,513 --> 02:43:06,074
...so l'd just like to say thanks.

1635
02:43:15,493 --> 02:43:18,428
There's no Hogwarts
without you, Hagrid.
