1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:00,700
Engsub

2
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:24,382
Master Kaecilius.

3
00:02:25,988 --> 00:02:29,115
That ritual will bring you only sorrow.

4
00:03:04,908 --> 00:03:06,608
Hypocrite!

5
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,690
Challenge round, Billy.

6
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,499
Oh, come on, Billy.
You gotta be messing with me.

7
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,200
No, doctor.

8
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:14,809
Feels So Good, Chuck Mangione, 1977.

9
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:18,826
Seriously, Billy, you said this one
would be hard.  - Hah! It's 1978.

10
00:05:18,827 --> 00:05:21,710
No, Billy, while Feels So Good
may have charted in 1978,

11
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:25,199
the album was released in December, 1977.

12
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,929
No, no. Wikipedia says the...
- Check again.

13
00:05:27,938 --> 00:05:30,579
When did you...?  - Where do you store
all this useless information?

14
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:34,247
Useless? The man charted a
top ten hit with a Flugelhorn.

15
00:05:34,556 --> 00:05:37,876
- Status, Billy? - 1977.
- All clean.

16
00:05:37,877 --> 00:05:38,699
I hate you.

17
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,600
Woah! "Feels so good", doesn't it?

18
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:48,289
Oh, I... I've got this, Stephen. You've
done your bit. Go ahead, we'll close up.

19
00:05:49,604 --> 00:05:51,305
- What is that?
- GSW. <font color="#fdff44"><i>(Gunshot wound)</i></font>

20
00:05:52,808 --> 00:05:55,531
It's amazing you kept him alive.

21
00:05:55,532 --> 00:05:57,532
Apneic, further brain stem
testing after reflex test...

22
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,617
I think I found the problem, Dr. Palmer.

23
00:05:59,987 --> 00:06:03,087
You left a bullet in his head.
- Thanks. It's impinging on the medulla.

24
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:08,300
I needed a specialist to diagnose brain death.
Something about that doesn't feel right to me.

25
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,200
We have to run.

26
00:06:10,693 --> 00:06:14,710
Dr. West! What are you doing? Hey!
- Organ harvesting. He's a donor.

27
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:18,699
Slow down. I did not agree to that.  - I don't
need you to. We've already called brain death.

28
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,155
Too premature. We need to get him
prepped for a suboccipital craniotomy.

29
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:23,800
I'm not going to let you operate
on a dead man.  - What do you see?

30
00:06:23,847 --> 00:06:29,849
A bullet?  - A perfect bullet. It's been hardened.
You harden a bullet by alloying lead with antimony.

31
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,599
A toxic metal. And as it leaks directly
into the cerebral spinal fluid...

32
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:36,200
Rapid-onset central nervous system
shutdown.  - We need to go.

33
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:38,400
The patient's not dead, but he's dying.
Do you still want to harvest his organs?

34
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,700
I'll assist you.
- No!

35
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,579
Dr. Palmer will assist me.

36
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:01,291
Thank you.

37
00:07:07,544 --> 00:07:10,663
Image status, STAT.
- We do not have time for that.

38
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,299
You can't do it by hand.
- I can and I will.

39
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,613
This isn't the time
for showing off, Strange.

40
00:07:16,648 --> 00:07:19,513
How about ten minutes ago, when
you called the wrong time of death?

41
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,030
Cranial nerves intact.

42
00:07:55,171 --> 00:07:57,305
Dr. West, cover your watch.

43
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:43,399
You know, you didn't have to
humiliate him in front of everyone.

44
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,200
I didn't have to save his patient either. But,
you know, sometimes I just can't help myself.

45
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:50,700
Nick is a great doctor.
- You came to me.

46
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:53,500
Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.
- You had a second opinion.

47
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:57,700
What you needed was a competent one.  - Well, all the
more reason why you should be my neurosurgeon on call.

48
00:08:57,701 --> 00:08:59,100
You could make such a difference.

49
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:01,025
I can't work in your butcher shop.
- Hey! Look, he...

50
00:09:01,026 --> 00:09:04,900
Look, I'm using transsectioned spinal cords to
stimulate neurogenesis in the central nervous system.

51
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:07,110
My work is at least going to
save thousands for years to come.

52
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:10,100
In the ER, I get to save one drunk idiot with a gun.

53
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:12,378
Yeah, you're right. In the ER,
you're only saving lives.

54
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:15,160
There's no fame,
there's no CNN interviews...

55
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:17,686
Well, I guess I'll have to stick with Nick.

56
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:20,530
Oh, wait a minute. You're not...
you guys aren't...

57
00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:25,100
What?  - Sleeping together. Sorry,
I thought that was implicit in my disgust.

58
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:25,949
Explicit, actually.

59
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,900
And no, I have a very strict rule
against dating colleagues.

60
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,800
Oh really?
- I call it the Strange policy.

61
00:09:30,801 --> 00:09:33,700
Oh, good! I'm glad something is named after me.

62
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:35,700
You know, I invented a laminectomy procedure,

63
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:38,999
and yet, somehow, no one seems to want
to call it the Strange technique.

64
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We invented that technique.  - You know,
I gotta say, I'm very flattered by your policy.

65
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:49,076
Look, I'm talking tonight at a
Neurological Society dinner. Come with me.

66
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:53,100
Another speaking engagement? So romantic.

67
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:54,600
You used to love going to those things with me.

68
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:56,700
We had fun together.
- No. You've had fun.

69
00:09:56,701 --> 00:10:01,100
They weren't about us, they were about you.

70
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:04,400
- Not only about me.
- Stephen. Everything is about you.

71
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:09,499
Maybe we can hyphenate. Strange-Palmer technique.

72
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,300
Palmer-Strange.

73
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,200
Billy! What have you got for me?

74
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:05,150
I've got a 35-year-old Air Force colonel.
Crushed his lower spine

75
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:08,198
in some kind of experimental armor.
Mid-thoracic vertebral fracture.

76
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:10,999
Well, I could help, but
so can 50 other people.

77
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,800
Find me something worth my time.

78
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,699
I have a 68-year-old female
with an advanced brain stem glioma.

79
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,100
Yeah, you want me to screw up
my perfect record? Definitely not.

80
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:23,049
How about a 22-year-old
female with an electronic

81
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:26,084
implant in her brain to control
schizophrenia struck by lightning?

82
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:28,064
That does sound interesting.

83
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,298
Could you send me the... got it.

84
00:12:34,543 --> 00:12:36,243
Hey.

85
00:12:37,438 --> 00:12:39,300
It's okay. It's going to be okay.

86
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:55,510
What did they do?

87
00:12:56,684 --> 00:13:02,000
They rushed you in a chopper.
But it took a little while to find you.

88
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,699
Golden hours for nerve damage went by
while you were in the car.

89
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,700
What did they do?!?

90
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:14,200
11 stainless steel pins in the bones.

91
00:13:15,204 --> 00:13:16,904
Multiple torn ligaments.

92
00:13:17,883 --> 00:13:20,368
Severe nerve damage in both hands.

93
00:13:21,202 --> 00:13:23,600
You were on the table for 11 hours.

94
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,810
Look at these fixators.

95
00:13:27,718 --> 00:13:29,900
No one could have done better.

96
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,048
I could have done better.

97
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:09,700
No. No.
- Give your body time to heal.

98
00:14:11,345 --> 00:14:13,400
You ruined me.

99
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:16,049
How long until I'm...

100
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,199
Dr. Strange... those tissues
are still healing.

101
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,720
So speed it up. Pass the stent under the
brachial artery under the radial artery.

102
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:25,425
It's possible.

103
00:14:26,018 --> 00:14:29,000
Experimental and expensive, but possible.

104
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:30,774
All I need is possible.

105
00:14:54,696 --> 00:14:56,396
Up.

106
00:14:56,741 --> 00:14:58,514
Up.

107
00:14:58,515 --> 00:15:00,215
Show me your strength.

108
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,400
Ah! It's useless. - It's not
useless, man, you can do this.

109
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:13,679
Then answer me this, bachelor's degree.

110
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:18,400
Have you ever known anyone
with nerve damage this severe

111
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:20,100
to do this, and actually recover?

112
00:15:20,101 --> 00:15:26,286
One guy, yeah. Factory accident, broke
his back. Paralyzed. His leg wasted away.

113
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:29,070
He had pain in his shoulder from the wheelchair.

114
00:15:29,071 --> 00:15:31,400
He came in 3 times a week.

115
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:34,390
But one day he stopped coming.
I thought he was dead.

116
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,198
A few years later, he
walked past me on the street.

117
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,500
He walked? - Yeah, he walked.
- Bullshit. Show me his file.

118
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:44,380
It can take me a while to pull
the files from the archive.

119
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:47,330
But if it proves your arrogant ass wrong,

120
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,050
it's worth it.

121
00:16:02,835 --> 00:16:05,300
I looked at all your research.

122
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:09,540
I read all the papers you've sent,
but... none will work.

123
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:13,399
I... I don't think you realize
how severe the damage is, I...

124
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,500
Look, here's the thing, I ...
- At best, I'd try and fail.

125
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:18,190
Look, I understand.
Here's the thing. I...

126
00:16:18,191 --> 00:16:21,320
What you want from me is impossible,
Stephen.  - Come on...

127
00:16:21,324 --> 00:16:23,856
I've got my own reputation to consider.
- Etienne, wait.

128
00:16:23,891 --> 00:16:27,200
I can't help you. ...
- No. No, no, wait!

129
00:16:32,543 --> 00:16:34,243
Hi.

130
00:16:40,023 --> 00:16:41,723
He won't do it.

131
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:45,615
He's a hack.

132
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:50,435
There's a new procedure in Tokyo.
They culture donor stem cells

133
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:54,500
and then harvest them and 3D-print a scaffold.
If I could get a loan together, just...

134
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:56,350
Stephen...
- A small loan, 200,000.

135
00:16:56,351 --> 00:16:59,003
Stephen. You've always spent money
as fast as you could make it

136
00:16:59,038 --> 00:17:01,198
but now you're spending money
you don't even have.

137
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,700
Maybe it's time to consider stopping.

138
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,600
No. Now is exactly the time not to stop.

139
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:10,099
Because, you see,
I'm not getting any better!

140
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,408
But this isn't medicine anymore.
This is mania.

141
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:16,450
Some things just can't be fixed.

142
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,479
Life without my work...
- Is still life.

143
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,700
This isn't the end. There are other things
that can give your life meaning.

144
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:25,400
Like what? Like you?

145
00:17:27,457 --> 00:17:29,800
And this is the part where you apologize.

146
00:17:29,868 --> 00:17:32,000
This is the part where you leave.

147
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,199
Fine. I can't watch you
do this to yourself anymore.

148
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,090
Too difficult for you, is it?
- Yes.

149
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,100
It is. And it breaks my heart to see
you this way.  - No. Don't pity me.

150
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:45,703
I'm not pitying you.  - Oh yeah?
Then what are you doing here?

151
00:17:45,704 --> 00:17:48,198
Bringing cheese and wine as if we're
old friends going for a picnic?

152
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:50,209
We are not friends, Christine.
We were barely lovers.

153
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:54,200
You just love a sob story, don't you?
Is that what I am to you now?

154
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:56,840
Poor Stephen Strange, charity case.

155
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:59,460
He finally needs me. Another dreg
of humanity for you to work on.

156
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:03,210
Fix him up and send him back into
the world, heart is just humming...

157
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:06,500
You care so much! Don't you?!?

158
00:18:10,984 --> 00:18:12,767
Goodbye, Stephen.

162
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:13,546
You talk a lot!

00:19:19,804 --> 00:19:22,450
Who are you?  - Paralyzed
from the mid-chest down.

165
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:24,190
Partial paralysis of both hands.

166
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,200
I don't know you.

167
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:29,500
I'm Stephen Strange. I'm a
neurosurgeon. Was a neurosurgeon.

168
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:33,100
Actually, you know what, man?
I think I know you.

169
00:19:33,141 --> 00:19:36,172
I came to your office once.
You refused to see me.

170
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:37,988
I never got past your assistant.

171
00:19:39,257 --> 00:19:43,111
You were untreatable.
- No glory for you in that, right?

172
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:48,199
You came back from a place
there is no way back from!

173
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,350
I... I'm trying to find my own way back.

174
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,400
Hey, Pangborn, you in it or not?

175
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,620
Alright.

176
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,000
I'd given up on my body.

177
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:17,000
I thought my mind was the only thing I had left.
I should at least try to elevate that.

178
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,500
So I sat with gurus, and sacred women.

179
00:20:20,582 --> 00:20:23,731
Strangers carried me to mountain tops
to see holy men.

180
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:26,750
And finally, I found my teacher.

181
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:32,000
And my mind was elevated.
And my spirit deepened.

182
00:20:32,654 --> 00:20:35,612
And somehow...
- Your body healed.  - Yes.

183
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,949
And there were deeper secrets to learn then,

184
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,910
but I did not have the strength
to receive them.

185
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:44,920
I chose to settle for my miracle,
and I came back home.

186
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,790
The place you're looking for
is called Kamar-Taj.

187
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,450
But the cost is high.
- How much?

188
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,900
I'm not talking about money.

189
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:01,620
Good luck.

190
00:21:02,673 --> 00:21:04,373
Give me the ball!

191
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,500
<font color="#fdff44"><b></b></font>

192
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,799
Excuse me. Kamar-Taj?

193
00:21:28,624 --> 00:21:30,500
Do you know where Kamar-Taj is?

194
00:21:43,162 --> 00:21:45,574
<font color="#fdff44"><i>Sign: "Himalayan Healing!
Find Peace! Find Yourself!"</i></font>

195
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:55,892
Kamar-Taj?

196
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,660
Kamar-Taj...

197
00:22:27,077 --> 00:22:28,777
Okay.

198
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:34,952
Guys, I... I don't have
any money.  - Your watch.

199
00:22:35,003 --> 00:22:40,099
No, please. It's all I
have left.  - Your watch.

200
00:22:42,637 --> 00:22:44,337
Alright.

201
00:23:24,346 --> 00:23:26,407
You're looking for Kamar-Taj?

202
00:23:57,199 --> 00:24:00,200
Really? Are you sure
you got the right place?

203
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:04,405
That one looks a little more...
Kamar-y Taj-y.

204
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,199
I once stood in your place.

205
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:13,700
And I, too, was... disrespectful.

206
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,199
So might I offer you some advice?

207
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,700
Forget everything you think you know.

208
00:24:23,115 --> 00:24:25,199
Uh... alright.

209
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,400
The sanctuary of our teacher.
The Ancient One.

210
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:40,767
The Ancient One?
What's his real name?

211
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,700
Right. Forget everything I
think I know. I'm sorry.

212
00:24:56,627 --> 00:24:58,327
Thank you for... huh!

213
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,196
Okay, that's, uh... a thing...

214
00:25:03,389 --> 00:25:05,089
Thank you.

215
00:25:05,122 --> 00:25:06,915
Hello.

216
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,500
Uh, thank you.
And thank you.

217
00:25:10,997 --> 00:25:15,450
Uh, thank you, Ancient One...
for... seeing me...

218
00:25:15,451 --> 00:25:16,900
You're very welcome.

219
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,503
The Ancient One.  - Thank you,
Master Mordo. Thank you, Master Hamir!

220
00:25:24,514 --> 00:25:26,214
Mr. Strange!

221
00:25:26,297 --> 00:25:30,840
Doctor, actually.  - Well, no.
Not anymore, surely.

222
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:35,400
Isn't that why you're here?
You've undergone many procedures.

223
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:36,900
Seven, right?
- Yeah...

224
00:25:38,932 --> 00:25:40,632
Good tea.

225
00:25:45,221 --> 00:25:49,030
Did you heal a man named
Pangborn? A paralyzed man.

226
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:52,400
In a way.  - You helped
him to walk again.

227
00:25:53,143 --> 00:25:58,000
Yes.  - How do you correct a
complete C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

228
00:25:58,001 --> 00:26:00,400
Oh, I didn't correct it.

229
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:02,700
He couldn't walk;
I convinced him that he could.

230
00:26:02,701 --> 00:26:04,868
You're not suggesting
it was psychosomatic?

231
00:26:04,907 --> 00:26:09,100
When you reattach a severed nerve, is it you
who heals it back together or the body?

232
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:14,800
It's the cells. - And the cells are only programmed
to put themselves together in very specific ways.

233
00:26:14,801 --> 00:26:18,198
That's right. - What if I told you
that your own body could be convinced

234
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:21,900
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

235
00:26:22,093 --> 00:26:25,199
You're talking about
cellular regeneration.

236
00:26:25,494 --> 00:26:28,221
That's... bleeding-edge medical tech.

237
00:26:28,222 --> 00:26:31,490
Is that why you're working here,
without a governing medical board?

238
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:33,791
I mean... just how experimental
is your treatment?

239
00:26:35,054 --> 00:26:36,754
Quite.

240
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:42,100
So, you figured out a way to
reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

241
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,537
No, Mr. Strange.

242
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:49,199
I know how to reorient the spirit
to better heal the body.

243
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:54,400
Spirit... to heal the body.

244
00:26:56,166 --> 00:27:00,400
Huh. A... al... al... alright.
How do we do that? Where do we start?

245
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,200
Don't like that map?

246
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:14,100
Oh, no. It's... it's very good. It's just...
you know, I've seen it before. In gift shops.

247
00:27:14,498 --> 00:27:19,199
And what about this one?
- Acupuncture, great.  - Yeah?

248
00:27:19,902 --> 00:27:21,800
What about... that one?

249
00:27:21,801 --> 00:27:24,685
You're showing me an MRI scan?
I can not believe this.

250
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,640
Each of those maps was drawn up by someone
who could see in part, but not the whole.

251
00:27:29,646 --> 00:27:32,530
I spent my last dollar getting here

252
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:35,930
on a one-way ticket, and you're talking
to me about healing through belief?

253
00:27:35,938 --> 00:27:38,700
You're a man who's looking
at the world through a keyhole,

254
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:41,523
and you spent your whole life
trying to widen that keyhole.

255
00:27:41,525 --> 00:27:46,380
To see more, know more. And now,
on hearing that it can be widened

256
00:27:46,382 --> 00:27:50,000
in ways you can't imagine,
you reject the possibility?

257
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:56,050
No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales
about chakras, or energy, or the power of belief.

258
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:58,660
There is no such thing as spirit!

259
00:27:58,672 --> 00:28:02,000
We are made of matter, and nothing more.

260
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:06,640
We're just another tiny, momentary speck
within an indifferent universe.

261
00:28:06,642 --> 00:28:10,350
You think too little of yourself.
- Oh, you think you see through me, do you?

262
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:14,720
Well, you don't. But I see through you!!!

263
00:28:32,196 --> 00:28:36,158
What did you just do to me?!?  - I pushed
your astral form out of your physical form.

264
00:28:36,193 --> 00:28:39,420
What's in that tea? Psilocybin? LSD?

265
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,226
Just tea.

266
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,050
With a little honey.

267
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:47,150
What just happened?  - For a moment,
you entered the astral dimension.

268
00:28:47,152 --> 00:28:50,900
What??  - A place where the soul
exists apart from the body.

269
00:28:50,901 --> 00:28:56,199
Why are you doing this to me?
- To show you just how much you don't know.

270
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,450
Open your eye.

271
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,900
No! No... No! Shit!

272
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:10,043
Oh god! Oh god! Oh god!

273
00:29:11,031 --> 00:29:13,044
This isn't real it isn't real it isn't

274
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:25,837
<b><i>His pulse is reaching dangerous levels.</i></b>

275
00:29:31,221 --> 00:29:32,921
He looks alright to me.

276
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,000
You think you know how the world works?

277
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:41,700
You think that this material
universe is all there is?

278
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,700
What is real?

279
00:29:49,898 --> 00:29:53,000
What mysteries lie beyond
the reach of your senses?

280
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:59,683
At the root of existence,
mind and matter meet.

281
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,700
Thoughts create reality.

282
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,100
This universe is only one
of an infinite number.

283
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:24,400
Worlds without end.

284
00:30:25,428 --> 00:30:28,199
Some benevolent and life-giving;

285
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:34,199
others filled with malice and hunger.

286
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:43,400
Dark places, where powers
older than time lie...

287
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:46,909
ravenous... and waiting.

288
00:30:53,843 --> 00:31:00,099
Who are you in this vast multiverse,
Mr. Strange?

289
00:31:20,199 --> 00:31:23,400
Have you seen that before in a gift shop?

290
00:31:30,201 --> 00:31:31,901
Teach me!

291
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,720
No.

292
00:31:40,624 --> 00:31:42,324
No... No!

293
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:44,850
No, no, no, no no no no!

294
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:51,000
No! Open the door! Please!

295
00:31:54,006 --> 00:31:55,706
Thank you, Masters.

296
00:32:00,215 --> 00:32:03,000
You think I'm wrong to cast him out?

297
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:05,700
5 hours later, he's still on your doorstep.

298
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:08,482
There's a strength to him.

299
00:32:08,483 --> 00:32:13,410
Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition...
I've seen it all before.

300
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,000
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

301
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:18,840
I can not lead another
gifted student to power,

302
00:32:18,841 --> 00:32:20,950
only to lose him to the darkness.

303
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:27,338
You didn't lose me. I wanted
the power to defeat my enemies.

304
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:31,100
You gave me the power
to defeat my demons.

305
00:32:31,101 --> 00:32:34,400
And to live within the natural law.

306
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:36,700
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

307
00:32:37,503 --> 00:32:39,500
We only learn to live above them.

308
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:45,100
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

309
00:32:45,181 --> 00:32:48,600
If he deciphers them,
he could bring ruin upon us all.

310
00:32:49,853 --> 00:32:51,750
There may be dark days ahead.

311
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,350
Perhaps Kamar-Taj could
use a man like Strange.

312
00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:07,100
Don't shut me out.

313
00:33:10,231 --> 00:33:13,100
I've nowhere else to go.

314
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:18,906
Thank you.

315
00:33:23,382 --> 00:33:25,082
Bed.

316
00:33:25,748 --> 00:33:27,448
Rest.

317
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,420
Meditate...

318
00:33:29,483 --> 00:33:31,183
if you can.

319
00:33:31,474 --> 00:33:33,480
The Ancient One will send for you.

320
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,500
Uh, what's this? My mantra?

321
00:33:45,017 --> 00:33:47,000
The Wi-Fi password.

322
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,700
We're not savages.

323
00:34:10,391 --> 00:34:13,729
<font color="#fdff44"><i>Time will tell how much I love you.</i>

324
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:14,720
<i>Christine</i></font>

325
00:34:21,363 --> 00:34:25,550
The language of the mystic arts
is as old as civilization.

326
00:34:26,618 --> 00:34:31,199
The sorcerers of antiquity called
the use of this language "spells".

327
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,700
But if that word offends
your modern sensibilities,

328
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:36,114
you can call it "program".

329
00:34:36,538 --> 00:34:39,450
The source code that shapes reality.

330
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:42,750
We harness energy

331
00:34:43,841 --> 00:34:46,900
drawn from other dimensions
of the multiverse,

332
00:34:48,385 --> 00:34:50,150
to cast spells,

333
00:34:51,732 --> 00:34:54,199
conjure shields

334
00:34:54,618 --> 00:34:56,400
and weapons

335
00:34:57,497 --> 00:34:59,550
to make magic.

336
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,199
But... even if my fingers could do that,

337
00:35:17,547 --> 00:35:20,800
My hands would just be
waving in the air. I mean,

338
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,900
how do I get from here to there?

339
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:25,410
How did you get to
reattach severed nerves,

340
00:35:25,411 --> 00:35:29,380
and put a human spine
back together bone by bone?

341
00:35:29,381 --> 00:35:31,700
Study and practice. Years of it.

342
00:35:40,287 --> 00:35:41,987
Hey.

343
00:35:44,873 --> 00:35:48,050
Mr. Strange.
- Uh... Stephen, please.

344
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:51,111
- And you are?
- Wong. - Wong.

345
00:35:52,187 --> 00:35:55,099
Just Wong? Like... Adele?

346
00:35:57,279 --> 00:35:59,050
Or... Aristotle.

347
00:36:00,466 --> 00:36:02,900
Drake. Bono.

348
00:36:05,682 --> 00:36:07,500
Eminem.

349
00:36:10,575 --> 00:36:12,500
The book of the invisible sun.

350
00:36:13,307 --> 00:36:15,090
Astronomia Nova.

351
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:17,192
Codex Imperium.

352
00:36:17,496 --> 00:36:19,250
Key of Solomon.

353
00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:23,590
You finished all of this?
- Yup.

354
00:36:24,635 --> 00:36:26,980
Come with me.
- Alright.

355
00:36:28,024 --> 00:36:30,111
This section is for Masters only.

356
00:36:30,113 --> 00:36:32,490
But at my discretion,
others may use it.

357
00:36:33,643 --> 00:36:35,490
We should start with Maxim's Primer.

358
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,050
How is your Sanskrit?

359
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:44,090
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

360
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:47,400
Read it. Classical Sanskrit.

361
00:36:51,729 --> 00:36:53,500
What are those?

362
00:36:53,525 --> 00:36:55,900
The Ancient One's private collection.

363
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:58,181
So they're forbidden?

364
00:36:58,231 --> 00:37:01,820
No knowledge in Kamar-Taj is forbidden.
Only certain practices.

365
00:37:04,245 --> 00:37:08,380
Those books are far too advanced for
anyone other than the Sorcerer Supreme.

366
00:37:19,453 --> 00:37:21,250
This one's got pages missing.

367
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:25,280
That's the book of Cagliostro.
The study of time.

368
00:37:25,705 --> 00:37:28,320
One of the rituals was
stolen by a former Master.

369
00:37:29,744 --> 00:37:32,000
A zealot called Kaecilius.

370
00:37:33,566 --> 00:37:36,195
Just after he strung up
the former librarian,

371
00:37:36,196 --> 00:37:38,660
and relieved him of his head.

372
00:37:41,511 --> 00:37:43,600
I'm now the guardian of these books.

373
00:37:44,142 --> 00:37:48,800
So if a volume from this collection
should be stolen again, I'd know it.

374
00:37:48,804 --> 00:37:52,150
And you'd be dead before
you ever left the compound.

375
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:57,699
What if it's just overdue? You know?

376
00:37:58,081 --> 00:38:01,299
Any... late fees I should know about?
Maybe, perhaps, uhm...

377
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,201
Uh, you know, people used
to think that I was funny.

378
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,700
Did they work for you?

379
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:14,890
Alright. Well, it's been lovely talking to you,
thank you for the books and for the horrifying story

380
00:38:14,891 --> 00:38:17,711
and for the threat upon my life.

381
00:38:48,072 --> 00:38:51,620
Now we receive the power to destroy
the one who betrayed us.

382
00:38:54,217 --> 00:38:56,250
The one who betrays the world.

383
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:59,280
Mastery of the sling ring is
essential to the mystic arts.

384
00:39:59,723 --> 00:40:02,550
They allow us to travel
throughout the multiverse.

385
00:40:03,022 --> 00:40:05,199
All you need to do is focus.

386
00:40:05,442 --> 00:40:07,199
Visualize.

387
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:09,750
See the destination in your mind.

388
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:13,420
Look beyond the world in front of you.

389
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:16,660
Imagine every detail.

390
00:40:17,552 --> 00:40:22,199
The clearer the picture,
the quicker, and easier,

391
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:24,320
the gateway will come.

392
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:29,150
And stop.

393
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,390
I'd like a moment alone
with Mr. Strange.

394
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:34,090
Of course.

395
00:40:37,343 --> 00:40:40,399
My hands.  - It's not
about your hands.

396
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,199
How is this not about my hands?

397
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:43,950
Master Hamir.

398
00:40:57,743 --> 00:40:59,499
Thank you, Master Hamir.

399
00:41:00,483 --> 00:41:02,700
You cannot beat a river into submission.

400
00:41:03,687 --> 00:41:08,110
You have to surrender to its current,
and use its power as your own.

401
00:41:08,414 --> 00:41:11,552
I... I control it by surrendering control?
That doesn't make any sense.

402
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:14,760
Not everything does.
Not everything has to.

403
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,890
Your intellect has
taken you far in life.

404
00:41:17,899 --> 00:41:19,629
But it will take you no further.

405
00:41:19,718 --> 00:41:21,460
Surrender, Stephen.

406
00:41:22,004 --> 00:41:23,720
Silence your ego

407
00:41:24,324 --> 00:41:26,060
and your power will rise.

408
00:41:26,939 --> 00:41:28,655
Follow me.

409
00:41:33,572 --> 00:41:35,925
Wait. Is this...
- Everest.

410
00:41:38,071 --> 00:41:44,460
It's beautiful.  - Yeah, you're right.
Beautiful. It's freezing, but... beautiful.

411
00:41:44,531 --> 00:41:48,700
At this temperature,
a person can last for 13 minutes

412
00:41:48,701 --> 00:41:52,200
before suffering permanent
loss of function.  - Great.

413
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:57,200
But you will likely go into shock
within the first 2 minutes.  - What?

414
00:41:57,201 --> 00:42:00,199
Surrender, Stephen.
- No, no!!! Don't!

415
00:42:09,249 --> 00:42:12,350
How is our new recruit?
- We shall see.

416
00:42:12,857 --> 00:42:14,600
Any second now.

417
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,580
No, not again.

418
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:25,250
Maybe I should...

419
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,960
Stephen.
- Wong.

420
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:44,080
What do you want, Strange?
- Books on astral projection.

421
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:47,570
You're not ready for that.
- Try me, Beyoncé.

422
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,560
Come on. You've heard of her.
She's a huge star, right?

423
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,350
Do you ever laugh?

424
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,870
Oh come on, just
give me the book, huh?

425
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,185
No.

426
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:34,750
Once, in this room,
you begged me to let you learn.

427
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:39,100
Now I'm told you question every lesson,
prefering to teach yourself.

428
00:44:39,101 --> 00:44:42,000
Once, in this room,
you told me to open my eyes.

429
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:44,790
Now I'm being told to blindly
accept rules that make no sense.

430
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:48,199
Like the rule against conjuring
a gateway in the library?

431
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,700
Wong told on me?  - You're advancing
quickly with your sorcery skills.

432
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:54,910
You need a safe space
to practice your spells.

433
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,420
You are now inside the Mirror Dimension.

434
00:45:15,775 --> 00:45:17,800
ever present but undetected.

435
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:21,303
The real world isn't affected
by what happens here.

436
00:45:22,103 --> 00:45:25,571
We use the Mirror Dimension
to train, surveil,

437
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,741
and sometimes to contain threats.

438
00:45:28,951 --> 00:45:31,653
You don't want to be stuck
in here without your sling ring.

439
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:34,652
Hold on. Sorry, what
do you mean, threats?

440
00:45:44,013 --> 00:45:46,285
Learning of an infinite multiverse

441
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:48,587
included learning of infinite dangers.

442
00:45:48,622 --> 00:45:53,037
And if I told you everything else that you don't
already know, you'd run from here in terror.

443
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:01,431
So, just how ancient is she?

444
00:46:03,882 --> 00:46:05,988
No one knows the age of the Sorcerer Supreme.

445
00:46:06,742 --> 00:46:10,052
Only that she is Celtic
and never talks about her past.

446
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,815
You follow her even though you don't know?

447
00:46:12,016 --> 00:46:13,734
I know that she's steadfast,
but unpredictable.

448
00:46:14,734 --> 00:46:16,330
Merciless, yet kind.

449
00:46:17,762 --> 00:46:19,462
She made me what I am.

450
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:24,700
Trust your teacher.
And don't lose your way.

451
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:27,359
Like Kaecilius?
- That's right.

452
00:46:32,574 --> 00:46:34,274
You knew him.

453
00:46:34,816 --> 00:46:38,217
When he first came to us,
he'd lost everyone he ever loved.

454
00:46:38,252 --> 00:46:39,965
He was a grieving and broken man,

455
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:42,261
searching for answers in the mystic arts.

456
00:46:42,296 --> 00:46:45,756
A brilliant student, but
he was proud, headstrong.

457
00:46:45,865 --> 00:46:48,441
Questioned the Ancient One,
rejected our teaching.

458
00:46:55,676 --> 00:46:57,376
He left Kamar-Taj.

459
00:46:57,591 --> 00:47:00,216
His disciples followed him like sheep

460
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:02,461
seduced by false doctrine.

461
00:47:02,496 --> 00:47:05,559
He stole the forbidden ritual, right?
- Yeah.

462
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,898
What did it do?

463
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:11,390
No more questions.

464
00:47:12,302 --> 00:47:14,721
What's that?
- That's a question.

465
00:47:16,394 --> 00:47:18,094
This is a relic.

466
00:47:18,364 --> 00:47:21,690
Some magic is too powerful to sustain,
so we imbue objects with it.

467
00:47:22,913 --> 00:47:25,203
allowing them to take the strain we can not.

468
00:47:25,374 --> 00:47:29,950
This is the Staff of the Living Tribunal.

469
00:47:33,546 --> 00:47:35,246
There are many relics.

470
00:47:35,262 --> 00:47:36,962
The Wand of Watoomb.

471
00:47:37,014 --> 00:47:38,741
The Bolting Boots of Voltor.

472
00:47:38,742 --> 00:47:42,877
They just roll of the tongue, don't they?
When do I get my relic?

473
00:47:42,878 --> 00:47:45,390
When you're ready.
- I think I'm ready.

474
00:47:45,425 --> 00:47:48,009
You're ready when the relic
decides you're ready.

475
00:47:48,796 --> 00:47:50,496
For now,

476
00:47:51,491 --> 00:47:53,191
conjure a weapon.

477
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,717
Yeah.

478
00:48:01,611 --> 00:48:05,552
Fight! Fight like
your life depended on it!

479
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,891
Because one day, it may.

480
00:48:34,263 --> 00:48:37,347
<font color="#fdff44"><i>Christine</i></font>

481
00:48:41,424 --> 00:48:46,000
<font color="#fdff44"><i>I'm emailing you one more time to</i></font>

482
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:26,341
Wong?

483
00:49:38,111 --> 00:49:39,811
Okay.

484
00:49:39,812 --> 00:49:42,829
First, open the Eye of Agamotto.

485
00:50:03,269 --> 00:50:04,969
Alright.

486
00:50:28,383 --> 00:50:30,083
Oh my.

487
00:51:06,984 --> 00:51:08,684
Dormammu.

488
00:51:10,153 --> 00:51:11,853
The Dark Dimension.

489
00:51:12,488 --> 00:51:14,188
Eternal life?

490
00:51:20,188 --> 00:51:21,888
Stop!!!

491
00:51:24,945 --> 00:51:27,189
Tampering with the continuum
of probability is forbidden!

492
00:51:27,224 --> 00:51:29,535
I... I wa... I was just doing
exactly what it said in the book!

493
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:32,869
And what did the book say about
the dangers of performing that ritual?

494
00:51:32,904 --> 00:51:34,771
Yeah, I don't know. I hadn't
gotten to that part yet.

495
00:51:34,788 --> 00:51:37,372
Temporal manipulations can
create branches in time.

496
00:51:38,018 --> 00:51:39,817
Unstable dimensional openings.

497
00:51:39,852 --> 00:51:42,694
Spacious paradoxes! Time loops!!!

498
00:51:42,743 --> 00:51:46,012
You want to get stuck reliving the
same moment over, and over, forever,

499
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,747
or never having existed at all?

500
00:51:48,699 --> 00:51:50,808
They really should put the
warnings before that stuff.

501
00:51:50,878 --> 00:51:52,785
Your curiosity could have gotten you killed.

502
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,375
You weren't manipulating
the space-time continuum,

503
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:57,505
you were wrecking it.

504
00:51:57,835 --> 00:52:01,281
We do not tamper with
natural law. We defend it.

505
00:52:01,294 --> 00:52:02,994
How did you learn to do that?

506
00:52:04,214 --> 00:52:07,122
Where did you learn the litany of spells
required to even understand it?

507
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:10,700
I've got a photographic memory. It's how I
got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time.

508
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:14,700
What you just did
takes more than a good memory.

509
00:52:14,701 --> 00:52:16,199
You were born for the mystic arts.

510
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:19,749
And yet, my hands still shake.
- For now, yes.

511
00:52:19,784 --> 00:52:22,316
Not forever?
- We're not prophets.

512
00:52:22,351 --> 00:52:24,530
When do you start telling me what we are?

513
00:52:29,935 --> 00:52:33,853
While heroes like the Avengers
protect the world from physical dangers,

514
00:52:34,262 --> 00:52:37,163
we sorcerers safeguard it
against more mystical threats.

515
00:52:38,581 --> 00:52:42,356
The Ancient One is the latest
in a long line of Sorcerers Supreme

516
00:52:42,391 --> 00:52:45,963
Going back thousands of years
to the father of the mystic arts,

517
00:52:45,998 --> 00:52:47,698
the mighty Agamotto.

518
00:52:48,641 --> 00:52:52,553
The same sorcerer who created the eye
you so recklessly borrowed.

519
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,917
Agamotto built 3 Sanctums in places of power,

520
00:52:56,952 --> 00:52:59,505
where great cities now stand.

521
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,596
That door leads to the Hong Kong Sanctum,

522
00:53:02,955 --> 00:53:04,655
that door to the New York Sanctum.

523
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:07,158
That one, to the London Sanctum.

524
00:53:07,509 --> 00:53:11,907
Together, the Sanctums generate a
protective shield around our world.

525
00:53:12,832 --> 00:53:16,296
The Sanctums protect the
world, and we sorcerers

526
00:53:16,703 --> 00:53:19,710
protect the Sanctums.
- From what?

527
00:53:19,745 --> 00:53:22,808
Other-dimensional beings
that threaten our universe.

528
00:53:23,651 --> 00:53:25,351
Like Dormammu?

529
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:27,836
Where did you learn that name?

530
00:53:28,781 --> 00:53:31,354
I just read it in the book
of Cagliostro. Why?

531
00:53:36,855 --> 00:53:38,555
Dormammu dwells in the Dark Dimension.

532
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:41,959
Beyond time.

533
00:53:42,332 --> 00:53:46,402
He is the cosmic conquerer,
the destroyer of worlds.

534
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:49,608
A being of infinite power
and endless hunger,

535
00:53:50,669 --> 00:53:52,680
on a quest to invade every universe

536
00:53:52,715 --> 00:53:55,575
and bring all worlds into
his Dark Dimension.

537
00:53:56,688 --> 00:53:59,012
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

538
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,340
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

539
00:54:02,986 --> 00:54:06,603
A ritual to contact Dormammu and
draw power from the Dark Dimension.

540
00:54:10,907 --> 00:54:12,607
Uuuh... okay. Okay.

541
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:18,613
I... time-out. I... I came
here to heal my hands,

542
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:23,038
not to fight in some mystical war.

543
00:54:25,399 --> 00:54:27,099
London.

544
00:54:30,387 --> 00:54:32,094
Kaecilius!

545
00:54:32,095 --> 00:54:33,795
No!!!

546
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:40,989
Wong? Mordo?

547
00:55:17,748 --> 00:55:19,448
<font color="#fdff44"><i>177A Bleecker Street</i></font>

548
00:55:32,036 --> 00:55:33,736
Hello?

549
00:56:02,601 --> 00:56:04,301
Hello?

550
00:56:42,344 --> 00:56:45,705
Daniel. I see they made you
Master of the Sanctum.

551
00:56:47,012 --> 00:56:48,712
Do you know what that means?

552
00:56:49,548 --> 00:56:51,248
That you'll die protecting it.

553
00:57:07,473 --> 00:57:09,173
Stop!

554
00:57:19,855 --> 00:57:22,104
How long have you been
at Kamar-TaJ, Mister...?

555
00:57:22,388 --> 00:57:24,088
Doctor.

556
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:28,143
Just Doctor?  - It's Strange.

557
00:57:29,555 --> 00:57:32,447
Maybe. Who am I to judge?

558
00:59:57,075 --> 00:59:59,062
You don't know how to use that, do you?

559
01:01:44,164 --> 01:01:45,864
What?

560
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,700
You'll die here.
- Oh, stop it.

561
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:53,254
I said, stop it!

562
01:01:53,289 --> 01:01:56,737
You cannot stop this, Mr. Doctor.  - Why...
look, I don't even know what "this" is.

563
01:01:57,373 --> 01:02:00,431
It's the end and the beginning.

564
01:02:00,489 --> 01:02:03,085
The many becoming the few,
becoming the One.

565
01:02:04,878 --> 01:02:08,200
Look, if you're not going to start making sense,
I'm just going to have to put this thing back on.

566
01:02:08,201 --> 01:02:09,375
Tell me, Mr. Doctor.

567
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:12,595
Alright, look. My name
is Dr. Stephen Strange.

568
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:15,808
You are a doctor?
- Yes.  - A scientist.

569
01:02:16,467 --> 01:02:21,322
You understand the laws of nature.
All things age. All things die.

570
01:02:21,545 --> 01:02:25,060
In the end, our sun burns out,
our universe grows cold and perishes.

571
01:02:25,941 --> 01:02:27,737
But the Dark Dimension...

572
01:02:28,133 --> 01:02:29,845
it's a place beyond time.

573
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,306
That's it. I'm putting this thing back on.
This world doesn't have to die, Doctor.

574
01:02:33,341 --> 01:02:36,274
This world can take its rightful
place among so many others,

575
01:02:36,309 --> 01:02:38,009
as part of the One.

576
01:02:38,256 --> 01:02:39,956
The great and beautiful One.

577
01:02:40,939 --> 01:02:42,639
And we can all live forever.

578
01:02:42,953 --> 01:02:44,653
Really?

579
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:49,708
What do you have to gain out of
this New Age dimensional utopia?

580
01:02:50,541 --> 01:02:54,132
The same as you. The same as
everyone. Life. Eternal life.

581
01:02:55,232 --> 01:02:57,243
People think in terms of good and evil,

582
01:02:57,278 --> 01:03:00,651
but really, time is the true enemy
of us all. Time kills everything.

583
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:02,550
What about the people you killed?

584
01:03:02,585 --> 01:03:06,684
Tiny, momentary specks within
an indifferent universe.

585
01:03:08,648 --> 01:03:10,348
Yes. You see,

586
01:03:11,342 --> 01:03:13,175
you see what we're doing?

587
01:03:14,118 --> 01:03:17,881
The world is not what it ought to be.
Humanity longs for the eternal,

588
01:03:18,338 --> 01:03:20,775
for a world beyond time, because
time is what enslaves us.

589
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:22,948
Time is an insult.

590
01:03:23,569 --> 01:03:25,432
Death is an insult.

591
01:03:26,478 --> 01:03:28,178
Doctor...

592
01:03:28,749 --> 01:03:30,936
We don't seek to rule this world.

593
01:03:30,971 --> 01:03:33,859
We seek to save it, to
hand it over to Dormammu,

594
01:03:33,894 --> 01:03:36,444
who is the intent of all evolution,

595
01:03:37,206 --> 01:03:38,906
the Why of all existence.

596
01:03:39,971 --> 01:03:42,688
The Sorcerer Supreme defends existence.

597
01:03:44,325 --> 01:03:48,361
What was it that brought you to Kamar-Taj,
Doctor? Was it enlightenment?

598
01:03:49,071 --> 01:03:50,771
Power?

599
01:03:52,044 --> 01:03:54,383
You came to be healed, as did we all.

600
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,053
Kamar-Taj is a place that
collects broken things.

601
01:03:59,058 --> 01:04:00,886
We all come with the
promise of being healed,

602
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:03,666
but instead, the Ancient One
gives us parlor tricks.

603
01:04:05,207 --> 01:04:07,350
The real magic she keeps for herself.

604
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:10,756
Have you ever wondered how she
managed to live this long?

605
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,371
I... I saw the rituals in
the book of Cagliostro.

606
01:04:18,406 --> 01:04:21,032
So, you know.

607
01:04:21,067 --> 01:04:26,176
The ritual gives me the power to overthrow
the Ancient One and tear her Sanctums down,

608
01:04:26,211 --> 01:04:28,691
to let the Dark Dimension in.

609
01:04:29,247 --> 01:04:32,602
Because what the Ancient One
hoards, Dormammu gives freely.

610
01:04:33,806 --> 01:04:35,506
Life, everlasting.

611
01:04:36,148 --> 01:04:39,472
He is not the destroyer of worlds,
Doctor, he is the savior of worlds.

612
01:04:41,366 --> 01:04:44,200
No. I mean, come on.
Look at your face.

613
01:04:44,899 --> 01:04:47,084
Dormammu made you a murderer.

614
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:49,754
Just how good can his kingdom be?

615
01:04:51,603 --> 01:04:53,303
You think that's funny?

616
01:04:53,578 --> 01:04:55,278
No. No, Doctor.

617
01:04:55,407 --> 01:04:57,965
What's funny is that you've
lost your sling ring.

618
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:08,591
Sir, can I help you?
- Dr. Palmer, where is she?

619
01:06:08,693 --> 01:06:11,583
Sir, we need to...  - Where is she?
- At the nurses station.

620
01:06:11,755 --> 01:06:13,455
Christine!

621
01:06:15,052 --> 01:06:19,967
Stephen? Oh my god. What...  - We need to
get me on an operation table now. Just you.

622
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:21,840
Now! I don't have any time!

623
01:06:22,192 --> 01:06:25,696
What happened?
- Stabbed. Cardiac tamponade.

624
01:06:27,075 --> 01:06:28,775
What are you wearing?

625
01:06:34,989 --> 01:06:39,737
The chest cavity is clear.
- The blood... is in the pericardial sac.

626
01:06:41,809 --> 01:06:44,114
No. No no no no no no no!
Stephen! Stephen!

627
01:06:46,018 --> 01:06:47,718


628
01:07:12,694 --> 01:07:14,394
Just a little higher.

629
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,660
Please be careful with the needle.

630
01:07:19,492 --> 01:07:21,192
Stephen?

631
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:25,963
Oh lord, oh lord. What am I seeing?
- My astral body.

632
01:07:27,447 --> 01:07:30,303
Are you dead?
- No, Christine, but I am dying.

633
01:07:32,646 --> 01:07:34,776
Right. Right.

634
01:07:36,121 --> 01:07:39,498
Yeah. Alright.

635
01:07:48,605 --> 01:07:50,325
I've... I've never seen
a wound like this before.

636
01:07:50,852 --> 01:07:52,552
What were you stabbed with?

637
01:07:52,993 --> 01:07:54,693
I don't know.

638
01:08:13,764 --> 01:08:16,466
I'm going to have to
vanish now.  - No, I...

639
01:08:17,008 --> 01:08:18,708
Keep me alive, will you?

640
01:08:21,782 --> 01:08:23,673
Okay! Okay.

641
01:08:48,335 --> 01:08:50,035
Bullshit!

642
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:22,024
<font color="#fdff44"><i>Charging to 200 Joule</i></font>

643
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:34,786
Stephen, come on.

644
01:09:37,255 --> 01:09:40,124
Hit me again!
- Stop doing that!

645
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:42,004
Up the voltage and hit me again.

646
01:09:42,005 --> 01:09:44,350
No, your heart is beating!
- Just do it!

647
01:09:46,510 --> 01:09:48,210


648
01:09:53,179 --> 01:09:54,879


649
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,860
Oh god!

650
01:10:17,961 --> 01:10:19,731
Are you ok?
- Yeah.

651
01:10:21,191 --> 01:10:22,891
Okay.

652
01:10:28,163 --> 01:10:31,809
After all this time,
you just show up here,

653
01:10:33,693 --> 01:10:37,247
flying out of your body?
- Yeah, I know.

654
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,660
I missed you too, by the way.

655
01:10:41,356 --> 01:10:43,806
I wrote 2 emails, but
you never responded.

656
01:10:43,841 --> 01:10:45,541
Why would I?

657
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:48,423
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

658
01:10:49,696 --> 01:10:51,398
For all of it.
And you were right,

659
01:10:51,433 --> 01:10:55,253
I was a complete asshole.
I treated you so horribly

660
01:10:55,288 --> 01:10:59,482
and you deserved so much more.
- Stop. You... you're clearly in shock.

661
01:11:01,271 --> 01:11:02,971
I mean, what the hell is happening?

662
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,600
Where have you been?

663
01:11:05,865 --> 01:11:09,050
Well, after Western medicine failed me,

664
01:11:09,085 --> 01:11:12,000
I headed East, and I
wound up in Kathmandu.

665
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:14,510
Kathmandu?
- Yeah.

666
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:19,603
What, like the Bob Seger song?
- 1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. And then,

667
01:11:19,638 --> 01:11:21,400
I went to a place called Kamar-Taj

668
01:11:21,401 --> 01:11:26,816
and I talked to someone
called the Ancient One, and...

669
01:11:28,098 --> 01:11:31,302
Oh. So you joined a cult.
- No, I didn't. Not exactly. I mean,

670
01:11:31,337 --> 01:11:34,411
they did teach me to tap into powers
that I never even knew existed.

671
01:11:34,446 --> 01:11:36,761
Yeah, that sounds like a cult.
- It's not a cult.

672
01:11:37,033 --> 01:11:40,069
Well, that's what a cultist
would say.  - Oh, no.

673
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:43,079
Wait, Stephen... what do
you think you're doing?

674
01:11:43,114 --> 01:11:44,814
I'm late for a cult meeting.

675
01:11:48,934 --> 01:11:50,734
This is insane.
- Yeah.

676
01:11:50,769 --> 01:11:52,775
Where are you going?

677
01:11:53,181 --> 01:11:54,884
Uhm...
- Just tell me the truth?

678
01:11:54,885 --> 01:11:59,023
Well, a powerful sorcerer, who gave
himself over to an ancient entity

679
01:11:59,031 --> 01:12:01,691
who can bend the very laws of physics,
tried very hard to kill me,

680
01:12:01,696 --> 01:12:03,658
but I left him chained up
in Greenwich Village,

681
01:12:03,663 --> 01:12:05,786
and the quickest way back there
is through a dimensional gateway

682
01:12:05,787 --> 01:12:09,911
that I opened up in the mop closet.
- Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.

683
01:12:20,395 --> 01:12:22,378
I really do have to go.

684
01:12:23,045 --> 01:12:24,745


685
01:13:09,661 --> 01:13:11,361
Strange!

686
01:13:13,468 --> 01:13:17,149
You're okay.  - A relative term,
but yeah, I'm okay.

687
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:19,680
The Cloak of Levitation.

688
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,400
It came to you.

689
01:13:22,836 --> 01:13:24,536
No minor feat.

690
01:13:25,225 --> 01:13:26,925
It's a fickle thing.

691
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:29,156
He's escaped.
- Kaecilius?  - Yeah.

692
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:32,957
He can fold space and matter at will.

693
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:38,318
He folds matter outside the mirror
dimension? In the real world?  - Yeah.

694
01:13:38,843 --> 01:13:40,653
How many more?
- Two.

695
01:13:41,819 --> 01:13:46,345
I stranded one in the desert.
- And the other?  - His body was in the hall.

696
01:13:46,346 --> 01:13:50,143
Master Drumm was in the foyer.
- He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

697
01:13:50,144 --> 01:13:51,844
The London Sanctum has fallen.

698
01:13:52,473 --> 01:13:56,658
Only New York and Hong Kong remain now
to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

699
01:13:57,635 --> 01:13:59,886
You defended the New York Sanctum from attack.

700
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:02,434
With its Master gone, it needs another,

701
01:14:02,469 --> 01:14:04,449
Master Strange.

702
01:14:06,926 --> 01:14:08,626
No.

703
01:14:09,092 --> 01:14:10,999
It is Dr. Strange.

704
01:14:11,034 --> 01:14:13,339
Not Master Strange, not Mr. Strange,

705
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:15,279
Doctor Strange.

706
01:14:16,539 --> 01:14:19,883
When I became a doctor,
I swore an oath to do no harm.

707
01:14:19,918 --> 01:14:22,985
And I have just killed a man!
I'm not doing that again.

708
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:25,668
I became a doctor to save
lives, not take them.

709
01:14:25,703 --> 01:14:29,832
You become a doctor to save
one life above all others.

710
01:14:29,888 --> 01:14:31,661
Your own.

711
01:14:31,696 --> 01:14:35,464
Still seeing through me, are you?
- I see what I've always seen.

712
01:14:35,499 --> 01:14:37,653
Your overinflated ego.

713
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:40,857
You want to go back to the delusion
that you can control anything,

714
01:14:41,437 --> 01:14:44,429
even death, which no one can control.

715
01:14:44,464 --> 01:14:47,152
Not even the great doctor
Stephen Strange.

716
01:14:47,568 --> 01:14:49,778
Not even Dormammu?

717
01:14:51,212 --> 01:14:52,912
He offers immortality.

718
01:14:53,177 --> 01:14:55,149
It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.

719
01:14:55,184 --> 01:14:58,526
He feeds off it.
- Like you feed on him?

720
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:02,018
You talk to me about controlling death.
Well, I know how you do it.

721
01:15:02,053 --> 01:15:05,039
I've seen the missing rituals
from the book of Cagliostro.

722
01:15:06,088 --> 01:15:09,260
Measure your next words
very carefully, doctor.

723
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:11,151
Because you might not like them?

724
01:15:11,186 --> 01:15:13,899
Because you may not know
of what you speak.

725
01:15:13,934 --> 01:15:16,673
What is he talking about?
- I'm talking about her long life.

726
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:18,683
The source of her immortality.

727
01:15:21,026 --> 01:15:23,840
She draws power from the
Dark Dimension to stay alive.

728
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:29,599
That's not true.  - I've seen
the rituals and worked them out.

729
01:15:30,515 --> 01:15:32,215
I know how you do it.

730
01:15:33,564 --> 01:15:36,455
Once they regroup,
the zealots will be back.

731
01:15:37,562 --> 01:15:39,262
You'll need reinforcements.

732
01:15:46,773 --> 01:15:50,502
She is not who you think she is.
- You don't have the right to say that.

733
01:15:50,537 --> 01:15:55,214
You have no idea of the responsibility that rests
upon her shoulders.  - No, and I don't want to know.

734
01:15:55,579 --> 01:15:56,200
You're a coward.  - Because I'm not a killer?

735
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,692
- These zealots will snuff us all out,

736
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:02,759
and you can muster the strength
to snuff them out first?

737
01:16:02,794 --> 01:16:05,745
What do you think I just did?
- You saved your own life!

738
01:16:06,651 --> 01:16:10,803
And then whined about it like a wounded dog.
- When you would have done it so easily?

739
01:16:10,838 --> 01:16:13,818
You have no idea.
The things I've done...

740
01:16:15,502 --> 01:16:17,202
And the answer is yes.

741
01:16:17,733 --> 01:16:20,739
Without hesitation.
- Even if there's another way?

742
01:16:20,774 --> 01:16:24,200
There is no other way.
- You lack imagination.

743
01:16:24,201 --> 01:16:29,168
No, Stephen. You lack a spine.

744
01:16:34,247 --> 01:16:35,947
They're back.

745
01:16:42,259 --> 01:16:44,216
We have to end this. Right now!

746
01:16:50,067 --> 01:16:52,683
Strange! Get down here and fight!

747
01:16:53,617 --> 01:16:55,317


748
01:16:58,907 --> 01:17:00,607
The Mirror Dimension.

749
01:17:00,819 --> 01:17:03,013
You can't affect the
real world in here.

750
01:17:03,589 --> 01:17:06,444
Who's laughing now, asshole?

751
01:17:08,653 --> 01:17:10,353
I am.

752
01:17:23,223 --> 01:17:25,713
They've got no sling ring. I mean,
they can't escape, right?

753
01:17:27,098 --> 01:17:28,798
Trei!

754
01:17:44,989 --> 01:17:48,657
Their connection to the Dark Dimension makes
them more powerful in the Mirror Dimension.

755
01:17:48,692 --> 01:17:51,651
They can't affect the real world,
but they can still kill us.

756
01:17:51,657 --> 01:17:53,963
This wasn't clever. This was suicide!

757
01:18:10,751 --> 01:18:12,451
That is hilarious.

758
01:18:59,089 --> 01:19:00,789
This was a mistake.

759
01:20:33,168 --> 01:20:34,868
It's true.

760
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:38,209
She does draw power from the Dark Dimension.

761
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:44,008
Kaecilius.

762
01:20:46,109 --> 01:20:49,182
I came to you, broken,

763
01:20:49,348 --> 01:20:51,567
lost, bleeding.

764
01:20:51,602 --> 01:20:55,173
I trusted you to be my teacher,
and you fed me lies.

765
01:20:55,208 --> 01:20:59,007
I tried to protect you.
- From the truth?  - From yourself.

766
01:20:59,042 --> 01:21:03,531
I have a new teacher now.
- Dormammu deceives you.

767
01:21:04,245 --> 01:21:06,492
You have no idea of what he truly is.

768
01:21:06,527 --> 01:21:11,520
His eternal life is not paradise,
but torment.  - Liar.

769
01:22:07,947 --> 01:22:11,720
Christine!!!
- Are you kidding me?

770
01:22:12,843 --> 01:22:14,543
Oh my god.

771
01:22:16,156 --> 01:22:17,892
No fibrillation. ...

772
01:22:18,421 --> 01:22:20,121
It's neurogenic?
- Yes.

773
01:22:28,718 --> 01:22:30,418
Nick?

774
01:22:32,409 --> 01:22:34,297
We need to relieve the
pressure on her brain.

775
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:41,200
She still drops.  - We're losing her!
- You need to increase her oxygen!

776
01:22:41,201 --> 01:22:44,262
I need a crash cart!
- Her pupils are dilated!

777
01:22:44,372 --> 01:22:47,997
No reflexes.
I'm not reading any brain activity.

778
01:22:58,746 --> 01:23:00,446
What are you doing?

779
01:23:01,002 --> 01:23:02,702
You're dying!

780
01:23:11,556 --> 01:23:14,252
You have to return to your body now.
You don't have time.

781
01:23:14,287 --> 01:23:18,241
Time is relative. Your body
hasn't even hit the floor yet.

782
01:23:20,247 --> 01:23:23,481
I've spent so many years
peering through time,

783
01:23:23,984 --> 01:23:25,967
looking at this exact moment.

784
01:23:26,317 --> 01:23:28,267
But I can't see past it.

785
01:23:28,478 --> 01:23:31,847
I've prevented countless terrible futures.

786
01:23:31,882 --> 01:23:34,423
And after each one, there's always another.

787
01:23:34,969 --> 01:23:36,933
And they all lead here,

788
01:23:37,604 --> 01:23:40,376
but never further.
- You think this is where you die.

789
01:23:41,491 --> 01:23:44,875
Do you wonder what I see
in your future?  - No.

790
01:23:47,129 --> 01:23:51,874
Yes.  - I never saw your future.
Only its possibilities.

791
01:23:52,767 --> 01:23:55,849
You have such a capacity for goodness.

792
01:23:55,884 --> 01:23:57,807
You always excelled,

793
01:23:57,842 --> 01:24:00,000
but not because you crave success,

794
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,294
but because of your fear of failure.

795
01:24:02,793 --> 01:24:04,756
It's what made me a great doctor.

796
01:24:04,791 --> 01:24:07,613
It's precisely what kept you from greatness.

797
01:24:08,499 --> 01:24:10,787
Arrogance and fear still keep you

798
01:24:10,822 --> 01:24:13,887
from learning the simplest and
most significant lesson of all.

799
01:24:14,330 --> 01:24:16,030
Which is?

800
01:24:17,412 --> 01:24:19,112
It's not about you.

801
01:24:23,378 --> 01:24:25,103
When you first came to me,

802
01:24:25,138 --> 01:24:28,024
you asked me how I was able
to heal Jonathan Pangborn.

803
01:24:28,988 --> 01:24:30,688
I didn't.

804
01:24:32,190 --> 01:24:35,752
He channels dimensional energy
directly into his own body.

805
01:24:36,945 --> 01:24:39,494
He uses magic to walk.
- Constantly.

806
01:24:40,178 --> 01:24:41,878
He had a choice,

807
01:24:42,843 --> 01:24:44,613
to return to to his own life

808
01:24:45,469 --> 01:24:47,471
or to serve something greater than himself.

809
01:24:47,506 --> 01:24:50,003
So, I could have my hands back again?

810
01:24:50,512 --> 01:24:52,212
My old life?

811
01:24:52,656 --> 01:24:54,356
You could.

812
01:24:55,014 --> 01:24:57,779
And the world would be all the lesser for it.

813
01:24:59,268 --> 01:25:02,110
I've hated drawing power from the Dark Dimension.

814
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:06,043
But as you well know, sometimes one
must break the rules

815
01:25:06,078 --> 01:25:09,885
in order to serve the greater good.
- Mordo won't see it that way.

816
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:13,046
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable,

817
01:25:13,081 --> 01:25:15,205
forged by the fires of his youth.

818
01:25:15,979 --> 01:25:19,109
He needs your flexibility,
just as you need his strength.

819
01:25:20,506 --> 01:25:24,214
Only together do you stand a
chance of stopping Dormammu.

820
01:25:24,610 --> 01:25:26,310
I'm not ready.

821
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,780
No one ever is.

822
01:25:30,999 --> 01:25:33,728
We don't get to choose our time.

823
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:39,224
Death is what gives life meaning.

824
01:25:40,945 --> 01:25:42,965
To know your days are numbered,

825
01:25:43,596 --> 01:25:45,296
your time is short.

826
01:25:47,408 --> 01:25:50,256
You'd think after all this time I'd be ready.

827
01:25:50,555 --> 01:25:52,338
But look at me,

828
01:25:52,339 --> 01:25:55,063
stretching one moment out into a thousand,

829
01:25:55,815 --> 01:25:57,795
just so I can watch the snow.

830
01:26:36,784 --> 01:26:38,484
Are you okay?

831
01:26:46,057 --> 01:26:48,595
I don't understand what's happening.
- I know.

832
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,820
But I have to go right now.

833
01:26:57,932 --> 01:27:00,421
You said that losing my hands didn't have to be the end,

834
01:27:00,456 --> 01:27:03,238
that it could be a beginning.
- Yeah.

835
01:27:05,249 --> 01:27:07,742
Because there are other ways to save lives.

836
01:27:11,247 --> 01:27:12,947
A harder way.

837
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,900
A weirder way.

838
01:27:17,057 --> 01:27:20,555
Dr. Palmer, the ER, please.
Dr. Palmer, the ER.

839
01:27:25,225 --> 01:27:26,925
I don't want to let you go.

840
01:28:15,143 --> 01:28:16,843
Stop.

841
01:28:21,356 --> 01:28:24,620
<font color="#fdff44"><b>Hong Kong</b></font>

842
01:28:46,042 --> 01:28:47,742
Choose your weapon wisely.

843
01:28:51,312 --> 01:28:53,038
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

844
01:28:55,782 --> 01:28:57,482
No one.

845
01:29:12,796 --> 01:29:16,461
Kaecilius.  - You're on the
wrong side of history, Wong.

846
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:32,572
She's dead.
- You were right.

847
01:29:33,423 --> 01:29:35,844
She wasn't who I thought she was.

848
01:29:36,373 --> 01:29:38,073
She was complicated.

849
01:29:43,036 --> 01:29:44,736
Complicated?

850
01:29:47,578 --> 01:29:49,394
The Dark Dimension is volatile.

851
01:29:50,002 --> 01:29:51,702
Dangerous.

852
01:29:52,097 --> 01:29:53,797
What if it overtook her?

853
01:29:55,313 --> 01:29:57,354
She taught us it was forbidden,

854
01:29:58,455 --> 01:30:02,238
while she drew on its power
to steal centuries of life.

855
01:30:02,273 --> 01:30:04,415
She did what she thought was right.

856
01:30:04,428 --> 01:30:06,128
The bill comes due.

857
01:30:07,189 --> 01:30:08,889
Don't you see?

858
01:30:10,662 --> 01:30:13,147
Her transgressions led the zealots to Dormammu.

859
01:30:13,182 --> 01:30:17,153
Kaecilius was her fault.

860
01:30:17,667 --> 01:30:20,800
And here we are, in the
consequence of her deception.

861
01:30:24,545 --> 01:30:27,977
A world on fire.
- Mordo, London Sanctum has fallen.

862
01:30:28,012 --> 01:30:31,890
And New York has been attacked. Twice.
You know where they're going next.

863
01:30:32,485 --> 01:30:36,113
Hong Kong.  - You told me once to
fight as if my life depended on it,

864
01:30:36,119 --> 01:30:38,918
because one day, it might.
Well, today is that day.

865
01:30:39,521 --> 01:30:41,617
I can not defeat them alone.

866
01:30:59,552 --> 01:31:01,252
The Sanctum has already fallen.

867
01:31:09,158 --> 01:31:10,858
The Dark Dimension.

868
01:31:12,387 --> 01:31:14,087
Dormammu is coming.

869
01:31:16,226 --> 01:31:17,973
It's too late.

870
01:31:17,974 --> 01:31:19,674
Nothing can stop him.

871
01:31:21,613 --> 01:31:23,313
Not necessarily.

872
01:31:27,083 --> 01:31:28,783
No.

873
01:32:09,803 --> 01:32:11,503
The spell works.

874
01:32:12,617 --> 01:32:14,372
We got a second chance.

875
01:33:53,257 --> 01:33:55,572
No!

876
01:34:05,135 --> 01:34:06,966
Wong!

877
01:34:15,101 --> 01:34:16,801
I'm breaking the laws of nature, I know.

878
01:34:19,282 --> 01:34:20,982
Well, don't stop now.

879
01:34:22,341 --> 01:34:25,631
When the Sanctum is restored, they will
attack again. We have to defend it.

880
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:28,050
Come on!

881
01:34:55,694 --> 01:34:58,858
Get up, Strange. Get up and fight!

882
01:34:58,908 --> 01:35:00,608
We will finish this.

883
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:03,400
You can't fight the inevitable.

884
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:08,570
Isn't it beautiful?

885
01:35:10,073 --> 01:35:12,128
A world beyond time.

886
01:35:15,098 --> 01:35:16,798
Beyond death.

887
01:35:20,609 --> 01:35:22,309
Beyond time...

888
01:35:22,566 --> 01:35:24,266
Strange!

889
01:35:55,976 --> 01:35:57,676
He's gone.

890
01:35:58,610 --> 01:36:01,533
Stephen Strange has left
to surrender to his power.

891
01:36:33,826 --> 01:36:36,647
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

892
01:36:36,682 --> 01:36:39,500
You've come to die.

893
01:36:39,535 --> 01:36:46,535
Your world is now my world, like all worlds.

894
01:37:16,676 --> 01:37:19,641
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

895
01:37:20,303 --> 01:37:22,693
You've come to die.

896
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:26,668
Your world is now my world...

897
01:37:27,505 --> 01:37:29,205
What is this?

898
01:37:29,327 --> 01:37:33,593
Illusion?  - No, this is real.
- Good.

899
01:37:44,055 --> 01:37:46,871
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

900
01:37:47,341 --> 01:37:50,185
You... what is happening?

901
01:37:50,901 --> 01:37:53,548
Just as you gave Kaecilius
powers from your dimension,

902
01:37:53,875 --> 01:37:55,996
I've brought a little power from mine.

903
01:37:56,655 --> 01:37:58,760
This is time.

904
01:37:59,326 --> 01:38:02,623
An endless loop of time.

905
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:05,687
You dare!

906
01:38:08,961 --> 01:38:10,729
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

907
01:38:11,995 --> 01:38:14,264
You cannot do this forever.

908
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,356
Actually, I can.

909
01:38:16,478 --> 01:38:18,178
This is how things are now.

910
01:38:18,868 --> 01:38:23,031
You and me, trapped in the moment, endlessly.

911
01:38:23,404 --> 01:38:26,620
Then you will spend eternity dying.

912
01:38:27,289 --> 01:38:30,853
Yeah. But everyone on Earth will live.

913
01:38:31,165 --> 01:38:32,865
But you will suffer.

914
01:38:33,054 --> 01:38:34,819
Pain is an old friend.

915
01:38:37,644 --> 01:38:39,344
Dormammu!

916
01:38:39,457 --> 01:38:42,080
I've come to bargain.
- End this!

917
01:38:42,223 --> 01:38:45,207
Dormammu! ... Dormammu! ...
Dormammu! ...

918
01:39:00,645 --> 01:39:03,300
You will never win.

919
01:39:04,861 --> 01:39:06,561
No...

920
01:39:06,785 --> 01:39:08,485
But I can lose.

921
01:39:08,986 --> 01:39:15,924
Again, and again, and again,
and again, forever.

922
01:39:17,596 --> 01:39:20,479
And that makes you my prisoner.
- No.

923
01:39:20,514 --> 01:39:24,956
Stop! Make this stop!!!

924
01:39:25,505 --> 01:39:28,944
Set me free!
- No.

925
01:39:29,834 --> 01:39:31,596
I've come to bargain.

926
01:39:33,359 --> 01:39:36,156
Oh, what do you want?

927
01:39:37,394 --> 01:39:39,551
Take your zealots from the Earth.

928
01:39:40,112 --> 01:39:42,126
End your assault on my world.

929
01:39:42,662 --> 01:39:44,537
Never come back.

930
01:39:44,955 --> 01:39:48,034
Do it, and I'll break the loop.

931
01:39:57,745 --> 01:39:59,445
Get up, Strange.

932
01:39:59,463 --> 01:40:01,168
Get up and fight!

933
01:40:01,544 --> 01:40:03,293
We will finish this.

934
01:40:03,792 --> 01:40:05,492
Isn't it beautiful?

935
01:40:07,012 --> 01:40:09,059
A world beyond time.

936
01:40:11,823 --> 01:40:13,523
Beyond death.

937
01:40:25,484 --> 01:40:27,982
What have you done?
- I made a bargain.

938
01:40:31,728 --> 01:40:35,901
What is this?  - Well, it's, uh...
it's everything you ever wanted.

939
01:40:37,227 --> 01:40:39,571
Eternal life as part of the One.

940
01:40:42,273 --> 01:40:44,233
You're not going to like it.

941
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:06,213
I think he really should have
stolen the whole book,

942
01:41:06,214 --> 01:41:07,914
because the warnings...

943
01:41:08,327 --> 01:41:10,994
the warnings come after the spells.

944
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:22,437
Oh, that's funny.

945
01:41:48,927 --> 01:41:50,627
We did it.

946
01:41:53,069 --> 01:41:54,769
Yes.

947
01:41:54,989 --> 01:41:56,689
Yes, we did it.

948
01:41:57,710 --> 01:42:01,097
By also violating the natural laws.

949
01:42:01,909 --> 01:42:03,862
Look around you. It's over.

950
01:42:04,464 --> 01:42:07,301
You still think there will be
no consequences, Strange?

951
01:42:08,683 --> 01:42:10,440
No price to pay?

952
01:42:11,023 --> 01:42:14,045
We broke our rules, just like her.

953
01:42:14,957 --> 01:42:18,740
The bill comes due.

954
01:42:19,505 --> 01:42:21,205
Always.

955
01:42:21,434 --> 01:42:24,757
A reckoning.

956
01:42:25,882 --> 01:42:28,712
I will follow this path no longer.

957
01:43:02,628 --> 01:43:04,328
Yeah, it's okay.

958
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:15,060
Wise choice.

959
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:19,365
You'll wear the eye of Agamotto
once you've mastered its powers.

960
01:43:19,925 --> 01:43:21,625
Until then,

961
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,237
best not to walk the streets wearing an infinity stone.

962
01:43:25,516 --> 01:43:29,393
A what?  - You have a gift for the mystic arts,
but you still have much to learn.

963
01:43:29,704 --> 01:43:31,487
ali me ?? ima ?? mnogo da ?? today.

964
01:43:32,627 --> 01:43:36,109
Word of the Ancient One's death
will spread through the multiverse.

965
01:43:36,531 --> 01:43:39,440
The Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme to defend it.

966
01:43:39,751 --> 01:43:41,921
We must be ready.
- We'll be ready.
