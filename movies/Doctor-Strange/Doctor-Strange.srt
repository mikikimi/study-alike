1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:03,600
Engsub

2
00:02:25,582 --> 00:02:27,282
Master Kaecilius.

3
00:02:28,888 --> 00:02:32,015
That ritual will bring you only sorrow.

4
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:09,508
Hypocrite!

5
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,590
Challenge round, Billy.

6
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,399
Oh, come on, Billy.
You gotta be messing with me.

7
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,100
No, doctor.

8
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:17,709
Feels So Good, Chuck Mangione, 1977.

9
00:05:18,106 --> 00:05:21,726
Seriously, Billy, you said this one
would be hard.  - Hah! It's 1978.

10
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:24,610
No, Billy, while Feels So Good
may have charted in 1978,

11
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:28,099
the album was released in December, 1977.

12
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,829
No, no. Wikipedia says the...
- Check again.

13
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:33,479
When did you...?  - Where do you store
all this useless information?

14
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:37,147
Useless? The man charted a
top ten hit with a Flugelhorn.

15
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:40,776
- Status, Billy? - 1977.
- All clean.

16
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:41,599
I hate you.

17
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,500
Woah! "Feels so good", doesn't it?

18
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:51,189
Oh, I... I've got this, Stephen. You've
done your bit. Go ahead, we'll close up.

19
00:05:52,504 --> 00:05:54,205
- What is that?
- GSW. <font color="#fdff44"><i>(Gunshot wound)</i></font>

20
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,431
It's amazing you kept him alive.

21
00:05:58,432 --> 00:06:00,432
Apneic, further brain stem
testing after reflex test...

22
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,517
I think I found the problem, Dr. Palmer.

23
00:06:02,887 --> 00:06:05,987
You left a bullet in his head.
- Thanks. It's impinging on the medulla.

24
00:06:05,988 --> 00:06:11,200
I needed a specialist to diagnose brain death.
Something about that doesn't feel right to me.

25
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:12,100
We have to run.

26
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:17,610
Dr. West! What are you doing? Hey!
- Organ harvesting. He's a donor.

27
00:06:17,673 --> 00:06:21,599
Slow down. I did not agree to that.  - I don't
need you to. We've already called brain death.

28
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,055
Too premature. We need to get him
prepped for a suboccipital craniotomy.

29
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:26,700
I'm not going to let you operate
on a dead man.  - What do you see?

30
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:32,749
A bullet?  - A perfect bullet. It's been hardened.
You harden a bullet by alloying lead with antimony.

31
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,499
A toxic metal. And as it leaks directly
into the cerebral spinal fluid...

32
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:39,100
Rapid-onset central nervous system
shutdown.  - We need to go.

33
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:41,300
The patient's not dead, but he's dying.
Do you still want to harvest his organs?

34
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,600
I'll assist you.
- No!

35
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,479
Dr. Palmer will assist me.

36
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:04,191
Thank you.

37
00:07:10,444 --> 00:07:13,563
Image status, STAT.
- We do not have time for that.

38
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:17,199
You can't do it by hand.
- I can and I will.

39
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:19,513
This isn't the time
for showing off, Strange.

40
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:22,413
How about ten minutes ago, when
you called the wrong time of death?

41
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,930
Cranial nerves intact.

42
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:00,205
Dr. West, cover your watch.

43
00:08:43,695 --> 00:08:46,299
You know, you didn't have to
humiliate him in front of everyone.

44
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,100
I didn't have to save his patient either. But,
you know, sometimes I just can't help myself.

45
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:53,600
Nick is a great doctor.
- You came to me.

46
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:56,400
Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.
- You had a second opinion.

47
00:08:56,401 --> 00:09:00,600
What you needed was a competent one.  - Well, all the
more reason why you should be my neurosurgeon on call.

48
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:02,000
You could make such a difference.

49
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:03,925
I can't work in your butcher shop.
- Hey! Look, he...

50
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:07,800
Look, I'm using transsectioned spinal cords to
stimulate neurogenesis in the central nervous system.

51
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:10,010
My work is at least going to
save thousands for years to come.

52
00:09:10,011 --> 00:09:13,000
In the ER, I get to save one drunk idiot with a gun.

53
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:15,278
Yeah, you're right. In the ER,
you're only saving lives.

54
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:18,060
There's no fame,
there's no CNN interviews...

55
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:20,586
Well, I guess I'll have to stick with Nick.

56
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:23,430
Oh, wait a minute. You're not...
you guys aren't...

57
00:09:23,435 --> 00:09:28,000
What?  - Sleeping together. Sorry,
I thought that was implicit in my disgust.

58
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:28,849
Explicit, actually.

59
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,800
And no, I have a very strict rule
against dating colleagues.

60
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:33,700
Oh really?
- I call it the Strange policy.

61
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:36,600
Oh, good! I'm glad something is named after me.

62
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:38,600
You know, I invented a laminectomy procedure,

63
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:41,899
and yet, somehow, no one seems to want
to call it the Strange technique.

64
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,900
We invented that technique.  - You know,
I gotta say, I'm very flattered by your policy.

65
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:51,976
Look, I'm talking tonight at a
Neurological Society dinner. Come with me.

66
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:56,000
Another speaking engagement? So romantic.

67
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:57,500
You used to love going to those things with me.

68
00:09:57,501 --> 00:09:59,600
We had fun together.
- No. You've had fun.

69
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:04,000
They weren't about us, they were about you.

70
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:07,300
- Not only about me.
- Stephen. Everything is about you.

71
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:12,399
Maybe we can hyphenate. Strange-Palmer technique.

72
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,200
Palmer-Strange.

73
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,100
Billy! What have you got for me?

74
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:08,050
I've got a 35-year-old Air Force colonel.
Crushed his lower spine

75
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:11,098
in some kind of experimental armor.
Mid-thoracic vertebral fracture.

76
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:13,899
Well, I could help, but
so can 50 other people.

77
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,700
Find me something worth my time.

78
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:19,599
I have a 68-year-old female
with an advanced brain stem glioma.

79
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah, you want me to screw up
my perfect record? Definitely not.

80
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:25,949
How about a 22-year-old
female with an electronic

81
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:28,984
implant in her brain to control
schizophrenia struck by lightning?

82
00:11:29,264 --> 00:11:30,964
That does sound interesting.

83
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,198
Could you send me the... got it.

84
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:39,143
Hey.

85
00:12:40,338 --> 00:12:42,200
It's okay. It's going to be okay.

86
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:58,410
What did they do?

87
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:04,900
They rushed you in a chopper.
But it took a little while to find you.

88
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:08,599
Golden hours for nerve damage went by
while you were in the car.

89
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,600
What did they do?!?

90
00:13:13,956 --> 00:13:17,100
11 stainless steel pins in the bones.

91
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:19,804
Multiple torn ligaments.

92
00:13:20,783 --> 00:13:23,268
Severe nerve damage in both hands.

93
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:26,500
You were on the table for 11 hours.

94
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,710
Look at these fixators.

95
00:13:30,618 --> 00:13:32,800
No one could have done better.

96
00:13:38,248 --> 00:13:39,948
I could have done better.

97
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:12,600
No. No.
- Give your body time to heal.

98
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:16,300
You ruined me.

99
00:14:17,196 --> 00:14:18,949
How long until I'm...

100
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,099
Dr. Strange... those tissues
are still healing.

101
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,620
So speed it up. Pass the stent under the
brachial artery under the radial artery.

102
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,325
It's possible.

103
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:31,900
Experimental and expensive, but possible.

104
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:33,674
All I need is possible.

105
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,296
Up.

106
00:14:59,641 --> 00:15:01,414
Up.

107
00:15:01,415 --> 00:15:03,115
Show me your strength.

108
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,300
Ah! It's useless. - It's not
useless, man, you can do this.

109
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:16,579
Then answer me this, bachelor's degree.

110
00:15:17,321 --> 00:15:21,300
Have you ever known anyone
with nerve damage this severe

111
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:23,000
to do this, and actually recover?

112
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:29,186
One guy, yeah. Factory accident, broke
his back. Paralyzed. His leg wasted away.

113
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:31,970
He had pain in his shoulder from the wheelchair.

114
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:34,300
He came in 3 times a week.

115
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:37,290
But one day he stopped coming.
I thought he was dead.

116
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,098
A few years later, he
walked past me on the street.

117
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:44,400
He walked? - Yeah, he walked.
- Bullshit. Show me his file.

118
00:15:44,492 --> 00:15:47,280
It can take me a while to pull
the files from the archive.

119
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:50,230
But if it proves your arrogant ass wrong,

120
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,950
it's worth it.

121
00:16:05,735 --> 00:16:08,200
I looked at all your research.

122
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:12,440
I read all the papers you've sent,
but... none will work.

123
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:16,299
I... I don't think you realize
how severe the damage is, I...

124
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,400
Look, here's the thing, I ...
- At best, I'd try and fail.

125
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:21,090
Look, I understand.
Here's the thing. I...

126
00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:24,220
What you want from me is impossible,
Stephen.  - Come on...

127
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:26,756
I've got my own reputation to consider.
- Etienne, wait.

128
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:30,100
I can't help you. ...
- No. No, no, wait!

129
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:37,143
Hi.

130
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:44,623
He won't do it.

131
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:48,515
He's a hack.

132
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:53,335
There's a new procedure in Tokyo.
They culture donor stem cells

133
00:16:53,336 --> 00:16:57,400
and then harvest them and 3D-print a scaffold.
If I could get a loan together, just...

134
00:16:57,401 --> 00:16:59,250
Stephen...
- A small loan, 200,000.

135
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,903
Stephen. You've always spent money
as fast as you could make it

136
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,098
but now you're spending money
you don't even have.

137
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,600
Maybe it's time to consider stopping.

138
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,500
No. Now is exactly the time not to stop.

139
00:17:10,501 --> 00:17:12,999
Because, you see,
I'm not getting any better!

140
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,308
But this isn't medicine anymore.
This is mania.

141
00:17:16,728 --> 00:17:19,350
Some things just can't be fixed.

142
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,379
Life without my work...
- Is still life.

143
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,600
This isn't the end. There are other things
that can give your life meaning.

144
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:28,300
Like what? Like you?

145
00:17:30,357 --> 00:17:32,700
And this is the part where you apologize.

146
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:34,900
This is the part where you leave.

147
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,099
Fine. I can't watch you
do this to yourself anymore.

148
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,990
Too difficult for you, is it?
- Yes.

149
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It is. And it breaks my heart to see
you this way.  - No. Don't pity me.

150
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:48,603
I'm not pitying you.  - Oh yeah?
Then what are you doing here?

151
00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:51,098
Bringing cheese and wine as if we're
old friends going for a picnic?

152
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:53,109
We are not friends, Christine.
We were barely lovers.

153
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,100
You just love a sob story, don't you?
Is that what I am to you now?

154
00:17:57,101 --> 00:17:59,740
Poor Stephen Strange, charity case.

155
00:17:59,741 --> 00:18:02,360
He finally needs me. Another dreg
of humanity for you to work on.

156
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:06,110
Fix him up and send him back into
the world, heart is just humming...

157
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:09,400
You care so much! Don't you?!?

158
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,667
Goodbye, Stephen.

162
00:19:14,746 --> 00:19:16,446
You talk a lot!

00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,350
Who are you?  - Paralyzed
from the mid-chest down.

165
00:19:25,354 --> 00:19:27,090
Partial paralysis of both hands.

166
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:28,100
I don't know you.

167
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:32,400
I'm Stephen Strange. I'm a
neurosurgeon. Was a neurosurgeon.

168
00:19:33,015 --> 00:19:36,000
Actually, you know what, man?
I think I know you.

169
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,072
I came to your office once.
You refused to see me.

170
00:19:39,107 --> 00:19:40,888
I never got past your assistant.

171
00:19:42,157 --> 00:19:46,011
You were untreatable.
- No glory for you in that, right?

172
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:51,099
You came back from a place
there is no way back from!

173
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,250
I... I'm trying to find my own way back.

174
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,300
Hey, Pangborn, you in it or not?

175
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,520
Alright.

176
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,900
I'd given up on my body.

177
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:19,900
I thought my mind was the only thing I had left.
I should at least try to elevate that.

178
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,400
So I sat with gurus, and sacred women.

179
00:20:23,482 --> 00:20:26,631
Strangers carried me to mountain tops
to see holy men.

180
00:20:26,783 --> 00:20:29,650
And finally, I found my teacher.

181
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:34,900
And my mind was elevated.
And my spirit deepened.

182
00:20:35,554 --> 00:20:38,512
And somehow...
- Your body healed.  - Yes.

183
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,849
And there were deeper secrets to learn then,

184
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,810
but I did not have the strength
to receive them.

185
00:20:44,821 --> 00:20:47,820
I chose to settle for my miracle,
and I came back home.

186
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,690
The place you're looking for
is called Kamar-Taj.

187
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,350
But the cost is high.
- How much?

188
00:20:59,072 --> 00:21:00,800
I'm not talking about money.

189
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:04,520
Good luck.

190
00:21:05,573 --> 00:21:07,273
Give me the ball!

191
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,400
<font color="#fdff44"><b></b></font>

192
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,699
Excuse me. Kamar-Taj?

193
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:33,400
Do you know where Kamar-Taj is?

194
00:21:46,062 --> 00:21:48,474
<font color="#fdff44"><i>Sign: "Himalayan Healing!
Find Peace! Find Yourself!"</i></font>

195
00:21:57,092 --> 00:21:58,792
Kamar-Taj?

196
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,560
Kamar-Taj...

197
00:22:29,977 --> 00:22:31,677
Okay.

198
00:22:33,793 --> 00:22:37,852
Guys, I... I don't have
any money.  - Your watch.

199
00:22:37,903 --> 00:22:42,999
No, please. It's all I
have left.  - Your watch.

200
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:47,237
Alright.

201
00:23:27,246 --> 00:23:29,307
You're looking for Kamar-Taj?

202
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:03,100
Really? Are you sure
you got the right place?

203
00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:07,305
That one looks a little more...
Kamar-y Taj-y.

204
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,099
I once stood in your place.

205
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:16,600
And I, too, was... disrespectful.

206
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,099
So might I offer you some advice?

207
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,600
Forget everything you think you know.

208
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:28,099
Uh... alright.

209
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,300
The sanctuary of our teacher.
The Ancient One.

210
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:43,667
The Ancient One?
What's his real name?

211
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,600
Right. Forget everything I
think I know. I'm sorry.

212
00:24:59,527 --> 00:25:01,227
Thank you for... huh!

213
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,096
Okay, that's, uh... a thing...

214
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:07,989
Thank you.

215
00:25:08,022 --> 00:25:09,815
Hello.

216
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,400
Uh, thank you.
And thank you.

217
00:25:13,897 --> 00:25:18,350
Uh, thank you, Ancient One...
for... seeing me...

218
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,800
You're very welcome.

219
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,403
The Ancient One.  - Thank you,
Master Mordo. Thank you, Master Hamir!

220
00:25:27,414 --> 00:25:29,114
Mr. Strange!

221
00:25:29,197 --> 00:25:33,740
Doctor, actually.  - Well, no.
Not anymore, surely.

222
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:38,300
Isn't that why you're here?
You've undergone many procedures.

223
00:25:38,301 --> 00:25:39,800
Seven, right?
- Yeah...

224
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:43,532
Good tea.

225
00:25:48,121 --> 00:25:51,930
Did you heal a man named
Pangborn? A paralyzed man.

226
00:25:51,965 --> 00:25:55,300
In a way.  - You helped
him to walk again.

227
00:25:56,043 --> 00:26:00,900
Yes.  - How do you correct a
complete C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

228
00:26:00,901 --> 00:26:03,300
Oh, I didn't correct it.

229
00:26:03,301 --> 00:26:05,600
He couldn't walk;
I convinced him that he could.

230
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:07,768
You're not suggesting
it was psychosomatic?

231
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:12,000
When you reattach a severed nerve, is it you
who heals it back together or the body?

232
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:17,700
It's the cells. - And the cells are only programmed
to put themselves together in very specific ways.

233
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:21,098
That's right. - What if I told you
that your own body could be convinced

234
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:24,800
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

235
00:26:24,993 --> 00:26:28,099
You're talking about
cellular regeneration.

236
00:26:28,394 --> 00:26:31,121
That's... bleeding-edge medical tech.

237
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:34,390
Is that why you're working here,
without a governing medical board?

238
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:36,691
I mean... just how experimental
is your treatment?

239
00:26:37,954 --> 00:26:39,654
Quite.

240
00:26:39,828 --> 00:26:45,000
So, you figured out a way to
reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

241
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:46,437
No, Mr. Strange.

242
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:52,099
I know how to reorient the spirit
to better heal the body.

243
00:26:54,056 --> 00:26:57,300
Spirit... to heal the body.

244
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:03,300
Huh. A... al... al... alright.
How do we do that? Where do we start?

245
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,100
Don't like that map?

246
00:27:10,101 --> 00:27:17,000
Oh, no. It's... it's very good. It's just...
you know, I've seen it before. In gift shops.

247
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:22,099
And what about this one?
- Acupuncture, great.  - Yeah?

248
00:27:22,802 --> 00:27:24,700
What about... that one?

249
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:27,585
You're showing me an MRI scan?
I can not believe this.

250
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,540
Each of those maps was drawn up by someone
who could see in part, but not the whole.

251
00:27:32,546 --> 00:27:35,430
I spent my last dollar getting here

252
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:38,830
on a one-way ticket, and you're talking
to me about healing through belief?

253
00:27:38,838 --> 00:27:41,600
You're a man who's looking
at the world through a keyhole,

254
00:27:41,601 --> 00:27:44,423
and you spent your whole life
trying to widen that keyhole.

255
00:27:44,425 --> 00:27:49,280
To see more, know more. And now,
on hearing that it can be widened

256
00:27:49,282 --> 00:27:52,900
in ways you can't imagine,
you reject the possibility?

257
00:27:52,901 --> 00:27:58,950
No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales
about chakras, or energy, or the power of belief.

258
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:01,560
There is no such thing as spirit!

259
00:28:01,572 --> 00:28:04,900
We are made of matter, and nothing more.

260
00:28:04,911 --> 00:28:09,540
We're just another tiny, momentary speck
within an indifferent universe.

261
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:13,250
You think too little of yourself.
- Oh, you think you see through me, do you?

262
00:28:13,251 --> 00:28:17,620
Well, you don't. But I see through you!!!

263
00:28:35,096 --> 00:28:39,058
What did you just do to me?!?  - I pushed
your astral form out of your physical form.

264
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:42,320
What's in that tea? Psilocybin? LSD?

265
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,126
Just tea.

266
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,950
With a little honey.

267
00:28:45,951 --> 00:28:50,050
What just happened?  - For a moment,
you entered the astral dimension.

268
00:28:50,052 --> 00:28:53,800
What??  - A place where the soul
exists apart from the body.

269
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:59,099
Why are you doing this to me?
- To show you just how much you don't know.

270
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,350
Open your eye.

271
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,800
No! No... No! Shit!

272
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:12,943
Oh god! Oh god! Oh god!

273
00:29:13,931 --> 00:29:15,944
This isn't real it isn't real it isn't

274
00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:28,737
<b><i>His pulse is reaching dangerous levels.</i></b>

275
00:29:34,121 --> 00:29:35,821
He looks alright to me.

276
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,900
You think you know how the world works?

277
00:29:40,901 --> 00:29:44,600
You think that this material
universe is all there is?

278
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,600
What is real?

279
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:55,900
What mysteries lie beyond
the reach of your senses?

280
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:02,583
At the root of existence,
mind and matter meet.

281
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,600
Thoughts create reality.

282
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,000
This universe is only one
of an infinite number.

283
00:30:25,331 --> 00:30:27,300
Worlds without end.

284
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:31,099
Some benevolent and life-giving;

285
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:37,099
others filled with malice and hunger.

286
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:46,300
Dark places, where powers
older than time lie...

287
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:49,809
ravenous... and waiting.

288
00:30:56,743 --> 00:31:02,999
Who are you in this vast multiverse,
Mr. Strange?

289
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:26,300
Have you seen that before in a gift shop?

290
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:34,801
Teach me!

291
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,620
No.

292
00:31:43,524 --> 00:31:45,224
No... No!

293
00:31:45,775 --> 00:31:47,750
No, no, no, no no no no!

294
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:53,900
No! Open the door! Please!

295
00:31:56,906 --> 00:31:58,606
Thank you, Masters.

296
00:32:03,115 --> 00:32:05,900
You think I'm wrong to cast him out?

297
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:08,600
5 hours later, he's still on your doorstep.

298
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:11,382
There's a strength to him.

299
00:32:11,383 --> 00:32:16,310
Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition...
I've seen it all before.

300
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,900
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

301
00:32:18,901 --> 00:32:21,740
I can not lead another
gifted student to power,

302
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:23,850
only to lose him to the darkness.

303
00:32:25,641 --> 00:32:30,238
You didn't lose me. I wanted
the power to defeat my enemies.

304
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,000
You gave me the power
to defeat my demons.

305
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:37,300
And to live within the natural law.

306
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:39,600
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

307
00:32:40,403 --> 00:32:42,400
We only learn to live above them.

308
00:32:44,902 --> 00:32:48,000
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

309
00:32:48,081 --> 00:32:51,500
If he deciphers them,
he could bring ruin upon us all.

310
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:54,650
There may be dark days ahead.

311
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,250
Perhaps Kamar-Taj could
use a man like Strange.

312
00:33:08,189 --> 00:33:10,000
Don't shut me out.

313
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:16,000
I've nowhere else to go.

314
00:33:20,106 --> 00:33:21,806
Thank you.

315
00:33:26,282 --> 00:33:27,982
Bed.

316
00:33:28,648 --> 00:33:30,348
Rest.

317
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,320
Meditate...

318
00:33:32,383 --> 00:33:34,083
if you can.

319
00:33:34,374 --> 00:33:36,380
The Ancient One will send for you.

320
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,400
Uh, what's this? My mantra?

321
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:49,900
The Wi-Fi password.

322
00:33:50,884 --> 00:33:52,600
We're not savages.

323
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:16,629
<font color="#fdff44"><i>Time will tell how much I love you.</i>

324
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,620
<i>Christine</i></font>

325
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:28,450
The language of the mystic arts
is as old as civilization.

326
00:34:29,518 --> 00:34:34,099
The sorcerers of antiquity called
the use of this language "spells".

327
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,600
But if that word offends
your modern sensibilities,

328
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:39,014
you can call it "program".

329
00:34:39,438 --> 00:34:42,350
The source code that shapes reality.

330
00:34:43,045 --> 00:34:45,650
We harness energy

331
00:34:46,741 --> 00:34:49,800
drawn from other dimensions
of the multiverse,

332
00:34:51,285 --> 00:34:53,050
to cast spells,

333
00:34:54,632 --> 00:34:57,099
conjure shields

334
00:34:57,518 --> 00:34:59,300
and weapons

335
00:35:00,397 --> 00:35:02,450
to make magic.

336
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,099
But... even if my fingers could do that,

337
00:35:20,447 --> 00:35:23,700
My hands would just be
waving in the air. I mean,

338
00:35:23,718 --> 00:35:25,800
how do I get from here to there?

339
00:35:25,801 --> 00:35:28,310
How did you get to
reattach severed nerves,

340
00:35:28,311 --> 00:35:32,280
and put a human spine
back together bone by bone?

341
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:34,600
Study and practice. Years of it.

342
00:35:43,187 --> 00:35:44,887
Hey.

343
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:50,950
Mr. Strange.
- Uh... Stephen, please.

344
00:35:51,311 --> 00:35:54,011
- And you are?
- Wong. - Wong.

345
00:35:55,087 --> 00:35:57,999
Just Wong? Like... Adele?

346
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:01,950
Or... Aristotle.

347
00:36:03,366 --> 00:36:05,800
Drake. Bono.

348
00:36:08,582 --> 00:36:10,400
Eminem.

349
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:15,400
The book of the invisible sun.

350
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,990
Astronomia Nova.

351
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,092
Codex Imperium.

352
00:36:20,396 --> 00:36:22,150
Key of Solomon.

353
00:36:24,021 --> 00:36:26,490
You finished all of this?
- Yup.

354
00:36:27,535 --> 00:36:29,880
Come with me.
- Alright.

355
00:36:30,924 --> 00:36:33,011
This section is for Masters only.

356
00:36:33,013 --> 00:36:35,390
But at my discretion,
others may use it.

357
00:36:36,543 --> 00:36:38,390
We should start with Maxim's Primer.

358
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,950
How is your Sanskrit?

359
00:36:44,732 --> 00:36:46,990
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

360
00:36:47,779 --> 00:36:50,300
Read it. Classical Sanskrit.

361
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,400
What are those?

362
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:58,800
The Ancient One's private collection.

363
00:36:59,381 --> 00:37:01,081
So they're forbidden?

364
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:04,720
No knowledge in Kamar-Taj is forbidden.
Only certain practices.

365
00:37:07,145 --> 00:37:11,280
Those books are far too advanced for
anyone other than the Sorcerer Supreme.

366
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:24,150
This one's got pages missing.

367
00:37:24,656 --> 00:37:28,180
That's the book of Cagliostro.
The study of time.

368
00:37:28,605 --> 00:37:31,220
One of the rituals was
stolen by a former Master.

369
00:37:32,644 --> 00:37:34,900
A zealot called Kaecilius.

370
00:37:36,466 --> 00:37:39,095
Just after he strung up
the former librarian,

371
00:37:39,096 --> 00:37:41,560
and relieved him of his head.

372
00:37:44,411 --> 00:37:46,500
I'm now the guardian of these books.

373
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:51,700
So if a volume from this collection
should be stolen again, I'd know it.

374
00:37:51,704 --> 00:37:55,050
And you'd be dead before
you ever left the compound.

375
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,599
What if it's just overdue? You know?

376
00:38:00,981 --> 00:38:04,199
Any... late fees I should know about?
Maybe, perhaps, uhm...

377
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:10,101
Uh, you know, people used
to think that I was funny.

378
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,600
Did they work for you?

379
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:17,790
Alright. Well, it's been lovely talking to you,
thank you for the books and for the horrifying story

380
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:20,611
and for the threat upon my life.

381
00:38:50,972 --> 00:38:54,520
Now we receive the power to destroy
the one who betrayed us.

382
00:38:57,117 --> 00:38:59,150
The one who betrays the world.

383
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:02,180
Mastery of the sling ring is
essential to the mystic arts.

384
00:40:02,623 --> 00:40:05,450
They allow us to travel
throughout the multiverse.

385
00:40:05,922 --> 00:40:08,099
All you need to do is focus.

386
00:40:08,342 --> 00:40:10,099
Visualize.

387
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:12,650
See the destination in your mind.

388
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:16,320
Look beyond the world in front of you.

389
00:40:17,275 --> 00:40:19,560
Imagine every detail.

390
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:25,099
The clearer the picture,
the quicker, and easier,

391
00:40:25,112 --> 00:40:27,220
the gateway will come.

392
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:32,050
And stop.

393
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,290
I'd like a moment alone
with Mr. Strange.

394
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,990
Of course.

395
00:40:40,243 --> 00:40:43,299
My hands.  - It's not
about your hands.

396
00:40:43,255 --> 00:40:45,099
How is this not about my hands?

397
00:40:45,107 --> 00:40:46,850
Master Hamir.

398
00:41:00,643 --> 00:41:02,399
Thank you, Master Hamir.

399
00:41:03,383 --> 00:41:05,600
You cannot beat a river into submission.

400
00:41:06,587 --> 00:41:11,010
You have to surrender to its current,
and use its power as your own.

401
00:41:11,314 --> 00:41:14,452
I... I control it by surrendering control?
That doesn't make any sense.

402
00:41:14,453 --> 00:41:17,660
Not everything does.
Not everything has to.

403
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,790
Your intellect has
taken you far in life.

404
00:41:20,799 --> 00:41:22,529
But it will take you no further.

405
00:41:22,618 --> 00:41:24,360
Surrender, Stephen.

406
00:41:24,904 --> 00:41:26,620
Silence your ego

407
00:41:27,224 --> 00:41:28,960
and your power will rise.

408
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,555
Follow me.

409
00:41:36,472 --> 00:41:38,825
Wait. Is this...
- Everest.

410
00:41:40,971 --> 00:41:47,360
It's beautiful.  - Yeah, you're right.
Beautiful. It's freezing, but... beautiful.

411
00:41:47,431 --> 00:41:51,600
At this temperature,
a person can last for 13 minutes

412
00:41:51,601 --> 00:41:55,100
before suffering permanent
loss of function.  - Great.

413
00:41:55,101 --> 00:42:00,100
But you will likely go into shock
within the first 2 minutes.  - What?

414
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:03,099
Surrender, Stephen.
- No, no!!! Don't!

415
00:42:12,149 --> 00:42:15,250
How is our new recruit?
- We shall see.

416
00:42:15,757 --> 00:42:17,500
Any second now.

417
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,480
No, not again.

418
00:42:26,307 --> 00:42:28,150
Maybe I should...

419
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,860
Stephen.
- Wong.

420
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:46,980
What do you want, Strange?
- Books on astral projection.

421
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:50,470
You're not ready for that.
- Try me, Beyoncé.

422
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,460
Come on. You've heard of her.
She's a huge star, right?

423
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,250
Do you ever laugh?

424
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,770
Oh come on, just
give me the book, huh?

425
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:06,085
No.

426
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,650
Once, in this room,
you begged me to let you learn.

427
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:42,000
Now I'm told you question every lesson,
prefering to teach yourself.

428
00:44:42,001 --> 00:44:44,900
Once, in this room,
you told me to open my eyes.

429
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:47,690
Now I'm being told to blindly
accept rules that make no sense.

430
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:51,099
Like the rule against conjuring
a gateway in the library?

431
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,600
Wong told on me?  - You're advancing
quickly with your sorcery skills.

432
00:44:55,099 --> 00:44:57,810
You need a safe space
to practice your spells.

433
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,320
You are now inside the Mirror Dimension.

434
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:20,700
ever present but undetected.

435
00:45:21,861 --> 00:45:24,203
The real world isn't affected
by what happens here.

436
00:45:25,003 --> 00:45:28,471
We use the Mirror Dimension
to train, surveil,

437
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,641
and sometimes to contain threats.

438
00:45:31,851 --> 00:45:34,553
You don't want to be stuck
in here without your sling ring.

439
00:45:34,588 --> 00:45:37,552
Hold on. Sorry, what
do you mean, threats?

440
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:49,185
Learning of an infinite multiverse

441
00:45:49,186 --> 00:45:51,487
included learning of infinite dangers.

442
00:45:51,522 --> 00:45:55,937
And if I told you everything else that you don't
already know, you'd run from here in terror.

443
00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:04,331
So, just how ancient is she?

444
00:46:06,782 --> 00:46:08,888
No one knows the age of the Sorcerer Supreme.

445
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:12,952
Only that she is Celtic
and never talks about her past.

446
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,715
You follow her even though you don't know?

447
00:46:14,916 --> 00:46:16,634
I know that she's steadfast,
but unpredictable.

448
00:46:17,634 --> 00:46:19,230
Merciless, yet kind.

449
00:46:20,662 --> 00:46:22,362
She made me what I am.

450
00:46:24,387 --> 00:46:27,600
Trust your teacher.
And don't lose your way.

451
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:30,259
Like Kaecilius?
- That's right.

452
00:46:35,474 --> 00:46:37,174
You knew him.

453
00:46:37,716 --> 00:46:41,117
When he first came to us,
he'd lost everyone he ever loved.

454
00:46:41,152 --> 00:46:42,865
He was a grieving and broken man,

455
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:45,161
searching for answers in the mystic arts.

456
00:46:45,196 --> 00:46:48,656
A brilliant student, but
he was proud, headstrong.

457
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:51,341
Questioned the Ancient One,
rejected our teaching.

458
00:46:58,576 --> 00:47:00,276
He left Kamar-Taj.

459
00:47:00,491 --> 00:47:03,116
His disciples followed him like sheep

460
00:47:03,117 --> 00:47:05,361
seduced by false doctrine.

461
00:47:05,396 --> 00:47:08,459
He stole the forbidden ritual, right?
- Yeah.

462
00:47:09,098 --> 00:47:10,798
What did it do?

463
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,290
No more questions.

464
00:47:15,202 --> 00:47:17,621
What's that?
- That's a question.

465
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,994
This is a relic.

466
00:47:21,264 --> 00:47:24,590
Some magic is too powerful to sustain,
so we imbue objects with it.

467
00:47:25,813 --> 00:47:28,103
allowing them to take the strain we can not.

468
00:47:28,274 --> 00:47:32,850
This is the Staff of the Living Tribunal.

469
00:47:36,446 --> 00:47:38,146
There are many relics.

470
00:47:38,162 --> 00:47:39,862
The Wand of Watoomb.

471
00:47:39,914 --> 00:47:41,641
The Bolting Boots of Voltor.

472
00:47:41,642 --> 00:47:45,777
They just roll of the tongue, don't they?
When do I get my relic?

473
00:47:45,778 --> 00:47:48,290
When you're ready.
- I think I'm ready.

474
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:50,909
You're ready when the relic
decides you're ready.

475
00:47:51,696 --> 00:47:53,396
For now,

476
00:47:54,391 --> 00:47:56,091
conjure a weapon.

477
00:47:56,729 --> 00:47:58,617
Yeah.

478
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:08,452
Fight! Fight like
your life depended on it!

479
00:48:14,288 --> 00:48:16,791
Because one day, it may.

480
00:48:37,163 --> 00:48:40,247
<font color="#fdff44"><i>Christine</i></font>

481
00:48:44,324 --> 00:48:48,900
<font color="#fdff44"><i>I'm emailing you one more time to</i></font>

482
00:49:27,541 --> 00:49:29,241
Wong?

483
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:42,711
Okay.

484
00:49:42,712 --> 00:49:45,729
First, open the Eye of Agamotto.

485
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,869
Alright.

486
00:50:31,283 --> 00:50:32,983
Oh my.

487
00:51:09,884 --> 00:51:11,584
Dormammu.

488
00:51:13,053 --> 00:51:14,753
The Dark Dimension.

489
00:51:15,388 --> 00:51:17,088
Eternal life?

490
00:51:23,088 --> 00:51:24,788
Stop!!!

491
00:51:27,845 --> 00:51:30,089
Tampering with the continuum
of probability is forbidden!

492
00:51:30,124 --> 00:51:32,435
I... I wa... I was just doing
exactly what it said in the book!

493
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:35,769
And what did the book say about
the dangers of performing that ritual?

494
00:51:35,804 --> 00:51:37,671
Yeah, I don't know. I hadn't
gotten to that part yet.

495
00:51:37,688 --> 00:51:40,272
Temporal manipulations can
create branches in time.

496
00:51:40,918 --> 00:51:42,717
Unstable dimensional openings.

497
00:51:42,752 --> 00:51:45,594
Spacious paradoxes! Time loops!!!

498
00:51:45,643 --> 00:51:48,912
You want to get stuck reliving the
same moment over, and over, forever,

499
00:51:48,947 --> 00:51:50,647
or never having existed at all?

500
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,708
They really should put the
warnings before that stuff.

501
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,685
Your curiosity could have gotten you killed.

502
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,275
You weren't manipulating
the space-time continuum,

503
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:00,405
you were wrecking it.

504
00:52:00,735 --> 00:52:04,181
We do not tamper with
natural law. We defend it.

505
00:52:04,194 --> 00:52:05,894
How did you learn to do that?

506
00:52:07,114 --> 00:52:10,022
Where did you learn the litany of spells
required to even understand it?

507
00:52:10,057 --> 00:52:13,600
I've got a photographic memory. It's how I
got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time.

508
00:52:13,601 --> 00:52:17,600
What you just did
takes more than a good memory.

509
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:19,099
You were born for the mystic arts.

510
00:52:19,316 --> 00:52:22,649
And yet, my hands still shake.
- For now, yes.

511
00:52:22,684 --> 00:52:25,216
Not forever?
- We're not prophets.

512
00:52:25,251 --> 00:52:27,430
When do you start telling me what we are?

513
00:52:32,835 --> 00:52:36,753
While heroes like the Avengers
protect the world from physical dangers,

514
00:52:37,162 --> 00:52:40,063
we sorcerers safeguard it
against more mystical threats.

515
00:52:41,481 --> 00:52:45,256
The Ancient One is the latest
in a long line of Sorcerers Supreme

516
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:48,863
Going back thousands of years
to the father of the mystic arts,

517
00:52:48,898 --> 00:52:50,598
the mighty Agamotto.

518
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:55,453
The same sorcerer who created the eye
you so recklessly borrowed.

519
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,817
Agamotto built 3 Sanctums in places of power,

520
00:52:59,852 --> 00:53:02,405
where great cities now stand.

521
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,496
That door leads to the Hong Kong Sanctum,

522
00:53:05,855 --> 00:53:07,555
that door to the New York Sanctum.

523
00:53:08,358 --> 00:53:10,058
That one, to the London Sanctum.

524
00:53:10,409 --> 00:53:14,807
Together, the Sanctums generate a
protective shield around our world.

525
00:53:15,732 --> 00:53:19,196
The Sanctums protect the
world, and we sorcerers

526
00:53:19,603 --> 00:53:22,610
protect the Sanctums.
- From what?

527
00:53:22,645 --> 00:53:25,708
Other-dimensional beings
that threaten our universe.

528
00:53:26,551 --> 00:53:28,251
Like Dormammu?

529
00:53:29,036 --> 00:53:30,736
Where did you learn that name?

530
00:53:31,681 --> 00:53:34,254
I just read it in the book
of Cagliostro. Why?

531
00:53:39,755 --> 00:53:41,455
Dormammu dwells in the Dark Dimension.

532
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:44,859
Beyond time.

533
00:53:45,232 --> 00:53:49,302
He is the cosmic conquerer,
the destroyer of worlds.

534
00:53:49,729 --> 00:53:52,508
A being of infinite power
and endless hunger,

535
00:53:53,569 --> 00:53:55,580
on a quest to invade every universe

536
00:53:55,615 --> 00:53:58,475
and bring all worlds into
his Dark Dimension.

537
00:53:59,588 --> 00:54:01,912
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

538
00:54:03,459 --> 00:54:05,240
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

539
00:54:05,886 --> 00:54:09,503
A ritual to contact Dormammu and
draw power from the Dark Dimension.

540
00:54:13,807 --> 00:54:15,507
Uuuh... okay. Okay.

541
00:54:17,385 --> 00:54:21,513
I... time-out. I... I came
here to heal my hands,

542
00:54:22,256 --> 00:54:25,938
not to fight in some mystical war.

543
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:29,999
London.

544
00:54:33,287 --> 00:54:34,994
Kaecilius!

545
00:54:34,995 --> 00:54:36,695
No!!!

546
00:54:42,189 --> 00:54:43,889
Wong? Mordo?

547
00:55:20,648 --> 00:55:22,348
<font color="#fdff44"><i>177A Bleecker Street</i></font>

548
00:55:34,936 --> 00:55:36,636
Hello?

549
00:56:05,501 --> 00:56:07,201
Hello?

550
00:56:45,244 --> 00:56:48,605
Daniel. I see they made you
Master of the Sanctum.

551
00:56:49,912 --> 00:56:51,612
Do you know what that means?

552
00:56:52,448 --> 00:56:54,148
That you'll die protecting it.

553
00:57:10,373 --> 00:57:12,073
Stop!

554
00:57:22,755 --> 00:57:25,004
How long have you been
at Kamar-TaJ, Mister...?

555
00:57:25,288 --> 00:57:26,988
Doctor.

556
00:57:27,841 --> 00:57:31,043
Just Doctor?  - It's Strange.

557
00:57:32,455 --> 00:57:35,347
Maybe. Who am I to judge?

558
00:59:59,975 --> 01:00:01,962
You don't know how to use that, do you?

559
01:01:47,064 --> 01:01:48,764
What?

560
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:54,600
You'll die here.
- Oh, stop it.

561
01:01:55,001 --> 01:01:56,154
I said, stop it!

562
01:01:56,189 --> 01:01:59,637
You cannot stop this, Mr. Doctor.  - Why...
look, I don't even know what "this" is.

563
01:02:00,273 --> 01:02:03,331
It's the end and the beginning.

564
01:02:03,389 --> 01:02:05,985
The many becoming the few,
becoming the One.

565
01:02:07,778 --> 01:02:11,100
Look, if you're not going to start making sense,
I'm just going to have to put this thing back on.

566
01:02:11,101 --> 01:02:12,275
Tell me, Mr. Doctor.

567
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:15,495
Alright, look. My name
is Dr. Stephen Strange.

568
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:18,708
You are a doctor?
- Yes.  - A scientist.

569
01:02:19,367 --> 01:02:24,222
You understand the laws of nature.
All things age. All things die.

570
01:02:24,445 --> 01:02:27,960
In the end, our sun burns out,
our universe grows cold and perishes.

571
01:02:28,841 --> 01:02:30,637
But the Dark Dimension...

572
01:02:31,033 --> 01:02:32,745
it's a place beyond time.

573
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:36,206
That's it. I'm putting this thing back on.
This world doesn't have to die, Doctor.

574
01:02:36,241 --> 01:02:39,174
This world can take its rightful
place among so many others,

575
01:02:39,209 --> 01:02:40,909
as part of the One.

576
01:02:41,156 --> 01:02:42,856
The great and beautiful One.

577
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:45,539
And we can all live forever.

578
01:02:45,853 --> 01:02:47,553
Really?

579
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:52,608
What do you have to gain out of
this New Age dimensional utopia?

580
01:02:53,441 --> 01:02:57,032
The same as you. The same as
everyone. Life. Eternal life.

581
01:02:58,132 --> 01:03:00,143
People think in terms of good and evil,

582
01:03:00,178 --> 01:03:03,551
but really, time is the true enemy
of us all. Time kills everything.

583
01:03:03,552 --> 01:03:05,450
What about the people you killed?

584
01:03:05,485 --> 01:03:09,584
Tiny, momentary specks within
an indifferent universe.

585
01:03:11,548 --> 01:03:13,248
Yes. You see,

586
01:03:14,242 --> 01:03:16,075
you see what we're doing?

587
01:03:17,018 --> 01:03:20,781
The world is not what it ought to be.
Humanity longs for the eternal,

588
01:03:21,238 --> 01:03:23,675
for a world beyond time, because
time is what enslaves us.

589
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:25,848
Time is an insult.

590
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,332
Death is an insult.

591
01:03:29,378 --> 01:03:31,078
Doctor...

592
01:03:31,649 --> 01:03:33,836
We don't seek to rule this world.

593
01:03:33,871 --> 01:03:36,759
We seek to save it, to
hand it over to Dormammu,

594
01:03:36,794 --> 01:03:39,344
who is the intent of all evolution,

595
01:03:40,106 --> 01:03:41,806
the Why of all existence.

596
01:03:42,871 --> 01:03:45,588
The Sorcerer Supreme defends existence.

597
01:03:47,225 --> 01:03:51,261
What was it that brought you to Kamar-Taj,
Doctor? Was it enlightenment?

598
01:03:51,971 --> 01:03:53,671
Power?

599
01:03:54,944 --> 01:03:57,283
You came to be healed, as did we all.

600
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,953
Kamar-Taj is a place that
collects broken things.

601
01:04:01,958 --> 01:04:03,786
We all come with the
promise of being healed,

602
01:04:03,821 --> 01:04:06,566
but instead, the Ancient One
gives us parlor tricks.

603
01:04:08,107 --> 01:04:10,250
The real magic she keeps for herself.

604
01:04:10,285 --> 01:04:13,656
Have you ever wondered how she
managed to live this long?

605
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:21,271
I... I saw the rituals in
the book of Cagliostro.

606
01:04:21,306 --> 01:04:23,932
So, you know.

607
01:04:23,967 --> 01:04:29,076
The ritual gives me the power to overthrow
the Ancient One and tear her Sanctums down,

608
01:04:29,111 --> 01:04:31,591
to let the Dark Dimension in.

609
01:04:32,147 --> 01:04:35,502
Because what the Ancient One
hoards, Dormammu gives freely.

610
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,406
Life, everlasting.

611
01:04:39,048 --> 01:04:42,372
He is not the destroyer of worlds,
Doctor, he is the savior of worlds.

612
01:04:44,266 --> 01:04:47,100
No. I mean, come on.
Look at your face.

613
01:04:47,799 --> 01:04:49,984
Dormammu made you a murderer.

614
01:04:50,201 --> 01:04:52,654
Just how good can his kingdom be?

615
01:04:54,503 --> 01:04:56,203
You think that's funny?

616
01:04:56,478 --> 01:04:58,178
No. No, Doctor.

617
01:04:58,307 --> 01:05:00,865
What's funny is that you've
lost your sling ring.

618
01:06:08,995 --> 01:06:11,491
Sir, can I help you?
- Dr. Palmer, where is she?

619
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:14,483
Sir, we need to...  - Where is she?
- At the nurses station.

620
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,355
Christine!

621
01:06:17,952 --> 01:06:22,867
Stephen? Oh my god. What...  - We need to
get me on an operation table now. Just you.

622
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,740
Now! I don't have any time!

623
01:06:25,092 --> 01:06:28,596
What happened?
- Stabbed. Cardiac tamponade.

624
01:06:29,975 --> 01:06:31,675
What are you wearing?

625
01:06:37,889 --> 01:06:42,637
The chest cavity is clear.
- The blood... is in the pericardial sac.

626
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:47,014
No. No no no no no no no!
Stephen! Stephen!

627
01:06:48,918 --> 01:06:50,618


628
01:07:15,594 --> 01:07:17,294
Just a little higher.

629
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,560
Please be careful with the needle.

630
01:07:22,392 --> 01:07:24,092
Stephen?

631
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:28,863
Oh lord, oh lord. What am I seeing?
- My astral body.

632
01:07:30,347 --> 01:07:33,203
Are you dead?
- No, Christine, but I am dying.

633
01:07:35,546 --> 01:07:37,676
Right. Right.

634
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:42,398
Yeah. Alright.

635
01:07:51,505 --> 01:07:53,225
I've... I've never seen
a wound like this before.

636
01:07:53,752 --> 01:07:55,452
What were you stabbed with?

637
01:07:55,893 --> 01:07:57,593
I don't know.

638
01:08:16,664 --> 01:08:19,366
I'm going to have to
vanish now.  - No, I...

639
01:08:19,908 --> 01:08:21,608
Keep me alive, will you?

640
01:08:24,682 --> 01:08:26,573
Okay! Okay.

641
01:08:51,235 --> 01:08:52,935
Bullshit!

642
01:09:23,224 --> 01:09:24,924
<font color="#fdff44"><i>Charging to 200 Joule</i></font>

643
01:09:35,986 --> 01:09:37,686
Stephen, come on.

644
01:09:40,155 --> 01:09:43,024
Hit me again!
- Stop doing that!

645
01:09:43,059 --> 01:09:44,904
Up the voltage and hit me again.

646
01:09:44,905 --> 01:09:47,250
No, your heart is beating!
- Just do it!

647
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:51,110


648
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:57,779


649
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:20,760
Oh god!

650
01:10:20,861 --> 01:10:22,631
Are you ok?
- Yeah.

651
01:10:24,091 --> 01:10:25,791
Okay.

652
01:10:31,063 --> 01:10:34,709
After all this time,
you just show up here,

653
01:10:36,593 --> 01:10:40,147
flying out of your body?
- Yeah, I know.

654
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:42,560
I missed you too, by the way.

655
01:10:44,256 --> 01:10:46,706
I wrote 2 emails, but
you never responded.

656
01:10:46,741 --> 01:10:48,441
Why would I?

657
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,323
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

658
01:10:52,596 --> 01:10:54,298
For all of it.
And you were right,

659
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:58,153
I was a complete asshole.
I treated you so horribly

660
01:10:58,188 --> 01:11:02,382
and you deserved so much more.
- Stop. You... you're clearly in shock.

661
01:11:04,171 --> 01:11:05,871
I mean, what the hell is happening?

662
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,500
Where have you been?

663
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:11,950
Well, after Western medicine failed me,

664
01:11:11,985 --> 01:11:14,900
I headed East, and I
wound up in Kathmandu.

665
01:11:14,935 --> 01:11:17,410
Kathmandu?
- Yeah.

666
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:22,503
What, like the Bob Seger song?
- 1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. And then,

667
01:11:22,538 --> 01:11:24,300
I went to a place called Kamar-Taj

668
01:11:24,301 --> 01:11:29,716
and I talked to someone
called the Ancient One, and...

669
01:11:30,998 --> 01:11:34,202
Oh. So you joined a cult.
- No, I didn't. Not exactly. I mean,

670
01:11:34,237 --> 01:11:37,311
they did teach me to tap into powers
that I never even knew existed.

671
01:11:37,346 --> 01:11:39,661
Yeah, that sounds like a cult.
- It's not a cult.

672
01:11:39,933 --> 01:11:42,969
Well, that's what a cultist
would say.  - Oh, no.

673
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,979
Wait, Stephen... what do
you think you're doing?

674
01:11:46,014 --> 01:11:47,714
I'm late for a cult meeting.

675
01:11:51,834 --> 01:11:53,634
This is insane.
- Yeah.

676
01:11:53,669 --> 01:11:55,675
Where are you going?

677
01:11:56,081 --> 01:11:57,784
Uhm...
- Just tell me the truth?

678
01:11:57,785 --> 01:12:01,923
Well, a powerful sorcerer, who gave
himself over to an ancient entity

679
01:12:01,931 --> 01:12:04,591
who can bend the very laws of physics,
tried very hard to kill me,

680
01:12:04,596 --> 01:12:06,558
but I left him chained up
in Greenwich Village,

681
01:12:06,563 --> 01:12:08,686
and the quickest way back there
is through a dimensional gateway

682
01:12:08,687 --> 01:12:12,811
that I opened up in the mop closet.
- Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.

683
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:25,278
I really do have to go.

684
01:12:25,945 --> 01:12:27,645


685
01:13:12,561 --> 01:13:14,261
Strange!

686
01:13:16,368 --> 01:13:20,049
You're okay.  - A relative term,
but yeah, I'm okay.

687
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,580
The Cloak of Levitation.

688
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,300
It came to you.

689
01:13:25,736 --> 01:13:27,436
No minor feat.

690
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:29,825
It's a fickle thing.

691
01:13:29,901 --> 01:13:32,056
He's escaped.
- Kaecilius?  - Yeah.

692
01:13:33,379 --> 01:13:35,857
He can fold space and matter at will.

693
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:41,218
He folds matter outside the mirror
dimension? In the real world?  - Yeah.

694
01:13:41,743 --> 01:13:43,553
How many more?
- Two.

695
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:49,245
I stranded one in the desert.
- And the other?  - His body was in the hall.

696
01:13:49,246 --> 01:13:53,043
Master Drumm was in the foyer.
- He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

697
01:13:53,044 --> 01:13:54,744
The London Sanctum has fallen.

698
01:13:55,373 --> 01:13:59,558
Only New York and Hong Kong remain now
to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

699
01:14:00,535 --> 01:14:02,786
You defended the New York Sanctum from attack.

700
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,334
With its Master gone, it needs another,

701
01:14:05,369 --> 01:14:07,349
Master Strange.

702
01:14:09,826 --> 01:14:11,526
No.

703
01:14:11,992 --> 01:14:13,899
It is Dr. Strange.

704
01:14:13,934 --> 01:14:16,239
Not Master Strange, not Mr. Strange,

705
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,179
Doctor Strange.

706
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:22,783
When I became a doctor,
I swore an oath to do no harm.

707
01:14:22,818 --> 01:14:25,885
And I have just killed a man!
I'm not doing that again.

708
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,568
I became a doctor to save
lives, not take them.

709
01:14:28,603 --> 01:14:32,732
You become a doctor to save
one life above all others.

710
01:14:32,788 --> 01:14:34,561
Your own.

711
01:14:34,596 --> 01:14:38,364
Still seeing through me, are you?
- I see what I've always seen.

712
01:14:38,399 --> 01:14:40,553
Your overinflated ego.

713
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:43,757
You want to go back to the delusion
that you can control anything,

714
01:14:44,337 --> 01:14:47,329
even death, which no one can control.

715
01:14:47,364 --> 01:14:50,052
Not even the great doctor
Stephen Strange.

716
01:14:50,468 --> 01:14:52,678
Not even Dormammu?

717
01:14:54,112 --> 01:14:55,812
He offers immortality.

718
01:14:56,077 --> 01:14:58,049
It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.

719
01:14:58,084 --> 01:15:01,426
He feeds off it.
- Like you feed on him?

720
01:15:01,427 --> 01:15:04,918
You talk to me about controlling death.
Well, I know how you do it.

721
01:15:04,953 --> 01:15:07,939
I've seen the missing rituals
from the book of Cagliostro.

722
01:15:08,988 --> 01:15:12,160
Measure your next words
very carefully, doctor.

723
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:14,051
Because you might not like them?

724
01:15:14,086 --> 01:15:16,799
Because you may not know
of what you speak.

725
01:15:16,834 --> 01:15:19,573
What is he talking about?
- I'm talking about her long life.

726
01:15:19,608 --> 01:15:21,583
The source of her immortality.

727
01:15:23,926 --> 01:15:26,740
She draws power from the
Dark Dimension to stay alive.

728
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:32,499
That's not true.  - I've seen
the rituals and worked them out.

729
01:15:33,415 --> 01:15:35,115
I know how you do it.

730
01:15:36,464 --> 01:15:39,355
Once they regroup,
the zealots will be back.

731
01:15:40,462 --> 01:15:42,162
You'll need reinforcements.

732
01:15:49,673 --> 01:15:53,402
She is not who you think she is.
- You don't have the right to say that.

733
01:15:53,437 --> 01:15:58,114
You have no idea of the responsibility that rests
upon her shoulders.  - No, and I don't want to know.

734
01:15:58,479 --> 01:15:59,100
You're a coward.  - Because I'm not a killer?

735
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:02,592
- These zealots will snuff us all out,

736
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:05,659
and you can muster the strength
to snuff them out first?

737
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:08,645
What do you think I just did?
- You saved your own life!

738
01:16:09,551 --> 01:16:13,703
And then whined about it like a wounded dog.
- When you would have done it so easily?

739
01:16:13,738 --> 01:16:16,718
You have no idea.
The things I've done...

740
01:16:18,402 --> 01:16:20,102
And the answer is yes.

741
01:16:20,633 --> 01:16:23,639
Without hesitation.
- Even if there's another way?

742
01:16:23,674 --> 01:16:27,100
There is no other way.
- You lack imagination.

743
01:16:27,101 --> 01:16:32,068
No, Stephen. You lack a spine.

744
01:16:37,147 --> 01:16:38,847
They're back.

745
01:16:45,159 --> 01:16:47,116
We have to end this. Right now!

746
01:16:52,967 --> 01:16:55,583
Strange! Get down here and fight!

747
01:16:56,517 --> 01:16:58,217


748
01:17:01,807 --> 01:17:03,507
The Mirror Dimension.

749
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:05,913
You can't affect the
real world in here.

750
01:17:06,489 --> 01:17:09,344
Who's laughing now, asshole?

751
01:17:11,553 --> 01:17:13,253
I am.

752
01:17:26,123 --> 01:17:28,613
They've got no sling ring. I mean,
they can't escape, right?

753
01:17:29,998 --> 01:17:31,698
Trei!

754
01:17:47,889 --> 01:17:51,557
Their connection to the Dark Dimension makes
them more powerful in the Mirror Dimension.

755
01:17:51,592 --> 01:17:54,551
They can't affect the real world,
but they can still kill us.

756
01:17:54,557 --> 01:17:56,863
This wasn't clever. This was suicide!

757
01:18:13,651 --> 01:18:15,351
That is hilarious.

758
01:19:01,989 --> 01:19:03,689
This was a mistake.

759
01:20:36,068 --> 01:20:37,768
It's true.

760
01:20:38,648 --> 01:20:41,109
She does draw power from the Dark Dimension.

761
01:20:45,104 --> 01:20:46,908
Kaecilius.

762
01:20:49,009 --> 01:20:52,082
I came to you, broken,

763
01:20:52,248 --> 01:20:54,467
lost, bleeding.

764
01:20:54,502 --> 01:20:58,073
I trusted you to be my teacher,
and you fed me lies.

765
01:20:58,108 --> 01:21:01,907
I tried to protect you.
- From the truth?  - From yourself.

766
01:21:01,942 --> 01:21:06,431
I have a new teacher now.
- Dormammu deceives you.

767
01:21:07,145 --> 01:21:09,392
You have no idea of what he truly is.

768
01:21:09,427 --> 01:21:14,420
His eternal life is not paradise,
but torment.  - Liar.

769
01:22:10,847 --> 01:22:14,620
Christine!!!
- Are you kidding me?

770
01:22:15,743 --> 01:22:17,443
Oh my god.

771
01:22:19,056 --> 01:22:20,792
No fibrillation. ...

772
01:22:21,321 --> 01:22:23,021
It's neurogenic?
- Yes.

773
01:22:31,618 --> 01:22:33,318
Nick?

774
01:22:35,309 --> 01:22:37,197
We need to relieve the
pressure on her brain.

775
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:44,100
She still drops.  - We're losing her!
- You need to increase her oxygen!

776
01:22:44,101 --> 01:22:47,162
I need a crash cart!
- Her pupils are dilated!

777
01:22:47,272 --> 01:22:50,897
No reflexes.
I'm not reading any brain activity.

778
01:23:01,646 --> 01:23:03,346
What are you doing?

779
01:23:03,902 --> 01:23:05,602
You're dying!

780
01:23:14,456 --> 01:23:17,152
You have to return to your body now.
You don't have time.

781
01:23:17,187 --> 01:23:21,141
Time is relative. Your body
hasn't even hit the floor yet.

782
01:23:23,147 --> 01:23:26,381
I've spent so many years
peering through time,

783
01:23:26,884 --> 01:23:28,867
looking at this exact moment.

784
01:23:29,217 --> 01:23:31,167
But I can't see past it.

785
01:23:31,378 --> 01:23:34,747
I've prevented countless terrible futures.

786
01:23:34,782 --> 01:23:37,323
And after each one, there's always another.

787
01:23:37,869 --> 01:23:39,833
And they all lead here,

788
01:23:40,504 --> 01:23:43,276
but never further.
- You think this is where you die.

789
01:23:44,391 --> 01:23:47,775
Do you wonder what I see
in your future?  - No.

790
01:23:50,029 --> 01:23:54,774
Yes.  - I never saw your future.
Only its possibilities.

791
01:23:55,667 --> 01:23:58,749
You have such a capacity for goodness.

792
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:00,707
You always excelled,

793
01:24:00,742 --> 01:24:02,900
but not because you crave success,

794
01:24:02,935 --> 01:24:05,194
but because of your fear of failure.

795
01:24:05,693 --> 01:24:07,656
It's what made me a great doctor.

796
01:24:07,691 --> 01:24:10,513
It's precisely what kept you from greatness.

797
01:24:11,399 --> 01:24:13,687
Arrogance and fear still keep you

798
01:24:13,722 --> 01:24:16,787
from learning the simplest and
most significant lesson of all.

799
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:18,930
Which is?

800
01:24:20,312 --> 01:24:22,012
It's not about you.

801
01:24:26,278 --> 01:24:28,003
When you first came to me,

802
01:24:28,038 --> 01:24:30,924
you asked me how I was able
to heal Jonathan Pangborn.

803
01:24:31,888 --> 01:24:33,588
I didn't.

804
01:24:35,090 --> 01:24:38,652
He channels dimensional energy
directly into his own body.

805
01:24:39,845 --> 01:24:42,394
He uses magic to walk.
- Constantly.

806
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:44,778
He had a choice,

807
01:24:45,743 --> 01:24:47,513
to return to to his own life

808
01:24:48,369 --> 01:24:50,371
or to serve something greater than himself.

809
01:24:50,406 --> 01:24:52,903
So, I could have my hands back again?

810
01:24:53,412 --> 01:24:55,112
My old life?

811
01:24:55,556 --> 01:24:57,256
You could.

812
01:24:57,914 --> 01:25:00,679
And the world would be all the lesser for it.

813
01:25:02,168 --> 01:25:05,010
I've hated drawing power from the Dark Dimension.

814
01:25:05,539 --> 01:25:08,943
But as you well know, sometimes one
must break the rules

815
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:12,785
in order to serve the greater good.
- Mordo won't see it that way.

816
01:25:13,296 --> 01:25:15,946
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable,

817
01:25:15,981 --> 01:25:18,105
forged by the fires of his youth.

818
01:25:18,879 --> 01:25:22,009
He needs your flexibility,
just as you need his strength.

819
01:25:23,406 --> 01:25:27,114
Only together do you stand a
chance of stopping Dormammu.

820
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:29,210
I'm not ready.

821
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:32,680
No one ever is.

822
01:25:33,899 --> 01:25:36,628
We don't get to choose our time.

823
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:42,124
Death is what gives life meaning.

824
01:25:43,845 --> 01:25:45,865
To know your days are numbered,

825
01:25:46,496 --> 01:25:48,196
your time is short.

826
01:25:50,308 --> 01:25:53,156
You'd think after all this time I'd be ready.

827
01:25:53,455 --> 01:25:55,238
But look at me,

828
01:25:55,239 --> 01:25:57,963
stretching one moment out into a thousand,

829
01:25:58,715 --> 01:26:00,695
just so I can watch the snow.

830
01:26:39,684 --> 01:26:41,384
Are you okay?

831
01:26:48,957 --> 01:26:51,495
I don't understand what's happening.
- I know.

832
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:55,720
But I have to go right now.

833
01:27:00,832 --> 01:27:03,321
You said that losing my hands didn't have to be the end,

834
01:27:03,356 --> 01:27:06,138
that it could be a beginning.
- Yeah.

835
01:27:08,149 --> 01:27:10,642
Because there are other ways to save lives.

836
01:27:14,147 --> 01:27:15,847
A harder way.

837
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:19,800
A weirder way.

838
01:27:19,957 --> 01:27:23,455
Dr. Palmer, the ER, please.
Dr. Palmer, the ER.

839
01:27:28,125 --> 01:27:29,825
I don't want to let you go.

840
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:19,743
Stop.

841
01:28:24,256 --> 01:28:27,520
<font color="#fdff44"><b>Hong Kong</b></font>

842
01:28:48,942 --> 01:28:50,642
Choose your weapon wisely.

843
01:28:54,212 --> 01:28:55,938
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

844
01:28:58,682 --> 01:29:00,382
No one.

845
01:29:15,696 --> 01:29:19,361
Kaecilius.  - You're on the
wrong side of history, Wong.

846
01:29:32,163 --> 01:29:35,472
She's dead.
- You were right.

847
01:29:36,323 --> 01:29:38,744
She wasn't who I thought she was.

848
01:29:39,273 --> 01:29:40,973
She was complicated.

849
01:29:45,936 --> 01:29:47,636
Complicated?

850
01:29:50,478 --> 01:29:52,294
The Dark Dimension is volatile.

851
01:29:52,902 --> 01:29:54,602
Dangerous.

852
01:29:54,997 --> 01:29:56,697
What if it overtook her?

853
01:29:58,213 --> 01:30:00,254
She taught us it was forbidden,

854
01:30:01,355 --> 01:30:05,138
while she drew on its power
to steal centuries of life.

855
01:30:05,173 --> 01:30:07,315
She did what she thought was right.

856
01:30:07,328 --> 01:30:09,028
The bill comes due.

857
01:30:10,089 --> 01:30:11,789
Don't you see?

858
01:30:13,562 --> 01:30:16,047
Her transgressions led the zealots to Dormammu.

859
01:30:16,082 --> 01:30:20,053
Kaecilius was her fault.

860
01:30:20,567 --> 01:30:23,700
And here we are, in the
consequence of her deception.

861
01:30:27,445 --> 01:30:30,877
A world on fire.
- Mordo, London Sanctum has fallen.

862
01:30:30,912 --> 01:30:34,790
And New York has been attacked. Twice.
You know where they're going next.

863
01:30:35,385 --> 01:30:39,013
Hong Kong.  - You told me once to
fight as if my life depended on it,

864
01:30:39,019 --> 01:30:41,818
because one day, it might.
Well, today is that day.

865
01:30:42,421 --> 01:30:44,517
I can not defeat them alone.

866
01:31:02,452 --> 01:31:04,152
The Sanctum has already fallen.

867
01:31:12,058 --> 01:31:13,758
The Dark Dimension.

868
01:31:15,287 --> 01:31:16,987
Dormammu is coming.

869
01:31:19,126 --> 01:31:20,873
It's too late.

870
01:31:20,874 --> 01:31:22,574
Nothing can stop him.

871
01:31:24,513 --> 01:31:26,213
Not necessarily.

872
01:31:29,983 --> 01:31:31,683
No.

873
01:32:12,703 --> 01:32:14,403
The spell works.

874
01:32:15,517 --> 01:32:17,272
We got a second chance.

875
01:33:56,157 --> 01:33:58,472
No!

876
01:34:08,035 --> 01:34:09,866
Wong!

877
01:34:18,001 --> 01:34:19,701
I'm breaking the laws of nature, I know.

878
01:34:22,182 --> 01:34:23,882
Well, don't stop now.

879
01:34:25,241 --> 01:34:28,531
When the Sanctum is restored, they will
attack again. We have to defend it.

880
01:34:28,566 --> 01:34:30,950
Come on!

881
01:34:58,594 --> 01:35:01,758
Get up, Strange. Get up and fight!

882
01:35:01,808 --> 01:35:03,508
We will finish this.

883
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,300
You can't fight the inevitable.

884
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:11,470
Isn't it beautiful?

885
01:35:12,973 --> 01:35:15,028
A world beyond time.

886
01:35:17,998 --> 01:35:19,698
Beyond death.

887
01:35:23,509 --> 01:35:25,209
Beyond time...

888
01:35:25,466 --> 01:35:27,166
Strange!

889
01:35:58,876 --> 01:36:00,576
He's gone.

890
01:36:01,510 --> 01:36:04,433
Stephen Strange has left
to surrender to his power.

891
01:36:36,726 --> 01:36:39,547
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

892
01:36:39,582 --> 01:36:42,400
You've come to die.

893
01:36:42,435 --> 01:36:49,435
Your world is now my world, like all worlds.

894
01:37:19,576 --> 01:37:22,541
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

895
01:37:23,203 --> 01:37:25,593
You've come to die.

896
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:29,568
Your world is now my world...

897
01:37:30,405 --> 01:37:32,105
What is this?

898
01:37:32,227 --> 01:37:36,493
Illusion?  - No, this is real.
- Good.

899
01:37:46,955 --> 01:37:49,771
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

900
01:37:50,241 --> 01:37:53,085
You... what is happening?

901
01:37:53,801 --> 01:37:56,448
Just as you gave Kaecilius
powers from your dimension,

902
01:37:56,775 --> 01:37:58,896
I've brought a little power from mine.

903
01:37:59,555 --> 01:38:01,660
This is time.

904
01:38:02,226 --> 01:38:05,523
An endless loop of time.

905
01:38:06,036 --> 01:38:08,587
You dare!

906
01:38:11,861 --> 01:38:13,629
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

907
01:38:14,895 --> 01:38:17,164
You cannot do this forever.

908
01:38:17,556 --> 01:38:19,256
Actually, I can.

909
01:38:19,378 --> 01:38:21,078
This is how things are now.

910
01:38:21,768 --> 01:38:25,931
You and me, trapped in the moment, endlessly.

911
01:38:26,304 --> 01:38:29,520
Then you will spend eternity dying.

912
01:38:30,189 --> 01:38:33,753
Yeah. But everyone on Earth will live.

913
01:38:34,065 --> 01:38:35,765
But you will suffer.

914
01:38:35,954 --> 01:38:37,719
Pain is an old friend.

915
01:38:40,544 --> 01:38:42,244
Dormammu!

916
01:38:42,357 --> 01:38:44,980
I've come to bargain.
- End this!

917
01:38:45,123 --> 01:38:48,107
Dormammu! ... Dormammu! ...
Dormammu! ...

918
01:39:03,545 --> 01:39:06,200
You will never win.

919
01:39:07,761 --> 01:39:09,461
No...

920
01:39:09,685 --> 01:39:11,385
But I can lose.

921
01:39:11,886 --> 01:39:18,824
Again, and again, and again,
and again, forever.

922
01:39:20,496 --> 01:39:23,379
And that makes you my prisoner.
- No.

923
01:39:23,414 --> 01:39:27,856
Stop! Make this stop!!!

924
01:39:28,405 --> 01:39:31,844
Set me free!
- No.

925
01:39:32,734 --> 01:39:34,496
I've come to bargain.

926
01:39:36,259 --> 01:39:39,056
Oh, what do you want?

927
01:39:40,294 --> 01:39:42,451
Take your zealots from the Earth.

928
01:39:43,012 --> 01:39:45,026
End your assault on my world.

929
01:39:45,562 --> 01:39:47,437
Never come back.

930
01:39:47,855 --> 01:39:50,934
Do it, and I'll break the loop.

931
01:40:00,645 --> 01:40:02,345
Get up, Strange.

932
01:40:02,363 --> 01:40:04,068
Get up and fight!

933
01:40:04,444 --> 01:40:06,193
We will finish this.

934
01:40:06,692 --> 01:40:08,392
Isn't it beautiful?

935
01:40:09,912 --> 01:40:11,959
A world beyond time.

936
01:40:14,723 --> 01:40:16,423
Beyond death.

937
01:40:28,384 --> 01:40:30,882
What have you done?
- I made a bargain.

938
01:40:34,628 --> 01:40:38,801
What is this?  - Well, it's, uh...
it's everything you ever wanted.

939
01:40:40,127 --> 01:40:42,471
Eternal life as part of the One.

940
01:40:45,173 --> 01:40:47,133
You're not going to like it.

941
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:09,113
I think he really should have
stolen the whole book,

942
01:41:09,114 --> 01:41:10,814
because the warnings...

943
01:41:11,227 --> 01:41:13,894
the warnings come after the spells.

944
01:41:23,150 --> 01:41:25,337
Oh, that's funny.

945
01:41:51,827 --> 01:41:53,527
We did it.

946
01:41:55,969 --> 01:41:57,669
Yes.

947
01:41:57,889 --> 01:41:59,589
Yes, we did it.

948
01:42:00,610 --> 01:42:03,997
By also violating the natural laws.

949
01:42:04,809 --> 01:42:06,762
Look around you. It's over.

950
01:42:07,364 --> 01:42:10,201
You still think there will be
no consequences, Strange?

951
01:42:11,583 --> 01:42:13,340
No price to pay?

952
01:42:13,923 --> 01:42:16,945
We broke our rules, just like her.

953
01:42:17,857 --> 01:42:21,640
The bill comes due.

954
01:42:22,405 --> 01:42:24,105
Always.

955
01:42:24,334 --> 01:42:27,657
A reckoning.

956
01:42:28,782 --> 01:42:31,612
I will follow this path no longer.

957
01:43:05,528 --> 01:43:07,228
Yeah, it's okay.

958
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:17,960
Wise choice.

959
01:43:18,339 --> 01:43:22,265
You'll wear the eye of Agamotto
once you've mastered its powers.

960
01:43:22,825 --> 01:43:24,525
Until then,

961
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:28,137
best not to walk the streets wearing an infinity stone.

962
01:43:28,416 --> 01:43:32,293
A what?  - You have a gift for the mystic arts,
but you still have much to learn.

963
01:43:32,604 --> 01:43:34,387
ali me ?? ima ?? mnogo da ?? today.

964
01:43:35,527 --> 01:43:39,009
Word of the Ancient One's death
will spread through the multiverse.

965
01:43:39,431 --> 01:43:42,340
The Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme to defend it.

966
01:43:42,651 --> 01:43:44,821
We must be ready.
- We'll be ready.
