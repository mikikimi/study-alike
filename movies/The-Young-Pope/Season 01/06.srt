1
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:37,600
Edgar!

2
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,200
What did he die of?

3
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:49,125
The same thing our Church
is going to die of.

4
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,050
Old age.

5
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,200


6
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,225
...et apostolicae fidei cultoribus.

7
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,025
What is it about that statuette
that you find so sensual?

8
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,950
I'd prefer not to delve
into my psyche.

9
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,200
Holy Father,
donations have declined.

10
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,175
Revenues from religious taxes,

11
00:01:58,225 --> 00:02:03,075
which our bishops and dioceses
depend on for their survival,

12
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:08,375
have declined, tourist visits
to the Vatican have declined,

13
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:12,200
greatly reducing the influx
of funds to Vatican City.

14
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,250
There is not much
that the Vatican Bank can do.

15
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,175
Our days of free willing
finances are over.

16
00:02:19,225 --> 00:02:23,700
Changes in banking regulations mean
that our hands are now tied.

17
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,375
If we continue on this course,

18
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:30,425
we'll be forced to start selling
off our artistic patrimony

19
00:02:30,475 --> 00:02:33,000
simply to survive.

20
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,700
The faithful will return.

21
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,800
It's a natural cycle.

22
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,200
For now, the faithful
are not returning.

23
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,300
And small but dangerous enclaves
of Catholic fundamentalism

24
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,700
are starting to spring up,
just like in Islam.

25
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,100
Islam has more followers
than the Catholic Church.

26
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:59,750
Don't you find it a burden to take
on the responsibility

27
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,050
of such risky
and unpopular decisions?

28
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,825
No.

29
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,975
Your Holiness, who are you, really?

30
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:20,100
Therefore, by the authority
of the almighty God

31
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,000
of Saint Peter
and Paul and by our Own,

32
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,725
this venerable brother of ours,

33
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:33,700
we create and solemnly proclaim

34
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,450
of the Holy Roman Church,

35
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,350
Cardinal Bernardo Alonso Gutierrez.

36
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,875
Receive the ring
from the hands of Peter.

37
00:07:44,675 --> 00:07:49,375
And know that through the love
of the Prince of the Apostles

38
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:54,725
your love for the Church
is strengthened.

39
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,375
Push. Push more.

40
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:07,625
Push! Pushing, ok.

41
00:08:07,675 --> 00:08:09,550
Ok, Esther.

42
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,175
Ok, Esther.

43
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,875
Push more.

44
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:17,450
Push.
Very good, Very good.

45
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,400
Ok, Esther, ok, ok, ok.

46
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,875
Keep pushing, keep pushing now.

47
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:26,850
Ok.

48
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,000
Ok, ok.

49
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,500
Now let us offer the prayer

50
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:48,350
that Christ has given us
as the model of all prayers:

51
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:55,375
Kyrie ElÃ©ison.

52
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:02,725
Christe ElÃ©ison.

53
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:11,925
Kyrie ElÃ©ison.

54
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:19,175
Pater Noster, qui es in Caelis,

55
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:25,975
sanctificetur Nomen Tuum.

56
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:32,800
Adveniat Regnum Tuum.

57
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,700
Fiat voluntas Tua,

58
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:45,675
sicut in Caelo, et in Terra.

59
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,300
Panem nostrum quotidianum

60
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,625
da nobis hodie,

61
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:03,800
et dimitte nobis debita nostra,

62
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,575
sicut et nos dimittimus

63
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:15,250
debitoribus nostris.

64
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:24,475
Et ne nos inducas in tentationem,

65
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:33,175
sed libera nos a malo.

66
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,225
Let us pray.

67
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,350
The Pope told me
I would become a cardinal.

68
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:52,350
He didn't keep his promise.

69
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,250
I don't know...

70
00:11:55,825 --> 00:12:00,375
This Pope...

71
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,975
I don't know... I don't know...

72
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,375
But I know so many things...

73
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,550
If I were to speak...

74
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,875
I don't know...

75
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,300
And now it's time for me
to bid you all farewell.

76
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,925
I should have done it before,

77
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:28,600
but the Holy Father kept me in Rome

78
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:32,550
so I could begin work
on my new responsibilities.

79
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,950
I beg your pardon for only coming
back here after nine months to...

80
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,125
to say goodbye and turn right
around and head back to Rome.

81
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:49,325
But before I leave,

82
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:53,975
I'd like to introduce you to
the new bishop of San Pedro Sula,

83
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,750
Monsignor Jorge Aguero.

84
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,000
I know Monsignor Aguero very well.

85
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,725
He's a hero.

86
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,300
From this pulpit
he will shout at you

87
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,925
to forsake evil,
to fight against the gangs,

88
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,200
to say no to death,

89
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,300
to violence

90
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,650
and the narcotrafficking
that infests Honduras.

91
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,825
He will refuse to give communion
to crime bosses

92
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:29,625
and he will refuse to perform
weddings for their daughters.

93
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:37,500
Yes, he will do all the things
that I have failed to do.

94
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:44,375
Yes, because I'm not a hero.

95
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,100
Because...

96
00:13:49,425 --> 00:13:51,050
I'm afraid.

97
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,050
Like you.

98
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:05,500
Perhaps that is why you have
loved me, just a little. No?

99
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,750
Because I didn't make you
uncomfortable.

100
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,050
I never asked you to choose.

101
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:19,000
I never blackmailed you by saying
that in order to be good Christians

102
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,175
you had to let yourselves
be murdered

103
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:24,850
by the henchmen
of the drug cartels.

104
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,175
I loved you for the way you were...

105
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,800
not for the way you ought to be.

106
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,475
Now I bid you farewell.
I'm going to Rome.

107
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,150
But that's not going home for me.

108
00:14:46,225 --> 00:14:48,175
I want you to know that,

109
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:50,625
as far as I'm concerned,

110
00:14:50,675 --> 00:14:54,975
Honduras is and always will be

111
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,350
...my home.

112
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,850
Attention!

113
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,125
Flowers!

114
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,375
This is for the baby.

115
00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:52,075
Oh, you shouldn't have,
Holy Father.

116
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,550
It's a Bible that belonged to
Thomas Jefferson,

117
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,825
the President of the United States,

118
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:01,125
but it's like new,
he never opened it.

119
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,500
We certainly can't blame Jefferson,
the Bible isn't light reading.

120
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,150
We named him Pius.

121
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,675
A name for a bird.

122
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,425
He'll fly high!

123
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:28,625
Do you want to hold him,
Your Holiness?

124
00:17:28,675 --> 00:17:32,325
That really would be
an unusual experience for me.

125
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,625
And for Peter and I
would be an honor.

126
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:07,225
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Mr. Pius XIV.

127
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,500
It's a pity we can't remember
what we smelled like

128
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,650
when we were babies.

129
00:18:33,675 --> 00:18:37,650
I do remember
what my parents smelled like.

130
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,000
He takes after you.

131
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,925
But if you look closely,
he also takes a little...

132
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:48,325
No.
He's a very good-looking baby.

133
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,725
He resembles his mother.

134
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,100
Holy Father.

135
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,375
Forgive me. I'm such a fool.

136
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:03,000
My hands only know
how to bless people.

137
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,200
- It's all right, nothing happened.
- I'm such an idiot.

138
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,675
We all have to get used
to new things, Holy Father.

139
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:10,100
- Nothing happened.
- Yes, yes you're right, Peter.

140
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,800
Valente, was there something you
wanted to tell me?

141
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,675
Holy Father,
the Italian Prime Minister

142
00:19:14,725 --> 00:19:17,050
is waiting for you in the Vatican.

143
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:20,300
Of course, it had slipped my mind.

144
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,625
Esther, I must go.

145
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,550
In my head,
I'll be at this audience

146
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,750
but in my heart I'll
never have left this room.

147
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:47,625
It's surprising to see
how a young woman,

148
00:19:47,675 --> 00:19:52,400
just moments after having a child,
can be transformed into a mother.

149
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,500
Mr. Prime Minister, please allow me
to recommend extreme caution

150
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,775
with the Pope.

151
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:33,875
The information I've received

152
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:37,450
suggests that he's more
diabolical than saintly.

153
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,350
Excellent!
He's finally meeting his match.

154
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,700
Eminence!

155
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,825
Welcome, Mr. Prime Minister,
the Holy Father is expecting you.

156
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,625
- Thanks.
- This way please.

157
00:21:08,175 --> 00:21:10,050
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

158
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,675
Good morning.

159
00:21:12,725 --> 00:21:15,925
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

160
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,825
We'll be late for the audience!

161
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,000
Good morning.

162
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:33,400
Are you asleep, Holy Father?

163
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,500
No, Mr. Prime Minister.
I'm praying for you,

164
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:40,100
That's very thoughtful of you.

165
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,375
And thanks very much
for giving me this audience,

166
00:21:42,425 --> 00:21:44,650
after just nine months.

167
00:21:46,975 --> 00:21:50,550
I didn't think you'd be running
the Country this long.

168
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,750
I said to myself: why bother?

169
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,725
But I was wrong.

170
00:21:56,975 --> 00:22:02,225
Well, how is this Italy of ours
doing?

171
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:05,725
Much better, thanks to me.

172
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:06,875
- You think so?
- Yes.

173
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,800
I think just the opposite.

174
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,500
You wanna to do "much better",

175
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,900
perhaps you should keep firmly
in mind this list of requests.

176
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:22,375
I jotted it down in a hurry
just a few minutes ago.

177
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:26,300
If there's anything I've left off,
I can certainly add it to the list.

178
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,500
I make sure you receive
it promptly.

179
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:33,000
Greater assistance
to Catholic families,

180
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,900
no to common law marriages,

181
00:22:37,425 --> 00:22:39,550
no to gay marriages,

182
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,525
more money to Catholic schools,

183
00:22:42,575 --> 00:22:46,875
further tax and banking benefits
to the Holy See,

184
00:22:46,925 --> 00:22:49,750
absolute prohibition
of abortion in all cases,

185
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,600
absolute prohibition
of divorce in all cases,

186
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:57,675
no to any temptation
to accept euthanasia,

187
00:22:57,725 --> 00:22:59,875
restrictions
on the religious freedom

188
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:02,300
of Muslims and Hindus,

189
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,475
a reopening of discussions
on the Lateran Pacts,

190
00:23:08,525 --> 00:23:13,050
a full review of the territorial
boundaries of the Vatican State.

191
00:23:15,575 --> 00:23:19,500
This last request really is
remarkable, I have to admit.

192
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:23,550
I didn't know that you had
expansionistic ambitions.

193
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,725
But I was told before coming that
this new Pope is a very funny man.

194
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,725
But did they forget to inform you
that this new Pope

195
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:32,900
is a man who's
far more intelligent than you?

196
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,100
No. Because it isn't true.

197
00:23:38,475 --> 00:23:41,600
Do you know what the difference is
between me and you, Holy Father?

198
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,300
Let's hear.

199
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:48,475
The difference is that I was
elected with 41% of the votes.

200
00:23:48,525 --> 00:23:50,600
That 41% exists.

201
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,800
You were elected by God.

202
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,925
And it's not a sure thing
that God exists.

203
00:23:58,775 --> 00:24:01,100
Fine!

204
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:05,125
There's another element worthy
of your consideration:

205
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:08,500
just in case God
does happen to exist,

206
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,850
do you know how long
it would take Him to wipe

207
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,500
that 41% off the face of the earth?

208
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:20,450
And where will God eradicate
that 41%?

209
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,125
At the polls in the next election?

210
00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:26,175
Or in their homes
while they're watching TV?

211
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:28,600
Or perhaps in their sleep!

212
00:24:30,275 --> 00:24:33,225
At the polls in the next election.

213
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:38,850
And what's more:
I, as the vicar of Christ,

214
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,100
will be happy to help God
eradicating that 41%.

215
00:24:45,925 --> 00:24:49,525
And if don't stop
playing the idiot,

216
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,200
I'm gonna be forced to prove to you
that God does exists.

217
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,500
Let me explain something to you,
Holy Father.

218
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,450
- Please.
- Your demands

219
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,175
might have some basis in fact
at any other point in history.

220
00:25:06,225 --> 00:25:09,375
At a point in history
when the Church was stronger

221
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,175
than it is right now,

222
00:25:11,225 --> 00:25:14,650
the Italian political equation
would have been obliged

223
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,850
to take your demands
under serious consideration.

224
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,500
The way it always has in the past.

225
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:25,800
But now let us briefly analyze
your Papacy, Holy Father.

226
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:32,300
In the past nine months you have
never shown yourself to the faithful,

227
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,350
you have not recited a single
Angelus in St. Peter's Square,

228
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,550
you have not communicated
with anyone,

229
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,925
you have simply retreated
into your palace on the hill

230
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:45,225
and you have threatened and
terrorized the faithful,

231
00:25:45,275 --> 00:25:47,675
through your terse
and telegraphic communiquÃ©s

232
00:25:47,725 --> 00:25:49,400
in L'Osservatore Vaticano,

233
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,925
with obscurantist and retrograde theses.

234
00:25:52,975 --> 00:25:54,725
The result has been that,

235
00:25:54,775 --> 00:25:58,750
according to a number
of highly respected studies,

236
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,425
Italian Catholics have turned away
from the Church en masse.

237
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:10,625
This new development not only
allows me to ignore your requests,

238
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,500
but it gives me
an even greater opportunity:

239
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,125
finally to modernize Italy.

240
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:22,175
Without fear of retaliation
or the risk

241
00:26:22,225 --> 00:26:25,000
of losing support among voters,
I can review the colossal fraud

242
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,775
of the eight per thousand Church
tax, finally imposing

243
00:26:27,825 --> 00:26:32,575
punitive taxes on the dioceses,

244
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,200
and, most important of all,

245
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,175
I can finally free the country
from the pork barrels,

246
00:26:37,225 --> 00:26:40,500
stumbling blocks, and vetoes
of the Holy Roman Church

247
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:43,725
in the areas of euthanasia,
common law marriages,

248
00:26:43,775 --> 00:26:47,375
gay couples, abortion,
scientific research.

249
00:26:47,425 --> 00:26:50,475
To cut a long story short,
Holy Father,

250
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,600
thanks to you I can start
a revolution.

251
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,650
A very persuasive speech.

252
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,925
I'm glad we're finally beginning
to talk sense.

253
00:27:03,975 --> 00:27:07,100
Persuasive and stupid,

254
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,575
I might add, like every
politicians' speech.

255
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:13,975
And what's more, unrealizable.

256
00:27:14,775 --> 00:27:17,200
Unrealizable?

257
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,100
We shall see about that!

258
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:22,000
Now, if you'd care to listen to me,

259
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,550
I'll show you that God exists,

260
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,175
and how God and I can annihilate
that 41% of the population

261
00:27:29,225 --> 00:27:33,525
that makes you feel so cheerful
and full of yourself.

262
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,300
I am very eager to hear what you
have to say, Holy Father.

263
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,375
I'm glad.

264
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:42,175
You see, Mr. Prime Minister,

265
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:47,300
in the Sixties the young people
that protested in the streets

266
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:51,700
spouted all kind of heresies,
all except one:

267
00:27:52,525 --> 00:27:54,600
power to the imagination.

268
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,500
In that, they were correct.

269
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:02,275
The only problem was they had
no imagination.

270
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,800
And neither do you.

271
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,875
But God and I have plenty.

272
00:28:07,925 --> 00:28:13,350
God and I are simply dripping
with imagination.

273
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,475
Now, just try and imagine
something with me:

274
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,425
in six months, Italy will hold
the general elections,

275
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:29,500
and you will try to maintain
or increase

276
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:33,275
your 41% share of the electorate.

277
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:35,575
And right now everything indeed

278
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:39,350
points to your ability
to maintain that 41%.

279
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,225
- Yeah.
- But just imagine,

280
00:28:41,275 --> 00:28:45,300
a few weeks before the election,
it comes an announcement.

281
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:51,050
Pope Pius XIII has decided
to appear in public

282
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,825
for the very first time.

283
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,175
To talk to the Italian Catholics.

284
00:28:59,175 --> 00:29:01,175
What morbid curiosity!

285
00:29:01,225 --> 00:29:05,150
The whole world
is dying of curiosity.

286
00:29:05,925 --> 00:29:08,600
And it is absolutely
to be expected,

287
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:12,850
it's normal, we all want to see
that which is hidden,

288
00:29:13,725 --> 00:29:17,175
we all want to stare
the forbidden in the face.

289
00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:23,825
Pius XIII appears and so
do his beautiful blue-eyes...

290
00:29:24,775 --> 00:29:27,850
and this soft, round mouth.

291
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,625
A dazzling image,
so dazzling it blinds people.

292
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:37,075
In other words, a powerful,
an evocative image,

293
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,875
not unlike that of Christ.

294
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:42,250
But Pius XIII
doesn't merely dazzle,

295
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,650
he offers reassurance as well.

296
00:29:45,225 --> 00:29:50,300
With a magnificent speech,
full of quotations in Latin,

297
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:56,650
it tells them that they,
the faithful, must not be afraid.

298
00:29:58,225 --> 00:30:01,500
And how could they be afraid,
with a Pope as handsome

299
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,550
and reassuring as Christ?

300
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:09,425
Last of all, just a few short
weeks before the elections,

301
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:13,225
the Pope says just two words:

302
00:30:14,475 --> 00:30:16,900
"non expedit".

303
00:30:21,725 --> 00:30:23,600
- Do you know what that means?
- No.

304
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,175
No, of course you don't.
You're far too young.

305
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:31,600
The "non expedit" was first issued
by Pius IX in 1868.

306
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,875
It was eliminated by Benedict XV
in 1919,

307
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,225
but guess what I can do?

308
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,750
What I, who am not answerable
to 41% of the Italians,

309
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,000
but only to God who, by the way,
does not express His displeasure

310
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,925
on social networks
if I make a mistake.

311
00:30:54,525 --> 00:30:56,600
Guess what I can do?

312
00:30:57,275 --> 00:31:00,350
I can restore the "non expedit".

313
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:05,025
The Catholics will all rush
to Google those words.

314
00:31:06,925 --> 00:31:08,800
What do they mean?

315
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:15,775
The "non expedit" means
that the Holy Father

316
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,800
decrees it is unacceptable
for Catholics

317
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:25,300
to vote in the Italian elections.

318
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,900
And do you know what the surveys
that you have commissioned tell us?

319
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:38,050
They tell us that the number
of Italians who identify themselves

320
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:43,500
as Catholics are 87.8%
of the population.

321
00:31:45,275 --> 00:31:50,050
Now you may say to me:
they could simply disobey you.

322
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,375
True.

323
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:56,875
But while a Catholic
might disobey the Pope,

324
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,825
they'd never disobey Christ.

325
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,050
I'm already the former,

326
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,850
but believe me, if I want to,

327
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,925
I can have myself accredited
as the latter as well,

328
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:15,550
and when I do,
you'll lose your election.

329
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,375
Here's how it works:

330
00:32:18,425 --> 00:32:23,300
since you get 31% of your votes
from the Catholic electorate,

331
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:29,450
ah, you'd wind up with
a mere 10%.

332
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,875
I wouldn't be so sure
of those numbers, if I were you.

333
00:32:51,475 --> 00:32:54,175
Mr. Prime Minister,

334
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,575
take a look in this mirror.

335
00:33:03,175 --> 00:33:04,950
What do you see?

336
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,800
Two young men.

337
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,725
One of whom is dressed
in a slightly odd style.

338
00:33:11,775 --> 00:33:16,100
I, on the other hand,
see two media events.

339
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:21,800
One has already taken place,
that's you.

340
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,400
The other is about to happen.

341
00:33:32,975 --> 00:33:35,250
Now, having set out

342
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,600
to prove to you
the existence of God,

343
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,950
I believe I'm done.

344
00:33:59,225 --> 00:34:01,450
But in that case, why...

345
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,725
why haven't you appeared
in public yet?

346
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:12,725
Because there's still no need.

347
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:23,200
You weren't all that wrong:
this Pope is diabolical.

348
00:34:26,975 --> 00:34:28,600
Good morning.

349
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,500
This Pope is a saint.

350
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:33,550
I can say that much after
my meeting with the Holy Father.

351
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,125
A warm, productive
and stimulating meeting.

352
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,975
Nonetheless,
substantial disagreements

353
00:34:40,025 --> 00:34:42,000
remain with the Holy See.

354
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:45,475
The Italian government,
despite the Pontiff's misgivings,

355
00:34:45,525 --> 00:34:48,775
will continue the efforts to
legalize common law marriages,

356
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:52,300
no matter what the sexual
orientation is.

357
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,050
And, as you know,

358
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,975
the revision of the eight per
thousand Church tax is approaching

359
00:34:56,025 --> 00:34:59,225
and will be the subject of our
next cabinet meeting.

360
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:02,600
Holy Father, would you like me
to see what I can do

361
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:06,000
to mend the relations
with the Italian Government?

362
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,300
- He's bluffing.
- Who?

363
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,325
The young man in a hurry who's
speaking on TV right now.

364
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,500
He's selling smoke and mirrors.

365
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,425
He won't do a thing he says.

366
00:35:15,475 --> 00:35:18,300
Holy Father,
I've read the draft bills

367
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,925
that have already been approved
by the various commissions.

368
00:35:22,975 --> 00:35:25,825
These people are deadly serious.

369
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,625
The revision of the eight
per thousand Church tax

370
00:35:28,675 --> 00:35:32,225
would threaten the survival
of the Italian bishops.

371
00:35:33,525 --> 00:35:35,725
Would that be such a bad thing?

372
00:35:35,775 --> 00:35:39,600
What do we care?
You and I are the Holy See.

373
00:35:40,475 --> 00:35:43,125
The Italian bishops
can take care of themselves.

374
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:46,625
Holy Father, I beg you,
this is no laughing matter.

375
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:48,675
Rest easy, he's bluffing.

376
00:35:48,725 --> 00:35:51,750
Holy Father, believe me,
political awareness

377
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,975
is an archetypal emotion
for the Secretary of State.

378
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:02,225
Soccer mania is an archetypal
emotion for the Secretary of State.

379
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,050
I want to let you know that I've
been working hard on something new.

380
00:36:11,675 --> 00:36:13,250
On what?

381
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,750
A measure forbidding priests
from giving absolution

382
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,175
in the confessional
to women who have had abortions.

383
00:36:19,225 --> 00:36:24,000
Its a kind of soft,
disguised form of excommunication.

384
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:28,600
Holy Father, we will wake up
and find the women of the world,

385
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,000
led by the Femen, rushing
the walls of the Vatican,

386
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,500
hammers in hand,
bent on destruction.

387
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:40,450
Fine. We'll rebuild those walls,
taller and finer.

388
00:36:44,675 --> 00:36:48,725
Old and unreliable Rorschach tests

389
00:36:48,775 --> 00:36:54,125
orders to investigate intrusively
into the past of aspiring priests,

390
00:36:54,175 --> 00:36:57,850
young men paid bounties
to lure those aspiring priests

391
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,000
into compromising sexual situations

392
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,100
as soon as they're allowed
out into the world.

393
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,600
That's what I read in the directive
I found on my desk this morning,

394
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:12,500
drawn up by who knows what renegade
underling while I was in Honduras.

395
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,650
Drawn up by me!

396
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,675
Every candidate for priesthood
takes a vow of chastity.

397
00:37:21,725 --> 00:37:23,925
Their sexual predilections
are irrelevant.

398
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,750
Every candidate for priesthood

399
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,975
takes a vow of chastity
and none of them respect them.

400
00:37:29,025 --> 00:37:31,350
That's the truth.

401
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,900
Well, I'm telling you no.

402
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,050
Lenny, I'm not okay with this.

403
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,750
I didn't go looking for my parents.

404
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,375
Instead, I went back
to the orphanage,

405
00:37:45,425 --> 00:37:47,850
in order to be with my friend
Andrew Dussolier,

406
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,800
who was all I had left
in the world.

407
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,625
That was the beginning.

408
00:37:58,225 --> 00:38:02,600
You owe me, as a friend,
as a man of the cloth

409
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:07,125
who acknowledges my authority,
you must do what I ask.

410
00:40:09,025 --> 00:40:12,175
Here you are: Sanchez Angelo.

411
00:40:13,175 --> 00:40:17,300
My superiors have determined
that you are neither suited for

412
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:20,475
nor worthy of the priesthood.

413
00:40:20,525 --> 00:40:23,850
You are prohibited from requesting
admission to a seminary,

414
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,375
in your home diocese
or in any other, for seven years.

415
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:31,700
Why?

416
00:40:32,725 --> 00:40:38,250
Put in simpler terms, the sexual
disturbances afflicting you

417
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,850
are unacceptable
in terms of our standards.

418
00:41:16,525 --> 00:41:17,975
What do you want?

419
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:21,150
Your resignation.

420
00:41:23,225 --> 00:41:24,650
Otherwise...

421
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:29,525
our order will threaten a schism.

422
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,875
A schism?

423
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,200
Just try it.

424
00:41:49,725 --> 00:41:53,375
I'll strip you of all you have.

425
00:41:53,425 --> 00:41:54,675
Everything.

426
00:41:54,725 --> 00:41:58,775
Your beds, your tunics,
your underpants,

427
00:41:58,825 --> 00:42:02,175
all those wonderful monasteries
you have in the most wonderful,

428
00:42:02,225 --> 00:42:05,125
loveliest places on earth.

429
00:42:05,175 --> 00:42:08,100
Because all that belongs to me.

430
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,125
Are you ready to live on the
street? Like St. Francis of Assisi?

431
00:42:14,175 --> 00:42:16,225
Are you ready to sleep
on the ground,

432
00:42:16,275 --> 00:42:21,400
kicked and spat upon by junkies,
and homeless people, and drunks?

433
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:25,700
I'm ready to wage a war
without end against you.

434
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,975
Are you ready to wage that war,

435
00:42:28,025 --> 00:42:31,500
armed with nothing
but bottomless poverty?

436
00:42:40,675 --> 00:42:42,775
I don't think so.

437
00:42:42,825 --> 00:42:46,050
And in that case,
stop talking bullshit

438
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,000
and get yourselves some shoes,

439
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:50,850
because the air
in here is unbreathable.

440
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,500
Angelo Voiello?

441
00:43:03,925 --> 00:43:05,100
Oh, Jesus!

442
00:43:05,775 --> 00:43:07,325
Who sent you? Pius XIII?

443
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:09,550
No, Raffaele Esposito,
the magistrate.

444
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,425
Captain Becchi is here and he would
like to ask you a few questions.

445
00:43:12,475 --> 00:43:15,500
And I'll be happy to provide
him with some answers.

446
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,550
This is for you.

447
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,925
Read it!

448
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,575
What do you recommend?

449
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:43,100
Father Antonello did a great job
with "A Great Little Soul",

450
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,850
So did Liliana with "A Man"...

451
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,800
I'll take "1001 Illustrious Names
Blackmailed by Angelo Voiello."

452
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,650
There, only there.

453
00:44:01,025 --> 00:44:02,950


454
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,525
May I have some cane sugar?

455
00:44:06,575 --> 00:44:08,625
We don't have any cane sugar,
Captain.

456
00:44:08,675 --> 00:44:12,500
Eminence, do you have any idea
why I'm here?

457
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:15,350
The owner of the
"Er Core de Roma" restaurant

458
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,925
must have filed
a complaint against me.

459
00:44:17,975 --> 00:44:21,250
Last week he claimed that Maradona
is still on drugs,

460
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,425
and I really lashed out at him.

461
00:44:23,475 --> 00:44:26,175
I said: "You ugly shit,
don't you dare

462
00:44:26,225 --> 00:44:28,100
take the Lord's name
in vain again."

463
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:31,500
No, Your Eminence, we're here about
Tonino Pettola. Do you know him?

464
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,200
- Who?
- Tonino Pettola.

465
00:44:35,925 --> 00:44:40,725
Ah, yes. Of course,
I know his reputation,

466
00:44:40,775 --> 00:44:41,750
a lousy reputation, let me add.

467
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,475
He's a notorious con artist
who claims he can pick out

468
00:44:45,525 --> 00:44:49,000
the Blessed Virgin Mary
amid his flock of sheep.

469
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:51,800
The Congregation for the Causes
of Saints has repeatedly

470
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:53,500
and vehemently rejected
his applications.

471
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,425
Have you ever met him personally?

472
00:44:56,475 --> 00:44:57,800
Never.

473
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,225
Pettola's relatives claim
the exact opposite.

474
00:45:01,275 --> 00:45:02,675
They say that Tonino Pettola,

475
00:45:02,725 --> 00:45:06,850
one evening a few months ago,
in his home

476
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,875
met with you,
the Pope and other Cardinals.

477
00:45:09,925 --> 00:45:11,725
From that moment
on he seemed shocked

478
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:15,000
and obsessed with your meeting
because they say

479
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:18,925
that you threatened to throw
him in quicksand.

480
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,250
Does it strike you as plausible,
Captain,

481
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,975
that the Cardinals,
the Secretary of State and the Pope

482
00:45:24,025 --> 00:45:26,175
would all go
to Tonino Pettola's house

483
00:45:26,225 --> 00:45:28,500
and threaten
to throw him in quicksand?

484
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:33,275
It does seem strange
but not implausible.

485
00:45:33,325 --> 00:45:35,750
Why? What happened
to Tonino Pettola?

486
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,300
He disappeared.

487
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:39,875
His relatives claim
he was being persecuted

488
00:45:39,925 --> 00:45:43,100
by persons high up in the Vatican.

489
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:47,125
Do you really think we'd waste
our time on a poor raving lunatic?

490
00:45:47,175 --> 00:45:50,000
That poor man had followers
all around the world

491
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,375
and was about
to found his own Church.

492
00:45:52,425 --> 00:45:54,000
He's not the only one, Captain.

493
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:55,500
At least two crazies pop up every day.

494
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:59,000
If the Vatican were to persecute
and threaten them all,

495
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:00,750
it wouldn't have time to do
anything else.

496
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,350
Phone records reveal that numerous
calls from inside the Vatican

497
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,600
were made to Pettola.

498
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:09,500
I believe it.

499
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:11,800
People are always making
calls from the Vatican.

500
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:14,875
I've been fighting for years
against such wasteful behavior.

501
00:46:14,925 --> 00:46:18,125
Waste is not the point,
Your Eminence.

502
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:20,425
Don't you think
it's a contradiction?

503
00:46:20,475 --> 00:46:24,625
If Pettola was
an insignificant artist

504
00:46:24,675 --> 00:46:26,400
and you had no interest in him,
why all the phone calls?

505
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,250
The Congregation for the Causes
of Saints was in contact with him,

506
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,900
doing their best to check
his urgent demands.

507
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,425
The calls not only came

508
00:46:34,475 --> 00:46:37,125
from the Congregation
for the Causes of Saints

509
00:46:37,175 --> 00:46:41,450
but also from Your Eminence's
offices and from the Pope's.

510
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,475
In the Secretary of State
and the Pope's offices

511
00:46:44,525 --> 00:46:47,425
there are about 250 employees.

512
00:46:47,475 --> 00:46:50,950
I can't rule out that someone
might have had a reason

513
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
to call Tonino Pettola.

514
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:57,950
Perhaps someone that believed all
his fibs and wanted to meet him.

515
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,125
Do you have any idea where
Tonino Pettola might be?

516
00:47:01,175 --> 00:47:06,550
He's probably in some far-flung
monastery praying and repenting.

517
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,225
You have an answer for everything,
Eminence.

518
00:47:10,275 --> 00:47:12,400
That's my job, Captain.

519
00:47:19,725 --> 00:47:23,300
- I've heard the same thing.
- What, Captain?

520
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:27,000
That Maradona is still doing drugs.
A friend of mine told me.

521
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:29,850
He's in intelligence
and stationed in Dubai.

522
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,375
Why do you want to hurt me,
Captain? Why?

523
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:40,775
Because I'm a fan of Inter,
Your Eminence.

524
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,500
Cardinal Dussolier,

525
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,950
I know you,
but you don't know me.

526
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,250
I'm Contessa Emma Meraviglia,
the wife of General Meraviglia.

527
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,550
Good evening.

528
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,525
You know, I don't like seeing you
all on your own.

529
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,725
I'm accustomed to it, signora.

530
00:48:15,775 --> 00:48:17,850
That's a bad custom to get into.

531
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,725
My girlfriends would compete
to keep you company.

532
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:23,250
And so would I.

533
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,425
In any case, my husband and I
will be hosting a party

534
00:48:26,475 --> 00:48:28,500
Thursday at our villa.

535
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:32,400
If you're at loose ends,
please come.

536
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:35,475
It would be an honor
for my husband and me.

537
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,625
Ok, thank you.
I'll keep it in mind.

538
00:48:39,675 --> 00:48:40,725
Bye.

539
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:01,325
My name is Angelo Sanchez.

540
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,900
I was born in Alicante
into a family of manual laborers

541
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:10,175
and I am not a homosexual.

542
00:49:10,925 --> 00:49:14,350
I had such a simple dream:
to serve God.

543
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:18,200
You murdered my dream.

544
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,125
You are nothing more
than a pathetic,

545
00:49:23,175 --> 00:49:25,500
miserable, cowardly murderer.

546
00:50:21,575 --> 00:50:25,025
I could have been
an excellent priest.

547
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,375
Yeah, you could have.

548
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:49,175
I want to go home.

549
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:01,050
What do you mean, home?

550
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:03,950
We're both orphans.

551
00:51:06,775 --> 00:51:09,425
- You too?
- Me too.

552
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,750
I was abandoned by my parents
when I was just three years old.

553
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:19,950
Children are so lovely
when they are three years of age.

554
00:51:20,975 --> 00:51:24,350
How can anyone abandon a three year old?

555
00:51:25,175 --> 00:51:27,250
Where do you find the nerve?

556
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:31,000
I never knew you were an orphan,
too.

557
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:34,075
Well... now you know.

558
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:38,600
- Does Lenny know?
- No.

559
00:51:39,425 --> 00:51:41,075
And he never will.

560
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:42,800
Why not?

561
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:49,975
Because you don't steal
the stage from the Pope.

562
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:55,075
And you don't interfere
with his sorrow.
