1
00:00:10,618 --> 00:00:12,992
God isn't for you Lenny.

2
00:00:13,576 --> 00:00:17,242
God is for men
who have no use for freedom.

3
00:00:19,534 --> 00:00:21,659
You're wrong about abortion.

4
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:25,909
You're spreading a sorrow
you don't even understand.

5
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:30,242
And that's the worst thing
a human being can do.

6
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:34,159
You've made the kind of mistake
that should be avoided at all costs

7
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,909
introducing concepts that taken
by themselves are true,

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,492
but which, when locked together,

9
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:42,659
constitute
a system that's overly rigid.

10
00:00:45,742 --> 00:00:49,534
When it comes to abortion,
rigidity is the only option:

11
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,159
there's no getting around it.

12
00:00:52,242 --> 00:00:53,992
It's a crime,

13
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:59,159
forbidden and punished in the book
of Exodus Chapter 21, verses 22-25,

14
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:00,867
you know that.

15
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:06,492
22: "When men have a fight
and injured a pregnant woman

16
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:09,783
and she suffers a miscarriage, but
no further injury,

17
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:12,075
the guilty one shall be fined

18
00:01:12,117 --> 00:01:15,618
as much as the woman's husband
demands and he shall pay

19
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,075
in the presence of the judges".

20
00:01:18,117 --> 00:01:22,699
23: "But if injury ensues,
you shall pay life for life,

21
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:28,284
24, "eye for eye, tooth for tooth,
hand for hand, foot for foot."

22
00:01:29,242 --> 00:01:33,825
25 "burn for burn, wound for wound,
stripe for stripe."

23
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:39,367
The Church has always maintain
this tradition and

24
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:44,825
it is only modern laxity that
wishes to turn sins into rights:

25
00:01:47,034 --> 00:01:49,576
not to encourage them,

26
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:52,700
no one is actually
in favor of abortion,

27
00:01:52,783 --> 00:01:55,867
but to undermine
the principle of authority.

28
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,992
Oh, come on Lenny,

29
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:01,618
you know these verses are a little
more complicated than that:

30
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:05,367
yes the litigant pays damages
in case of an abortion

31
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:10,326
or suffers death if the woman dies
in the course of losing the baby,

32
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:13,242
but that's not what it is about,

33
00:02:13,326 --> 00:02:16,284
this is about compassion, empathy.

34
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:17,742
Bouvier?

35
00:02:17,783 --> 00:02:21,451
Are you seriously going to waste my
time with the Bouvier's nonsense?

36
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:24,034
Post-revolutionary France?

37
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:25,992
Or the bullshit of St. Alphonsus?

38
00:02:26,034 --> 00:02:28,576
It isn't bullshit, Lenny:

39
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:30,992
that abortion
is a "grave moral disorder"

40
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:33,825
is not open for debate.

41
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:38,659
That's what St. John Paul II said,
and those three words, grave,

42
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:42,326
moral and disorder are based
on papal infallibility.

43
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:48,742
And yet, in 1591, Pope Gregory XIV,

44
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:53,117
with the Sedes Apostolica bull

45
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:57,909
restricted excommunication to
the abortion of an ensouled fetus,

46
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:01,534
introducing a distinction

47
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:06,576
that argues against lumping
together differing situations.

48
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:11,284
I'm sick and tired of distinctions.

49
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:13,825
Even for St. Thomas Aquinas,

50
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:16,534
and right up until the middle of
the nineteenth century,

51
00:03:16,618 --> 00:03:21,159
abortion was set to take place only
after the ensoulment of the fetus,

52
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,201
and that occurs
in the third month of pregnancy.

53
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:27,534
Science is the gift of God

54
00:03:27,576 --> 00:03:31,409
and God taught us
that ovulation is spontaneous.

55
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:33,451
Ask a woman about that:

56
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,159
back when it was still believed
that there were two kinds

57
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:40,326
of insemination, male
insemination involving sperm,

58
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:42,783
female insemination involving eggs,

59
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:46,326
it was considered a sin not to give
a woman pleasure:

60
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:50,576
but then, when it was discovered
that ovulation was spontaneous,

61
00:03:50,618 --> 00:03:55,242
the cost was several billion
female orgasms.

62
00:03:56,075 --> 00:03:58,992
But it made
the psychoanalysts rich.

63
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:03,534
The one profession that involves
no work and a great deal of money

64
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,700
that we let slip
through our fingers.

65
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:11,451
I implore you Lenny,

66
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:14,783
reconsider
your position on abortion.

67
00:04:14,825 --> 00:04:18,367
Tough in principle,
soft in practice.

68
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:31,492
Abortion is saying no to life.

69
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:37,117
Who gives a damn about life?

70
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:43,699
Life is not a stupid centerpiece
on the side table of nothingness.

71
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:49,909
Life is meant to be used, and to
be used well, to love and be loved.

72
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:55,409
And let me remind you what
St. Alphonsus said about abortion:

73
00:04:55,534 --> 00:05:00,367
in an abortion everyone is guilty,
except for the woman.

74
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:07,576
And what if that wasn't only true
of abortion?

75
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:12,576
What if in the things of life,
everyone is guilty,

76
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:14,699
except for the woman?

77
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:24,492
Are you talking about your mother?

78
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:28,034
Who else would I be talking about?

79
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:12,992
What is happening to me today?

80
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:15,699
At ten o'clock, Robert Lee,
the new chairman of the Tea Party.

81
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,992
At 11:15, a brief meeting with the
chancellor of Stanford University;.

82
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:20,468
At one o'clock, lunch
with the governor

83
00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:22,742
to fine-tune plans
for the evening's events.

84
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:25,909
How long has it been
since you've seen your father?

85
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:28,885
He's no longer my father,
he's only my governor.

86
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:30,742
Don't you miss him?

87
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,618
He doesn't miss me,
I don't miss him.

88
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:36,326
I miss everyone.

89
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:40,117
But more than anyone else,
the person I miss is

90
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,451
Mr. Jack Walser,

91
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:46,451
he was the superintendent
of the building where we lived,

92
00:07:46,492 --> 00:07:48,909
before the Lord called me to Him.

93
00:07:49,242 --> 00:07:52,576
He had divided the tenants
into two categories,

94
00:07:53,618 --> 00:07:55,576
the "natives" and the "nomads".

95
00:07:58,783 --> 00:08:04,576
One day, Jack rang our door bell
at ten in the morning,

96
00:08:06,492 --> 00:08:09,367
confident that Lucy and I
would be at school,

97
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:13,950
but that day we were in bed
sick with a fever,

98
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,909
happy to be safe at home.

99
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:25,700
Through the bedroom door I saw my
mother offer him a cup of coffee,

100
00:08:25,742 --> 00:08:27,950
which Jack drank it standing up,

101
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:29,742
because he didn't want
to get the chair wet

102
00:08:29,783 --> 00:08:33,326
with his rain-drenched clothes.

103
00:08:35,117 --> 00:08:36,992
No doubt, there was something bad

104
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:40,034
he'd come to say,
something important.

105
00:08:41,242 --> 00:08:45,409
And then, Mr. Walser announced
to my mother that the landlords

106
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:51,909
had decided to implement
a substantial rent hike with...

107
00:08:55,825 --> 00:08:57,742
with a caress.

108
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:00,783
Yeah...

109
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:07,576
With a caress
that never really happened

110
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:11,492
but that still come close to

111
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:15,867
brashing against my mother's
drab hair, to my hair,

112
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:22,492
to Lucy's and the hair of our
father lying in a hotel

113
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:25,492
somewhere in the city
with his lover in his arms.

114
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:27,699
Listening to the rain...

115
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:33,201
the way we were.

116
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:38,909
We "nomads" moved out
the apartment at night,

117
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,201
so we wouldn't being seen by,
by the "natives",

118
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:48,992
but at the bottom of the stairs
Mr. Walser was waiting,

119
00:09:49,034 --> 00:09:52,992
and he shook our hands, one by one,

120
00:09:53,742 --> 00:09:56,284
and he said something to me
that I've never understood,

121
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:58,742
which is why I still remember it.

122
00:10:00,326 --> 00:10:05,783
He said to me "Always get a seat
in the back of the train,

123
00:10:07,742 --> 00:10:10,451
because it's the safer".

124
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:21,326
Why does our Spanish persecutor
not go home to his Pope?

125
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:23,409
I couldn't say.

126
00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:25,326
What does he doing here?

127
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:30,117
He walks, he drinks, he sleeps,
he drinks, he walks, he drinks.

128
00:10:30,618 --> 00:10:34,451
Ah, he's battling against death,

129
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:37,451
which is the least interesting
of any of the battles

130
00:10:37,492 --> 00:10:39,783
we have ever summoned to fight.

131
00:10:52,242 --> 00:10:53,867
It's too late.

132
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:56,699
It's too late for what?

133
00:10:57,492 --> 00:11:00,326
For everything, Your Eminence.

134
00:11:14,618 --> 00:11:18,909
Hello, Pete,
have you five minutes for me?

135
00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:22,992
Sure, Father Gutierrez.

136
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:26,700
I was just wondering if you'd had
a chance to think it over.

137
00:11:26,783 --> 00:11:29,034
Yeah, I've thought it over.

138
00:11:29,742 --> 00:11:33,534
I'm not gonna press charges
against Archbishop Kurtwell.

139
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,742
Why, why not?

140
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:40,618
None of the others filed charges,

141
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,700
but at least
they got plenty of cash.

142
00:11:42,742 --> 00:11:45,093
- You didn't even get that.
- And have you ever asked yourself

143
00:11:45,117 --> 00:11:48,576
why they took the money
and I didn't?

144
00:11:48,618 --> 00:11:50,909
No, I haven't. Why didn't you?

145
00:11:52,284 --> 00:11:54,909
Because I have my dignity.

146
00:11:56,409 --> 00:11:58,117
Fine.

147
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:03,409
So if you have so much dignity,

148
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:05,867
file charges against that man.

149
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:08,492
That man is evil incarnate.

150
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:14,201
Why are you crying, now?
Pete, you know I'm right.

151
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:16,242
Bernardo.

152
00:12:16,284 --> 00:12:18,242
Can I call you Bernardo?

153
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:19,992
Yes, of course you can.

154
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,825
Forget about me.

155
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,201
Hi, Freddy.

156
00:12:47,492 --> 00:12:49,201
Ciao, Bernardo.

157
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:01,659
How is training coming along?

158
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:04,950
I've been gradually intensifying.

159
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,326
Nice.

160
00:13:08,326 --> 00:13:10,618
Did you think over my proposal?

161
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:12,576
What proposal?

162
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:16,659
What do you mean, what proposal?

163
00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:20,909
The idea of you giving me a hand
in nailing Kurtwell.

164
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,534
- That worm just drools
when he sees you. - Not me.

165
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:31,659
I drool when I see you, Bernardo.

166
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:39,783
All you'd have to do
is go out with him one night.

167
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:43,242
You could just stop before things
went too far,

168
00:13:44,576 --> 00:13:48,950
and in the meantime I'd find
a hiding place and take pictures.

169
00:13:48,992 --> 00:13:53,201
Freddy, Freddy,
you're my last hope.

170
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:56,010
Bernardo, you are gonna leave
here when you're done.

171
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:59,867
But I have to spend the rest
of my life here, do you understand?

172
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:01,867
I can't afford to cross
a man like Kurtwell.

173
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,284
He's one of the most powerful men
in Queens.

174
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:06,825
You can understand that, right?

175
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:14,367
Don't resent me for it, Bernardo.

176
00:14:15,284 --> 00:14:17,451
I never resent anyone.

177
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:19,992
That's my main problem.

178
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:14,825
Hello, Freddy.

179
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:22,326
What do you want, Freddy?

180
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,367
Just tell me what you want
and you'll have it.

181
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:28,742
I want to become a great tennis
player and win the Grand Slam.

182
00:15:29,492 --> 00:15:32,409
Fine, then you'll have it.

183
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,659
Get out of here, asshole.

184
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:46,117
But...

185
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:06,618
They've told me the date.

186
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:08,367
It's for next week.

187
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:13,659
It's just one day of the year,
Rose, an ordinary date.

188
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:16,618
They're going to empty me out,
Bernardo.

189
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:23,659
They've given me a 60% chance
of dying, 40% chance of living.

190
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,659
And if I refuse,

191
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,867
I can't even begin to guess
my life expectancy.

192
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,284
But I'm not gonna refuse,

193
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:41,950
because I need to start
running in this hotel again

194
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:46,159
and I can't keep doing
it from here,

195
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:49,699
through six silent
security monitors.

196
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:56,409
Isn't it nice to live silent
and flat on your back?

197
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:59,242
No, it's horrible.

198
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:03,618
We all deserve the right
to start over, Bernardo.

199
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:09,909
But you know
what the funny thing is?

200
00:17:09,992 --> 00:17:11,367
What is it?

201
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:14,201
How I'll leave this place.

202
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,992
How will you leave?

203
00:17:19,284 --> 00:17:20,783
Through there.

204
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:30,075
They're going to tear down
the wall,

205
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:34,034
turn it all into
one giantic window,

206
00:17:34,492 --> 00:17:40,534
and out I'll go, dangling
in midair, lifted by a crane.

207
00:17:43,992 --> 00:17:46,783
It'll be a spectacular sight.

208
00:17:47,492 --> 00:17:49,950
I'll be so ashamed.

209
00:17:52,534 --> 00:17:54,326
I have to go now.

210
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,742
I'm going to write to the Pope.

211
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:03,492
It sounds so surreal,
when you put it that way.

212
00:18:45,117 --> 00:18:47,034
I'd like to put together
a press release

213
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:50,117
categorically denying the rumors
about murky relations

214
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:52,492
between you and Kurtwell.

215
00:18:52,618 --> 00:18:55,075
A press release that states
loud and clear:

216
00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:58,534
this Pope is blackmail proof.

217
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:02,950
If, as you say, this Pope
is blackmail proof,

218
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:04,909
then there's no need to say so.

219
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,659
That's the point, Holy Father.

220
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:11,699
On a strictly confidential basis,
I need to know myself:

221
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,659
can Kurtwell blackmail you
in any way?

222
00:19:48,117 --> 00:19:49,825
Lenny...

223
00:19:55,699 --> 00:19:58,075
you think you're the hinge.

224
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:04,867
But you're the door.

225
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:51,659
...ventris tuis.
Sancta Maria, Mater Dei...

226
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:30,159
I love you all!

227
00:21:36,576 --> 00:21:40,242
Where have Esther, Peter,
and little Pius gone?

228
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:42,326
To Ostia.

229
00:21:43,326 --> 00:21:46,534
They're living in a house
by the beach.

230
00:21:47,117 --> 00:21:50,950
Peter is
a private security guard now.

231
00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:56,825
Weren't they happy here?

232
00:21:58,576 --> 00:22:00,783
Holy Father...

233
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:05,867
life in the Vatican is not much fun
for young people.

234
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:13,242
Holy Father?

235
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,367
Yes.

236
00:22:15,783 --> 00:22:19,699
Everyone here says
that you are a saint.

237
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,950
Calumny!

238
00:22:40,034 --> 00:22:42,034
Show me where you live.

239
00:23:40,742 --> 00:23:44,075
When you want to,
you can come home.

240
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:51,618
But I haven't accomplished anything
with Kurtwell.

241
00:23:53,492 --> 00:23:55,909
Doesn't matter. Come home.

242
00:23:56,825 --> 00:23:58,326
I'll be waiting.

243
00:24:07,117 --> 00:24:09,659
Archbishop, your diocese
is currently undertaken

244
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:12,618
numerous projects
and revitalize the neighbourhood.

245
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,909
Can you give us
more details about that?

246
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,034
Well, we have put
a lot of money and time

247
00:24:19,075 --> 00:24:21,159
over the years
on this neighbourhood.

248
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:24,242
and I think that through sports,
well,

249
00:24:24,284 --> 00:24:29,201
we'll be able to make contact
with the youths on the area and,

250
00:24:29,242 --> 00:24:31,284
and to help instill in them

251
00:24:31,326 --> 00:24:34,451
some of the values
consistent with Christian life.

252
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:38,075
Among the many sports projects
that your diocese supports,

253
00:24:38,117 --> 00:24:39,284
many involved tennis.

254
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:43,825
- Why tennis specifically?
- Oh well, I, I love tennis.

255
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:46,326
It's been a lifelong
passion of mine,

256
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:49,783
and you probably didn't know
but this area is very famous

257
00:24:49,825 --> 00:24:51,409
for tennis for a long time,

258
00:24:51,451 --> 00:24:53,992
and I think that tennis
just offers a chance

259
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,075
for excellence instructions
of a man soul.

260
00:24:57,117 --> 00:25:01,075
The elements of tennis
are concentration, self-worth,

261
00:25:01,117 --> 00:25:04,034
and a lot of things that go in to
making a great tennis-player.

262
00:25:04,075 --> 00:25:07,326
And you know it's the
responsibility of the Church

263
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,992
to help these children to grow up.

264
00:25:10,034 --> 00:25:14,618
Hic est enim calix sanguinis mei,

265
00:25:15,117 --> 00:25:19,992
novi et aeterni testamenti
mysterium Fidei.

266
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:24,367
Qui pro vobis
et pro multis effundetur

267
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:27,326
in remissionem peccatorum.

268
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:30,992
Haec quotiescumque feceritis,

269
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,783
in mei memoriam facietis.

270
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:51,618
Yes, I'd like to.

271
00:25:53,576 --> 00:25:54,909
Ok.

272
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:51,159
What's your name?

273
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,034
David.

274
00:26:54,867 --> 00:26:56,451
David what?

275
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:58,534
Just David.

276
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:18,284
Why are you following me?

277
00:27:22,242 --> 00:27:29,034
I used to skate only on the
weekends, and only with my family.

278
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:36,117
Then one night we were having
dinner and my daughter Kate,

279
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:39,992
who was twelve at the time,

280
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:43,409
says that that meal...

281
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:47,159
was like being in a shark tank.

282
00:27:48,201 --> 00:27:52,159
That's what my wife and I
had become: a shark tank.

283
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:57,326
Now I skate alone,

284
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,159
even during the week, but...

285
00:28:03,117 --> 00:28:05,576
it's not the same anymore.

286
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:13,659
Tanistone is my last name.

287
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:18,326
And it was my mother's
last name too.

288
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:21,326
Why are you following me?

289
00:28:23,825 --> 00:28:26,284
Haven't you discovered yet?

290
00:28:28,242 --> 00:28:32,742
You're the missing link between me
and the source of all my problems.

291
00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:15,399
What's going on?

292
00:29:57,442 --> 00:30:01,817
Why are you and the Holy Father
so determined to get me?

293
00:30:02,483 --> 00:30:04,151
Because for years you were
so determined

294
00:30:04,234 --> 00:30:07,151
to get all those innocent children.

295
00:30:08,901 --> 00:30:10,775
That is infamous slander

296
00:30:10,817 --> 00:30:14,109
and I could bring you up
on charges tomorrow morning.

297
00:30:14,151 --> 00:30:16,609
You don't have any solid evidence
against me.

298
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,318
What else do you want?

299
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,400
What does Pius XIII want from me?

300
00:30:20,442 --> 00:30:23,399
The Holy Father wants from you a
statement that resembles the truth.

301
00:30:23,483 --> 00:30:26,609
The truth is
I know Lenny Belardo very well.

302
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,276
We shared power
in New York for years.

303
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,276
And the truth is
he has always envied me.

304
00:30:33,318 --> 00:30:37,318
He envies me my charisma,
because he lacked that quality.

305
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:39,918
That is the one and only statement
that resembles the truth.

306
00:30:39,942 --> 00:30:41,984
Be, be reasonable, please.

307
00:30:47,026 --> 00:30:49,984
The Pope has no reason to envy
a sick old priest

308
00:30:50,026 --> 00:30:53,276
who's devastated
by very grave accusations.

309
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:57,775
Your thesis doesn't hold together.

310
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:04,151
Let me reveal something to you,
Father Gutierrez: you don't matter.

311
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,318
Not at all.

312
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:08,151
You can stay in Queens
until the day I die,

313
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:10,109
but it won't change a thing.

314
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:11,918
The Pope can't get to the bottom
of things with me

315
00:31:11,942 --> 00:31:14,442
and he knows it perfectly well.

316
00:31:14,525 --> 00:31:17,483
Because it would mean
the pure pandemonium.

317
00:31:20,984 --> 00:31:23,525
I pity you, Gutierrez,

318
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:25,609
because you're just a bit player

319
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:29,318
in a cheap piece of amateur
theatricals organized by your Pope.

320
00:32:14,901 --> 00:32:16,151
David...

321
00:32:18,859 --> 00:32:20,817
...is Kurtwell your father?

322
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:25,359
Do you remember that girl
that was skating, this evening?

323
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,400
That was a moment.

324
00:32:28,442 --> 00:32:32,567
Because only you and I saw it,
out of the whole world.

325
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:34,901
I felt close to you.

326
00:32:34,942 --> 00:32:39,483
I sensed that your despair
was the same as mine.

327
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:42,942
That was the moment I thought
to myself:

328
00:32:44,234 --> 00:32:45,984
I trust this man.

329
00:32:55,984 --> 00:33:00,400
Yes, I, I thought,
here's a good man.

330
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,775
And I'm a good man, too.

331
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:10,151
So I'll tell that good man
the things he wants to know.

332
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:17,442
Yes, Kurtwell...

333
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:21,775
...is my father.

334
00:33:24,692 --> 00:33:27,901
But that's not the point.

335
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:32,399
The point is the horror.

336
00:33:57,067 --> 00:33:59,775
I'm not afraid of dying,

337
00:34:00,318 --> 00:34:03,109
but because I suffer from vertigo,

338
00:34:03,483 --> 00:34:06,359
I'm afraid of being swung
out of this place

339
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,400
through that hole in the wall

340
00:34:08,442 --> 00:34:11,567
and being dangled in mid-air.

341
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:13,400
Don't worry.

342
00:34:14,276 --> 00:34:16,650
I'll be there to comfort you.

343
00:34:19,234 --> 00:34:21,734
Then I'll go back to Rome.

344
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:33,400
- You're going back to Rome?
- Yes.

345
00:34:33,483 --> 00:34:36,151
I'm done with my work here.

346
00:34:38,984 --> 00:34:41,567
You come say goodbye to me now.

347
00:34:41,609 --> 00:34:44,276
But I'm not leaving yet.

348
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:47,609
No, no,
you come say goodbye to me now.

349
00:35:14,067 --> 00:35:15,901
Breathe, Bernardo,

350
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:19,442
I'm the one who's going to die.

351
00:35:21,276 --> 00:35:22,984
- Rose, please...
- Bernardo,

352
00:35:23,026 --> 00:35:25,817
we're breathing the same air.

353
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:46,067
All of you, leave now.

354
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:13,234
No, not you, Lenny.

355
00:36:36,483 --> 00:36:38,775
Tell it to me,

356
00:36:41,525 --> 00:36:43,650
just this one time.

357
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:52,359
Let me die knowing I didn't believe
in God in vain.

358
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,817
Tell it to me, Lenny.

359
00:37:04,817 --> 00:37:06,276
All right.

360
00:37:37,276 --> 00:37:39,192
Let's go say hello to Billy.

361
00:37:39,234 --> 00:37:42,151
- I'd rather not. I'm scared.
- But we must.

362
00:37:42,192 --> 00:37:43,609
Billy is a friend of yours.

363
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:47,234
His mother is dying and he needs
the comfort you can give him.

364
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:02,151
Thanks for coming, Sister Mary.
Please.

365
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:18,400
Billy, your friends are here.

366
00:38:36,276 --> 00:38:38,942
Come, let me get you something.

367
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:02,817
Sister Mary, can I go see Billy's
mother for a minute?

368
00:39:02,901 --> 00:39:04,609
I'd like to pray beside her.

369
00:39:09,276 --> 00:39:10,567
Of course.

370
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,483
Lord, we must talk
about Billy's mother now.

371
00:39:54,276 --> 00:39:56,942
We must talk, You and I.

372
00:39:57,026 --> 00:39:59,026
And no one else can hear.

373
00:42:22,234 --> 00:42:25,442
Billy's mother is still alive.

374
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:32,901
Your mother is still alive too.

375
00:42:35,817 --> 00:42:37,692
And you'll find her.

376
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:54,567
Now...

377
00:42:57,234 --> 00:42:59,192
at last...

378
00:43:02,525 --> 00:43:04,984
...time to die.

379
00:45:56,359 --> 00:45:57,859
Bring me back.

380
00:45:58,775 --> 00:46:00,399
Bring me back.

381
00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:27,775
To what do I owe the honor
of your presence?

382
00:46:27,817 --> 00:46:30,984
I have orders to accompany you
to the Vatican,

383
00:46:31,026 --> 00:46:33,942
where you'll be given a fair trial.

384
00:46:33,984 --> 00:46:36,692
We have a flight for Rome
tomorrow afternoon.

385
00:46:36,734 --> 00:46:39,067
It'll only be a big waste of time.

386
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:41,567
For me and for you.

387
00:46:41,609 --> 00:46:44,609
You don't have any solid evidence,
you and your Pope.

388
00:46:45,399 --> 00:46:47,109
None.

389
00:46:47,442 --> 00:46:50,859
Only the demented reaving
of a lunatic

390
00:46:50,901 --> 00:46:52,859
who goes around with orange hair.

391
00:46:52,942 --> 00:46:54,734
No one will believe you.

392
00:46:54,775 --> 00:46:56,525
No one.

393
00:46:56,567 --> 00:46:59,318
We don't just have that testimony.

394
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:01,734
Really?

395
00:47:02,151 --> 00:47:04,692
What else do you think you have?

396
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:47,400
This is Kurtwell...

397
00:47:47,692 --> 00:47:49,525
Hello, Lenny.

398
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:50,751
Even though you let it
ring and ring,

399
00:47:50,775 --> 00:47:53,692
I know that you were waiting
for my call.

400
00:47:53,775 --> 00:47:56,734
Do you really want me to come
to Rome to be subjected to a trial

401
00:47:56,775 --> 00:47:58,359
and found guilty?

402
00:47:58,399 --> 00:48:01,442
I'm afraid
it's absolutely necessary.

403
00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:05,525
Then one second after I land
in Rome,

404
00:48:05,567 --> 00:48:07,483
you are gonna see all the things
I have on you

405
00:48:07,525 --> 00:48:10,192
on all the newspapers of the world.

406
00:48:10,817 --> 00:48:12,567
Go right ahead.

407
00:48:13,067 --> 00:48:15,192
The world would probably like it.

408
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:18,359
The world is always ready for love.

409
00:48:47,567 --> 00:48:51,525
This is Archbishop Kurtwell.
Is this a bad time?

410
00:48:51,609 --> 00:48:53,067
That depends.

411
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:57,483
I have some confidential
information about the Pope.

412
00:48:57,525 --> 00:48:58,859
And I have proof.

413
00:48:58,901 --> 00:49:01,442
To be perfectly frank,
it's more than information,

414
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:04,399
these are ticking time bombs.

415
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:09,276
In that case, this is a very good
time, especially for a journalist.

416
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:11,525
What's the subject?

417
00:49:11,567 --> 00:49:14,234
I'm not talking about it
on the phone.

418
00:49:32,151 --> 00:49:34,483
Do you see the kind of things
we're talking about here?

419
00:49:34,525 --> 00:49:36,859
Letters that our Pope
wrote to his...

420
00:49:36,901 --> 00:49:39,609
Californian girlfriend
over the years.

421
00:49:40,109 --> 00:49:43,859
We have a Pope with
a very active emotional life.

422
00:49:46,399 --> 00:49:47,859
Where did you find them?

423
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:52,192
I took over a position that was
previously held by Belardo.

424
00:49:52,234 --> 00:49:53,859
I took over his desk.

425
00:49:53,901 --> 00:49:55,775
Belardo made the error of

426
00:49:55,817 --> 00:49:59,026
leaving these letters
at the back of a drawer.

427
00:49:59,859 --> 00:50:03,650
- Have you read them all?
- Only the pertinent passages.

428
00:50:03,692 --> 00:50:04,859
The steamy ones.

429
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:10,567
The ones that prove that Belardo
has had a woman for years.

430
00:50:12,192 --> 00:50:15,734
You should have read them all,
and with care.

431
00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:19,567
In this last one, he states
he'll never send these letters

432
00:50:19,609 --> 00:50:23,026
to that woman
because he's married to God.

433
00:50:24,399 --> 00:50:26,734
Do you have any evidence
that they were mailed?

434
00:50:26,775 --> 00:50:29,567
Any envelopes with canceled stamps?

435
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:33,067
No, no, I don't.

436
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:40,026
Well, in that case, my good
Archbishop Kurtwell,

437
00:50:40,067 --> 00:50:42,942
you don't have any news for me.

438
00:50:43,026 --> 00:50:44,942
No bomb. No scandal.

439
00:50:44,984 --> 00:50:48,276
A stack of love letters that were
never mailed isn't news.

440
00:50:48,984 --> 00:50:51,399
It's strictly literature.

441
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:12,567
Pack the bags, call the chauffeur.

442
00:51:14,399 --> 00:51:16,399
You no longer have a car.

443
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:20,775
I put in a request
to have it confiscated.

444
00:51:20,817 --> 00:51:24,734
The Cardinal Secretary of State
accepted my request.

445
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:29,400
We're going to take the train
to the airport.

446
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,067
On one condition.

447
00:51:36,483 --> 00:51:38,609
What condition?

448
00:51:39,151 --> 00:51:42,525
That we sit in the last car
on the train.

449
00:51:44,525 --> 00:51:46,234
It's the safest.

450
00:52:38,525 --> 00:52:41,026
What is more beautiful, my love?

451
00:52:41,067 --> 00:52:44,609
Love lost or love found?

452
00:52:46,234 --> 00:52:48,276
Don't laugh at me, my love.

453
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:52,318
I know it, I'm awkward and naive,

454
00:52:52,359 --> 00:52:54,399
when it comes to love,

455
00:52:55,192 --> 00:52:58,442
and I ask questions
straight out of a pop song.

456
00:53:02,609 --> 00:53:07,067
This doubt overwhelms me
and undermines me, my love.

457
00:53:08,984 --> 00:53:11,276
- To find...
- Hey, Daniel.

458
00:53:11,318 --> 00:53:12,609
...or to lose?

459
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:13,525
How I look?

460
00:53:13,567 --> 00:53:15,942
All around me,
people don't stop yearning.

461
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:19,026
Did they lose or did they find?

462
00:53:19,067 --> 00:53:20,942
I can't say.

463
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:26,399
An orphan has no way of knowing.

464
00:53:26,692 --> 00:53:30,984
An orphan lacks a first love.
The love for his mama and papa.

465
00:53:31,026 --> 00:53:35,525
That's the source of his
awkwardness, his naivetÃ©.

466
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:41,109
You said to me, on that deserted
beach in California,

467
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:45,151
"you can touch my legs."

468
00:53:45,734 --> 00:53:47,650
But I didn't do it.

469
00:53:48,817 --> 00:53:51,817
There, my love, is love lost.

470
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:57,026
That's why I've never stopped
wondering, since that day:

471
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,151
where have you been?

472
00:53:59,984 --> 00:54:02,399
And where you are now?

473
00:54:03,151 --> 00:54:07,525
And you, shining gleam
of my misspent youth,

474
00:54:08,399 --> 00:54:11,359
did you lose or did you find?

475
00:54:14,109 --> 00:54:15,525
I don't know.

476
00:54:16,151 --> 00:54:18,276
And I will never know.

477
00:54:19,525 --> 00:54:23,483
I can't even remember your name,
my love.

478
00:54:24,483 --> 00:54:27,109
And I don't have the answer.

479
00:54:27,984 --> 00:54:31,984
But this is how I like
to imagine it, the answer.

480
00:54:34,192 --> 00:54:38,109
In the end, my love,
we have no choice.

481
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:41,234
We have to find.

482
00:54:51,692 --> 00:54:53,609
All right love bugs.

483
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:56,692
Mommy is gonna show you something
that you didn't know mommy can do.

484
00:54:56,734 --> 00:54:58,859
Ok.... ok, ready to catch?

485
00:54:58,901 --> 00:55:00,483
Here you go.

486
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:08,000


487
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:15,000
