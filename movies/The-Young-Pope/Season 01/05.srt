1
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,125
- Where is he now?
- He's angry.

2
00:02:50,175 --> 00:02:52,525
But not with you,
or for that matter with me.

3
00:02:52,575 --> 00:02:55,175
His anger keeps Him from viewing
matters objectively.

4
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:58,275
And so, in protest,
he's moved to a new place,

5
00:02:58,325 --> 00:03:00,125
he's gone to the outskirts of town,

6
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:04,675
a filthy studio apartment upstairs
from a tire repair shop.

7
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:07,100
At night,
God suffers from the heat.

8
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,550
He can't seem to sleep, because
He's come to the conclusion

9
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,225
that there's nothing He can do
about human beings.

10
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:15,725
He's decided that He's lost the u.

11
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:20,175
Now it's up to you.

12
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,800
The attentions that Your Holiness
has been paying to the wife

13
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:30,775
of the commandant of the Swiss
Guard have not gone unnoticed.

14
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:34,425
According to vox populi,

15
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:37,100
it is believed that the Holy Father

16
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,475
is conducting an unseemly
relationship with that woman.

17
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:44,025
Monsignor Gutierrez was right:

18
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:47,450
in the Vatican,
gossip is called calumny.

19
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,525
Your Holiness,
what do you intend to do?

20
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:59,225
Revolution, Tommaso!

21
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:03,900
I intend to start a revolution.

22
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,400
People say you're a saint.

23
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,725
People say you're a saint
who performs miracles.

24
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:14,575
Hail Mary, full of grace.

25
00:06:51,275 --> 00:06:55,250
Our Lord is with Thee.

26
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,250
Blessed art Thou among women,

27
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,475
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

28
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:08,275
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

29
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,400
pray for us sinners,

30
00:07:16,475 --> 00:07:18,525
now and at the hour of our death.

31
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,125
Amen.

32
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,325
Bingo!

33
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:06,525
Now, Holy Father,

34
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,350
I no longer really know
what miracle to wish for.

35
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:29,350
I no longer really know
what miracle to wish for.

36
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,025
Esther,

37
00:08:37,425 --> 00:08:42,225
I love God because it is so painful
to love human beings.

38
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:47,400
I love a God that never leaves
or that always leaves me.

39
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,025
God or the absence of God,

40
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:58,300
but always reassuring
and definitive.

41
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,225
I am a priest,

42
00:09:04,475 --> 00:09:07,500
I have renounced my fellow man,

43
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,200
my fellow women,

44
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,700
because I don't want to suffer,

45
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,400
because I'm incapable

46
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,725
of withstanding
the heartbreak of love,

47
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,300
because I'm unhappy,

48
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,525
like all priests.

49
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:45,625
It would be wonderful to love you
the way you want to be loved,

50
00:09:49,075 --> 00:09:51,025
but it's not possible.

51
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,225
Because I am not a man.

52
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,050
I am a coward.

53
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,400
I am a coward.

54
00:10:03,725 --> 00:10:06,150
Like all priests.

55
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,850
That's enough photos for now.

56
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,050
Watch out for the custodian.

57
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:50,975
- Are you up for going on?
- I am. What about you?

58
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:53,850
- Sister Mary will be upset.
- I don't care.

59
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,300
I wanna find my mom and dad.

60
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,650
- I'm going back. I'm sorry, Lenny.
- Ok.

61
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:40,300
You couldn't get to sleep!

62
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,675
The evening doesn't console me.

63
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:45,975
Nothing's changed, as you can see.

64
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:47,300
Well, something's changed.

65
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,650
You were just a jerk,
now you've become the Pope.

66
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:55,425
Let's smoke a cigarette together,
secretly.

67
00:14:55,475 --> 00:14:57,550
- Like when we were kids.
- Like when we were kids.

68
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:04,800
I'm glad that you find a moment
to say hello to me.

69
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,525
How could you doubt that I'd come?

70
00:15:06,575 --> 00:15:08,150
I always doubt.

71
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,900
When are you gonna make this
blessed speech to the cardinals?

72
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,275
When I have something to say.

73
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,525
Well, I'm all out of cigarettes.

74
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:45,225
The Holy Father isn't
in the Apostolic Palace.

75
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:48,075
Nor is the Cardinal
Secretary of State.

76
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,275
What time is it?

77
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:54,025
Three in the morning.

78
00:15:54,075 --> 00:15:55,400
I'll take care of it.
You go to sleep.

79
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,800
And don't say a word to anyone.

80
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,575
- Will you let me in?
- Of course. - Thank you.

81
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:39,825
You are very beautiful
at night, Sister Mary.

82
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,225
Please...

83
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,975
Let me introduce you to
my best friend, Girolamo.

84
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:56,550
- Is he a good friend? - Yes, the
only one who never criticizes me.

85
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,725
- Why did you come here?
- Because of the Pope.

86
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:01,200
How disappointing!
I thought you came because of me.

87
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,150
Nobody knows where the Pope is.

88
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,725
Oh don't worry.

89
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:10,850
Sooner or later all popes need
to remind themselves

90
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,525
what freedom is.

91
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:15,925
Then they come back.

92
00:17:15,975 --> 00:17:17,725
We had to go to retrieve
Pius XIII's predecessor

93
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:19,725
from a bingo parlor.

94
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:24,300
He was arguing with the caller,
saying he was cheating.

95
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,850
When you want, you know
how to be quite comforting.

96
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,650
How beautiful you are,
Sister Mary, at night.

97
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:38,900
You already told me that.

98
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,700
We love God
because it is so painful

99
00:17:44,225 --> 00:17:46,800
to love other men and women.

100
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:53,775
You and I have renounced
our fellow men, and women,

101
00:17:53,825 --> 00:17:56,425
because we don't want to suffer,

102
00:17:56,475 --> 00:18:00,650
because we're incapable

103
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,850
of withstanding
the heartbreak of love.

104
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,050
Because we're unhappy.

105
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,400
Because we're cowards.

106
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,175
Like all priests and all nuns.

107
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,175
Your words are beautiful.

108
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:17,475
But that's not all.

109
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:20,325
They're true.

110
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,075
They are not my words,
they're the words of your Pope.

111
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,575
Yes, yes, Girolamo,
now I'll tell Sister Mary.

112
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,375
What are you going to tell me?

113
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,925
That I had found a way of
destroying the Holy Father.

114
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:39,100
I'd collected all the evidence
for a good old-fashioned scandal.

115
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,850
But I'm not going to do it!

116
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:49,050
The evidence is in here.

117
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,550
Here, you take it.

118
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,300
Your hands are safer than mine.

119
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,225
Because,
you know something, Sister Mary?

120
00:18:57,275 --> 00:19:00,400
You were right, your Pope
really is a saint.

121
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,275
Yes.

122
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:07,800
He is!

123
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,100
- Good evening, Sir.
- Hi.

124
00:19:11,475 --> 00:19:12,975
Would you sell us
some cigarettes?

125
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:20,450
I don't know if we have any.

126
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:24,275
Make yourselves comfortable
and I'll go check.

127
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:26,275
Thank you.

128
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:29,275
Andrew!

129
00:19:29,325 --> 00:19:30,325
Please, take a sit.

130
00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:51,150
English?

131
00:19:55,075 --> 00:19:57,075
Americans.

132
00:20:05,525 --> 00:20:07,375
You look like a couple of priests.

133
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,050
We are not priests.

134
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,200
Have you ever seen two priests
wearing track suits?

135
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,775
I've seen everything.

136
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:28,425
By the way, did you know I have
clients who insist I am proof

137
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:30,675
of the existence of God?

138
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,625
Interesting theory!

139
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:40,950
But they are wrong.

140
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,025
They see me
because they can't see far.

141
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,850
Can you see far?

142
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:07,650
Yes.

143
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:13,350
And I have proof
of the existence of God.

144
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,225
Show me, ma'am.

145
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:20,100
Show me, I implore you.

146
00:21:24,475 --> 00:21:25,950
Your eyes...

147
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,675
Your eyes, sir.

148
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,450
They are proof
of the existence of God.

149
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,150
We should go.

150
00:21:52,225 --> 00:21:54,450
Goodnight, ma'am.

151
00:22:04,525 --> 00:22:05,325
Do you remember the time...

152
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,025
Sister Mary took us
to the custodian's house?

153
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:30,000
Billy's mother, on her deathbed?

154
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,525
Yeah, I remember.
I don't wanna talk about it.

155
00:22:34,575 --> 00:22:37,125
It's pointless for you to go on
pretending nothing happened, Lenny.

156
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,525
Something extraordinary
happened in that room.

157
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:49,775
I don't feel like talking about it.

158
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:53,175
You're my best friend
and I don't understand you.

159
00:22:53,225 --> 00:22:55,300
Why don't you wanna talk about it?

160
00:22:57,525 --> 00:22:59,775
I only want to talk
about things that I understand.

161
00:22:59,825 --> 00:23:01,850
Don't you get that?

162
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,125
So, what if I asked you
to become Prefect

163
00:23:06,975 --> 00:23:08,600
for the Congregation
for the Clergy?

164
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,400
Select the candidates for
priesthood from all over the world:

165
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,500
would you do it?

166
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:26,275
And what if I were to refuse?

167
00:23:26,325 --> 00:23:28,300
Then I'd be forced to make recourse
to my sovereign power.

168
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,350
I am the Pope, now.

169
00:23:32,075 --> 00:23:35,350
I wanna tell you something.

170
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,525
It's something
I've never told you before.

171
00:23:52,475 --> 00:23:54,450
So tell me now.

172
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,550
When you first
came to the orphanage,

173
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,225
I was watching...

174
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:12,400
from a window,

175
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,050
and I don't remember your father,

176
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,150
but I remember your mother.

177
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,150
What did she look like?

178
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,675
Her hair was parted in the middle
long and on the sides...

179
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,100
and her eyes...

180
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,900
were bright...

181
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,600
and... impassive,

182
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,150
which made me think she was sad.

183
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:51,275
That's exactly how I dream of her.

184
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:56,000
Always.

185
00:24:59,225 --> 00:25:01,275
Why didn't you ever tell me?

186
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,275
When we were boys, I thought,

187
00:25:06,075 --> 00:25:08,225
I thought it would cause you
too much pain.

188
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,350
It causes me too much pain
even now.

189
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:18,000
Did you want to run away?

190
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,950
Come on, let's go back inside.

191
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,950
I haven't said anything to
the Cardinal Secretary of State.

192
00:26:39,775 --> 00:26:42,000
Thank you so much, Sister Mary.

193
00:27:10,425 --> 00:27:13,450
Monsignor, I forgive you for
having betrayed our confidences

194
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,000
to the Cardinal Secretary of State.

195
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:08,200
Your Holiness,
how did you find out?

196
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,825
I forgive you
for being an alcoholic

197
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:15,200
and I recommend you stop drinking

198
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,700
now that you're about to set off on
a challenging mission to America.

199
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,450
Your Holiness, what else
do you know about me?

200
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,325
I know everything a powerful man
needs to know

201
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:29,750
about the people he works with.

202
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,150
And I, not Voiello,

203
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,725
am the most powerful man of all.

204
00:28:34,775 --> 00:28:38,000
And what else do you know about me,
Holy Father?

205
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,775
What else is there to know?

206
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,950
You always talk to me
about my holiness,

207
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,850
the miracle
I've supposedly performed,

208
00:29:18,725 --> 00:29:22,700
but you never tell me anything
about the only miracle I need,

209
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:26,075
the miracle that doesn't happened
and never will:

210
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:31,750
seeing my parents again.

211
00:29:32,825 --> 00:29:35,525
You must have faith in God,
Your Holiness,

212
00:29:35,575 --> 00:29:38,350
and you'll see them again.

213
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,175
I'm getting old.

214
00:29:45,775 --> 00:29:48,125
Time is turning into a thin sheet,

215
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,100
and seeing them dead
is of no interest to me.

216
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,850
I'm only interested in the living.

217
00:29:58,075 --> 00:30:02,875
Holy Father,

218
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:06,875
I beg you to reconsider
your decision

219
00:30:47,175 --> 00:30:49,000
to send to America
Monsignor Gutierrez.

220
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,125
The Kurtwell case
needs to be examined

221
00:30:52,175 --> 00:30:56,175
by a person
of substantial reputation.

222
00:30:56,225 --> 00:30:59,125
Gutierrez is not up to it.

223
00:30:59,175 --> 00:31:03,400
He has none
of the necessary expertise,

224
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,875
and moreover he's fragile
and emotional,

225
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:12,250
and the Holy See will send
the world the message

226
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,650
that it does not take seriously
the problem of child abuse or,

227
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,750
even worse,
is not interested in it.

228
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,925
And there is another problem.

229
00:31:25,975 --> 00:31:29,500
I didn't want to tell you,
but now I'm forced to:

230
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,800
Your Holiness,
Gutierrez is an alcoholic.

231
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:40,025
I know.

232
00:31:40,075 --> 00:31:45,100
And there is also another secret.

233
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,825
What if I knew that one too?

234
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,900
What if I knew all your secrets,
Your Eminence?

235
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,175
What were you hoping to achieve?

236
00:32:01,575 --> 00:32:07,450
Start a scandal?

237
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,475
The idea of threatening that poor
girl, who suffers from sterility!

238
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:20,275
Will you stop at nothing,
Your Eminence?

239
00:32:20,325 --> 00:32:25,850
Don't you know the meaning
of the word pity?

240
00:32:26,425 --> 00:32:29,350
How far were you willing to go?

241
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,900
Would you have blackmailed
the Holy Father?

242
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,175
Would you have gone so far as to
give those pictures to the press,

243
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,600
to insinuate a nonexistent
sexual relationship

244
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:42,450
between me and that young woman?

245
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,625
You haven't figured out
that your old methods

246
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:49,350
only work on the old popes,

247
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:53,200
who were afraid
of losing consensus.

248
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,300
They don't work with me.

249
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,075
I am the young pope.

250
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,425
I put no stock in consensus.

251
00:33:04,925 --> 00:33:07,250
Who told...

252
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,050
Who told you all these things?

253
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:13,675
You put on airs as a politician,

254
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,325
You still haven't figured
out you've run up against

255
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:20,650
a politician far cannier than you.

256
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,975
Me.

257
00:33:24,025 --> 00:33:26,750
Holy Father, I've already destroyed
those pictures.

258
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,950
It's true, I was thinking
of using old, violent methods,

259
00:33:32,325 --> 00:33:36,500
but I repented in time,
Holy Father.

260
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:41,725
I repented before I could sin.

261
00:33:41,775 --> 00:33:44,825
The wonderful words that you said
to that young woman illuminated me.

262
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:47,650
I implore you, forgive me.

263
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:53,425
- I need your forgiveness.
- You don't need my forgiveness.

264
00:33:53,925 --> 00:33:58,750
You need my compassion.

265
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,900
Now stop making a spectacle
of yourself and get off.

266
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,225
Holy Father, the papal tiara
has arrived from Washington,

267
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:07,675
it's in perfect condition.

268
00:34:07,725 --> 00:34:09,775
Prepare the Sistine Chapel.

269
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:16,100
The time has come
to address the cardinals.

270
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:21,675
They're still there.

271
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,075
I'm going to turn around,
and they'll still be there.

272
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,100
I'm going to turn around now,
and I'll see them:

273
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:43,975
mom and dad waiting for me.

274
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:47,400
"Knock knock!"

275
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,225
"Knock knock!"

276
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:29,775
We're not in.

277
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,525
Brother cardinals,
from this day forward,

278
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,600
we're not in, no matter who's
knocking on our door.

279
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:44,050
We're in, but only for God.

280
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,750
From this day forward,
everything that was wide open

281
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,050
is gonna be closed.

282
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,050
Evangelization.

283
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,100
We've already done it.

284
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,125
Ecumenicalism.

285
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,650
Been there, done that.

286
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,175
Tolerance.

287
00:40:10,225 --> 00:40:12,600
It doesn't live here anymore.

288
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,325
It's been evicted.

289
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:18,350
It vacated the house
for the new tenant,

290
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,800
who has diametrically
opposite tastes in decorating.

291
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:24,425
We've been reaching out
to others for years now.

292
00:40:24,475 --> 00:40:28,700
It's time to stop!

293
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:36,825
We are not going anywhere.

294
00:40:39,825 --> 00:40:41,675
We are here.
Because, what are we?

295
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,500
We are cement.

296
00:40:46,725 --> 00:40:49,675
And cement doesn't move.
We are cement without windows.

297
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,200
So, we don't look
to the outside world.

298
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:57,500
"Only the Church possesses
the charisma of truth",

299
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:00,650
said St. Ignatius of Antioch.

300
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:08,225
And he was right.

301
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,025
We have no reason to look out.

302
00:41:13,075 --> 00:41:14,850
Instead, look over there.

303
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,150
What do you see?

304
00:41:18,825 --> 00:41:23,200
That's the door.

305
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,475
The only way in.

306
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,950
Small and extremely uncomfortable.

307
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,175
And anyone who wants to know us
has to find out

308
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:46,000
how to get through that door.

309
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,100
Brother cardinals, we need
to go back to being prohibited.

310
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,425
Inaccessible and mysterious.

311
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:58,950
That's the only way we
can once again become desirable.

312
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:03,550
That is the only way
great loves stories are born.

313
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,400
And I don't want
any more part-time believers.

314
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:11,350
I want great love stories.

315
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,600
I want fanatics for God.

316
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:17,775
Because fanaticism is love.

317
00:42:17,825 --> 00:42:23,900
Everything else
is strictly a surrogate,

318
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,825
and it stays outside the church.

319
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:31,700
With the attitudes
of the last Papacy,

320
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:45,100
the church won
for itself great expressions

321
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:47,450
of fondness from the masses.

322
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,825
It became popular.

323
00:42:54,925 --> 00:42:58,025
Isn't that wonderful,
you might be thinking!

324
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:03,225
We received plenty of esteem
and lots of friendship.

325
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,425
I have no idea what to do with the
friendship of the whole wide world.

326
00:43:11,475 --> 00:43:16,225
What I want is absolute love
and total devotion to God.

327
00:43:17,075 --> 00:43:20,425
Could that mean
a Church only for the few?

328
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:23,900
That's a hypothesis,

329
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:27,250
and a hypothesis isn't
the same as reality.

330
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,350
But even this hypothesis
isn't so scandalous.

331
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,975
I say: better to have a few
that are reliable

332
00:43:33,025 --> 00:43:37,400
than to have a great many that
are distractible and indifferent.

333
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:40,650
The public squares
have been jam-packed,

334
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,025
but the hearts
have been emptied of God.

335
00:43:45,675 --> 00:43:47,450
You can't measure love
with numbers,

336
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,175
you can only measure it
in terms of intensity.

337
00:43:51,225 --> 00:43:55,025
In terms of blind loyalty
to the imperative.

338
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:02,525
Fix that word firmly in your souls:

339
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:06,125
Imperative.

340
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:13,500
From this day forth,
that's what the Pope wants,

341
00:44:14,425 --> 00:44:17,850
that's what the Church wants,

342
00:44:19,675 --> 00:44:22,700
that's what God wants.

343
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:28,275
And so the liturgy will no longer
be a social engagement,

344
00:44:28,325 --> 00:44:30,475
it will become hard work.

345
00:44:30,525 --> 00:44:34,350
And sin will no longer
be forgiven at will.

346
00:44:37,825 --> 00:44:40,650
I don't expect any applause
from you.

347
00:44:42,275 --> 00:44:45,275
There will be no expressions
of thanks in this chapel.

348
00:44:46,025 --> 00:44:50,075
None from me.

349
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,575
And none from you.

350
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,375
Courtesy and good manners
are not the business of men of God.

351
00:44:57,425 --> 00:45:01,000
What I do expect...

352
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:06,625
is that you will do
what I have told you to do.

353
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:10,425
There is nothing outside
your obedience to Pius XIII.

354
00:45:11,325 --> 00:45:13,175
Nothing except Hell.

355
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:16,475
A Hell you may know nothing about,
but I do.

356
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:22,950
Because I've built it,
right behind that door:

357
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,525
Hell.

358
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,575
In the past few days,
I've had to build Hell for you,

359
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:38,150
that's why I've come
to you belatedly.

360
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:45,125
I know you will obey,
because you've already figured out

361
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:48,075
that this pope isn't afraid
to lose the faithful

362
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:50,900
if they're been
even slightly unfaithful,

363
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,425
and that means
this Pope does not negotiate.

364
00:45:53,475 --> 00:45:56,800
On anything or with anyone.

365
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:59,825
And this Pope
cannot be blackmailed!

366
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:08,200
From this day forth,
the word "compromise",

367
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:12,575
has been banished
from the vocabulary.

368
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:14,325
I've just deleted it.

369
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:19,825
When Jesus willingly
mounted the cross,

370
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:22,325
he was not making compromises.

371
00:46:25,925 --> 00:46:27,625
And neither am I.

372
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,125
Amen.

373
00:49:19,025 --> 00:49:20,475
Jump.

374
00:49:29,475 --> 00:49:31,400
Holy Father,

375
00:49:32,325 --> 00:49:37,400
I have to confess
a horrible thing I did.

376
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:42,725
Confess your secrets to God alone,
Esther.

377
00:49:44,325 --> 00:49:46,850
Even those that have to do with me.

378
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,950
There's only one thing I can do
for you: forgive you.

379
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,725
Forgive you always.

380
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:28,125
Holy Father,

381
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:31,750
I feel it.

382
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,200
Yes,

383
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,850
-  I feel it.
- Yes.

384
00:50:40,075 --> 00:50:42,075
You're right. I feel it too.

385
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,650
Bye, Zizi', thanks!

386
00:52:22,275 --> 00:52:23,900
Gentlemen...

387
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,975
what an honor!

388
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:31,025
To what do I owe...

389
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:34,100
the reason...

390
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:37,450
for this visit?

391
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,725
Tonino Pettola,

392
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:45,900
the reason for this visit...

393
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:49,425
is that you...
have busted our balls!
