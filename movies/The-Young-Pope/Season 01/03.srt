1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,450
All of us cardinals were there,
at the Conclave.

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,450
We were on the fourth ballot,
the famous total stalemate.

4
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:26,025
I looked at Cardinal Dussolier,

5
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:27,900
a longshot for the Papacy,

6
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,575
we've known each other
since we were kids,

7
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:33,650
We've shared
every suffering imaginable.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:39,200
I looked at tall, stoop-shouldered
Cardinal Spencer, my mentor,

9
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:44,625
the most eligible of all
the candidates, looking so wise.

10
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,250
I've always been suspicious
of wisdom.

11
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:54,200
I'm convinced he was already
drafting his first papal address

12
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,825
in his head, maybe even
composing his first encyclical.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,750
I looked and looked at them.

14
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,850
And then I prayed to God.

15
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,475
You did well to pray.

16
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:14,275
At any rate, it is the Holy Spirit
who must illumine...

17
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:17,025
This was the prayer
I muttered between my teeth:

18
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:22,000
Lord, I don't care with what means,
licit or illicit,

19
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,525
they're all fine, I don't care
about the Holy Spirit,

20
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:29,100
whether He illumines me or not,

21
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,100
I don't care about anything, I
don't care about your opinions,

22
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,900
or if I'm up to the task,

23
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,975
or if I'm not an outsider
or a longshot,

24
00:01:37,025 --> 00:01:38,525
I don't care if you think I'm weak,

25
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:44,450
or a scoundrel, I don't care
about loving my neighbor as myself,

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,775
I will never love
my neighbor as myself,

27
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:49,450
I only care about one thing, Lord,

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,025
that I, not the others,
can be useful to You.

29
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:00,900
I prayed some more,
harder this time.

30
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,350
I was praying so hard
I nearly shit my pants.

31
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,025
I had to glue my ass to my chair
so as not to make a mess,

32
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:10,125
I stared,
straight to Dussolier and I said:

33
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:13,725
God, not him, me.

34
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:17,250
I looked at Spencer and I said:
God, not him, me.

35
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,150
I must have chanted
those words a thousand times

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
before they opened the voting again,

37
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,275
like a mantra: not him,
me, not him, me,

38
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:29,475
not him, me, not him, me.

39
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:33,025
And then, toward the end:
not them, me.

40
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,950
And now I'm the Pope.

41
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,875
Not them.

42
00:02:42,775 --> 00:02:44,250
Me.

43
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,900
Sister Mary would call it a miracle.

44
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,100
Others would call it
the answer to a prayer.

45
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,275
But I don't know what to call it.

46
00:02:57,025 --> 00:03:00,475
They all went white when
they heard the name I'd chosen,

47
00:03:00,525 --> 00:03:03,150
and I reveled in their fear.

48
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,525
They were beginning to realize
who I am,

49
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:11,150
because that is the enormous
error they committed:

50
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,025
they chose a pope they didn't know.

51
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:18,900
And today they began to understand.

52
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,275
That is their tremendous sin:

53
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,500
they chose a Pope
they presumed they knew.

54
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,850
I spoke my new name, Pius XIII,

55
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,950
and they forgot
to thank God because they thought

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,600
that God had failed
to illumine them.

57
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,575
I forgot to thank God,
because I didn't think

58
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,900
God had illumined them either.

59
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,450
I love myself more than
my neighbor, more than God,

60
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,100
I believe only in myself,
I am the lord omnipotent:

61
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,125
Lenny, you have illumined yourself!
Fuck!

62
00:05:22,275 --> 00:05:24,400
We had a deal, Angelo!

63
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,650
Me pope, you reconfirmed
the Secretary of State.

64
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,100
The perfect balance.

65
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,200
But then you broke our agreement.

66
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,725
You pulled that kid out of the hat.

67
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:35,450
My own student.

68
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,575
You really are a shit!

69
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,975
You won't be able to manage him,
you know.

70
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:43,750
You must have learned that by now,
after that homily he gave.

71
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,025
How stupid can you be!

72
00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:48,975
You were so fearful of my extremis,

73
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:52,450
that you forgot
the most obvious truth:

74
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,050
the young are always
more extreme than the old.

75
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,950
But there is another truth, Michael.

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,100
What other truth?

77
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,825
That you were afraid old Spencer
would be beyond your control?

78
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:07,075
Well, now you got yourself
a young Spencer.

79
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:10,200
The Church is gonna be in his
clutches for a long time.

80
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,275
And it's not even a given that
you'll be reconfirmed.

81
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,400
I don't understand, what are you
getting out of all this?

82
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,850
You don't understand
because you don't allow me

83
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,200
to tell you the truth.

84
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,525
- And what truth would that be?
- I didn't plot against you.

85
00:06:27,575 --> 00:06:30,950
I didn't direct
my men to vote for Belardo.

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,725
Sure, I let people believe
that was the case,

87
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:36,725
so as to maintain my power.

88
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:39,200
But that's not how it went.

89
00:06:39,825 --> 00:06:45,300
At a certain point, without
anyone giving instructions,

90
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,075
Belardo started winning votes.

91
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,400
That is the unspeakable truth,
Michael.

92
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,450
Don't fuck with me, Angelo!

93
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,450
What do you expect me to believe?

94
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,650
That what we witnessed in there...

95
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,900
...was the breath
of the Holy Spirit.

96
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,850
I think so, Michael, I really do.

97
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,850
I believe the Holy Spirit breathed.

98
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,150
You're out of your mind.

99
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,900
Michael, the Holy Spirit breathed.

100
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:22,225
Forgive me, Lord,
for I have been unforgiveable.

101
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,350
It's not true that I illumine
myself. You illumine me.

102
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
It's not true that
I feel omnipotent.

103
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,575
You are the Lord Omnipotent.

104
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,025
It's not true that
I don't care about anything.

105
00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:33,950
The only thing I care about is You.

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,775
You alone.

107
00:07:35,825 --> 00:07:38,975
And if I've forgotten to thank You,
I thank You now.

108
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:42,900
And if I've sinned by presumption,
I ask Your forgiveness now.

109
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,950
And if I've tricked that poor Don Tommaso,
I ask Your forgiveness now.

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,475
And if I have frightened people,
I ask Your forgiveness now.

111
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:53,225
And if I have wished Spencer
and Dussolier harm,

112
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:55,475
I ask You send harm my way as well.

113
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:59,400
And if I have abused my power,
I ask You to take it from me now.

114
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,775
Forgive me, Lord, illumine me.

115
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:04,650
Give me the words to say
to the cardinals.

116
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,400
My address regards You.

117
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,575
My words are Your words.

118
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,725
I keep praying for You to make
something happen,

119
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:16,450
so why this awful, crawling
feeling that nothing ever does?

120
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,275
I know, dictate to me Lord.

121
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,450
Yes, dictate to me.

122
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,025
I've always been good
at taking notes, You know that.

123
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:30,325
You know that.

124
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:08,650
Your Excellency, can I race my
toy cars on the carpet?

125
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,575
"Excellency" you can say
to your mom!

126
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,575
You have to call me: Eminence.

127
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,450
Eminence, so can I...

128
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,200
Do you know
how much that carpet costs?

129
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,800
Twice the GDP
of your entire Country.

130
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,350
Cane sugar for me, please.

131
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,450
You have to buy your
own cane sugar, Aguirre,

132
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,950
because frankly
the stuff makes me want to puke.

133
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,350
It's been four hundred years

134
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,275
since a Pope took such a hostile
stance toward the faithful.

135
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,825
In any case, I have to talk
with the Pope soon.

136
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:43,775
I'll make a point of divining
his intentions.

137
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:46,575
"Divining his intentions?"

138
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:52,725
Voiello, you'd said: I report
to you, the Pope reports to me.

139
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:55,875
His speech was just one false step.

140
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,000
We have a young Pope.

141
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,950
Have you been reading the paper?!

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,650
They're all asking, "what is the
Cardinal Secretary of State doing?"

143
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:17,075
I know what to do.

144
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,525
What we need...

145
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:27,300
is a dramatic gesture..

146
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,025
Voiello, you need to hand in
your resignation today.

147
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,325
Excellent!

148
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,700
That's what you'll do, Voiello.

149
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:50,250
It's a genuine miracle that
this assembly generated an idea.

150
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,650
A first-rate idea.

151
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:13,950
I'm willing to bet, that
in the aftermath of my homily,

152
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,725
you're ready to hand
in your resignation.

153
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:18,775
I wouldn't even think
of it, Holy Father.

154
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:21,850
Were you hurt not to hear
the homily you drafted for me?

155
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,925
Frustration is an emotion that
does not appertain

156
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,150
to the Secretary of State.

157
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,700
- Did you like my homily?
- That's not the point.

158
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,775
Then let's hear the point.

159
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:31,600
The point is that the faithful were,

160
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,575
to put it euphemistically,
surprised.

161
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,375
More than surprised,
they were overwhelmed.

162
00:11:38,425 --> 00:11:40,850
God overwhelms.

163
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,550
God frightens.

164
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Priorities?

165
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,275
Your speech
to our brother cardinals.

166
00:11:46,325 --> 00:11:48,375
In due time. Anything else?

167
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:50,750
The Kurtwell case, Holy Father.

168
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:53,350
The big hot potato.

169
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,575
Exactly, Holy Father.

170
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,825
Your predecessor didn't
have time to put someone

171
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,350
in charge of this delicate matter.

172
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,725
But I will. In due time.

173
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:05,225
With all due respect, Holy Father,
the time is "now".

174
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:08,600
The charges of the child-abuse
are detailed and embarrassing

175
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,925
and Kurtwell's attitude is, to say
the least, defiant and insolent.

176
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:14,175
Anything else?

177
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:18,950
Holy Father, it's my duty to inform
you that the press and the TV news,

178
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,225
after attacking us
over your inaugural speech,

179
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:25,650
have now begun a new phase
in which they ask us to clarify

180
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,225
the meaning of your statements.

181
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:32,400
Typical plebeian reaction:
to hate when you do not understand.

182
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,275
How are we going to put over
the idea that the world press corps

183
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:40,200
has difficulty understanding
the basic concepts?

184
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:47,725
A potential compromise might be
to call a press conference

185
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:51,075
- to explain things.
- I don't appear, I don't explain.

186
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,275
Not you, Holy Father.

187
00:12:52,325 --> 00:12:54,525
I could go myself
to give an interview.

188
00:12:54,575 --> 00:12:57,525
We no longer give interviews,
Your Eminence.

189
00:12:57,575 --> 00:13:00,350
The only interviews
we give are to God.

190
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,300
Too bad he hasn't requested one
yet, it would be quite the scoop.

191
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,525
Holy Father, the press
is begging for a photo of you.

192
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:12,025
No.

193
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,100
Holy Father, it's Cardinal Ozolins.

194
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,625
Let him in. I've been expecting him.

195
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,475
You wished to see me, Your Holiness?

196
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:25,350
Yes, and for the last time, Ozolins.

197
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,750
Come with me.

198
00:13:38,075 --> 00:13:39,575
Now...

199
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:50,825
close your eyes
and choose your new destination.

200
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:53,975
What have I done wrong, Holy Father?

201
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:55,325
Nothing.

202
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,350
It's just that your role under
the previous three Popes

203
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,775
was to organize their travels.

204
00:13:58,825 --> 00:14:01,475
A role which I intend
to radically rescale,

205
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:05,275
because this Pope won't be
wasting time roaming the world.

206
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:09,775
As a result, I no longer need you.

207
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:11,775
It would be beneath
your stature as a cardinal

208
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:14,225
to accept a diminished role so...

209
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,725
Then why do I get the impression

210
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:20,975
that you're out
to diminish me even further?

211
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:22,700
Because it's true!

212
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,825
Now close your eyes
and plant a finger on the globe.

213
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,775
Close your eyes.

214
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,350
Ketchikan, Alaska!

215
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,850
Actually, Holy Father,
San Francisco is what turned up.

216
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,475
You're not right there, Ozolins.

217
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:42,525
Ketchikan, Alaska.

218
00:14:42,575 --> 00:14:43,950
It's a lovely place,
I've been there..

219
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,825
A nice little town,
population 8,000.

220
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,525
You'll like it.

221
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,450
Is it cold there?

222
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,200
Yeah, it's freezing.

223
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,500
But don't forget Nobel laureate
Joseph Brodsky's wonderful words:

224
00:14:57,275 --> 00:15:01,125
"Beauty at low temperatures
is beauty".

225
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:18,075
Holy Father, a little gift for you.

226
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,950
Blessed Father,
this is a very useful object,

227
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,875
but only if you open it.

228
00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:52,400
You see?

229
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:56,325
It can be perfectly useful
even when it's closed.

230
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,275
Your Holiness, will you allow me,

231
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:03,575
given my venerable age,
a vaguely critical observation?

232
00:16:05,075 --> 00:16:06,950
Yes, I allow you.

233
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,900
To expect a devoted and adoring
crowd to ponder the enigma

234
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:16,100
of God's existence amounts
to asking an obsolete question.

235
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:20,700
The question now is
not whether God exists,

236
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,650
but rather, why do we depend on God?

237
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,100
You surprised me, Holy Father.

238
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,800
You're so young...

239
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:37,850
and yet you have such old ideas.

240
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,450
You're wrong about that.
I'm an orphan.

241
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:42,900
And orphans are never young.

242
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,525
But the majority
of the churchgoers are not orphans.

243
00:16:46,575 --> 00:16:48,450
Says who?

244
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,200
Do you really think the only orphans

245
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,400
are those
without a mother and father?

246
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,775
Even if it were true,

247
00:16:54,825 --> 00:17:00,400
as an orphan grows older, he may
discover a fresh youth within.

248
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,700
We're gonna hold a press conference.

249
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,000
Voiello will be happy
to face the press.

250
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,100
Voiello won't be facing the press,
you will.

251
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,325
Me? I'm not up to the challenge.

252
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,950
I wouldn't know how to respond.

253
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,225
You won't be expected to respond.
You'll be expected to affirm.

254
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:40,875
Affirm what I am going
to dictate to you.

255
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,975
You look on edge to me.

256
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:58,575
You always ask rhetorical questions.

257
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,350
Why don't you just tell me
why I'm on edge?

258
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,200
You're upset because
of the press conference.

259
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,200
You've never held one.

260
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,850
Exactly.

261
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,325
And you're depressed
because you wanted to do it.

262
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:15,200
True, but not because I want
to be in the spotlight.

263
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:19,925
I would have been happy for
a chance to publicly reassure

264
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:23,400
the bishops, who've been calling me
from all over the world,

265
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,775
in a general state of alarm.

266
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:29,600
Can I ask what your general stance
will be at the press conference?

267
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,575
No, you cannot.

268
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,900
Tell the truth, you would have
preferred Spencer as pope.

269
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:41,150
Spencer has always been smarter
than the rest of us,

270
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,400
but also more fragile.

271
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,575
That's why I worked
against his election.

272
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,175
Have you ever considered becoming
the pope yourself?

273
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:51,600
No.

274
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,950
A pope needs to inspire trust.

275
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,575
I inspire the opposite.

276
00:18:55,625 --> 00:19:00,950
But the question that distresses me
is: what inspires Pope Pius XIII?

277
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:06,275
Everyone wants to see him,
and he refuses to be seen.

278
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:08,225
The faithful expect reassurance,

279
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:12,200
and instead he offers
only unsettling comments.

280
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,575
I can't figure out
what he has in mind.

281
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,100
What kind of Church
is he looking for?

282
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,650
You tell me, does he have a plan?

283
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,075
I really have to tell you,
Sister Mary:

284
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,925
this Pope is strange
and contradictory.

285
00:19:26,975 --> 00:19:28,250
Just like you.

286
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,150
- Just like me?
- Just like you!

287
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,475
What can you say about a man who

288
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:39,950
lives in an 6,500-square-foot
apartment with a private sauna...

289
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,775
and a billiard table, surrounded
by fine tapestries,

290
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:48,225
goldsmithery, damasks,
and expensive artworks,

291
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:51,150
but who also takes the time,

292
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,500
and energy at night
to babysit a disabled boy.

293
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,250
You're unbeatable, Sister Mary.

294
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,275
No one's unbeatable, Your Eminence.

295
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,200
It's a matter of patience,
which means it's a matter of time.

296
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:14,750
And that's what I ask of you:
time and patience.

297
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:17,925
And you're not worried?

298
00:20:17,975 --> 00:20:20,175
No, I'm not.

299
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,325
Michael, I'm worried.

300
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:31,350
Lenny has barely begun and already
they're abandoning him in droves.

301
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,100
They should have thought about
it before, during the Conclave.

302
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,400
Well now you need
to give it some thought.

303
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,450
I've done everything
that's within my power to do.

304
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,575
- It's up to you!
- What are you raving about?

305
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,825
Lenny needs concepts and visions.

306
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:50,400
I can't help with that, but you can.

307
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,525
You are his spiritual father.

308
00:20:52,575 --> 00:20:55,200
I'm just a tired old man.

309
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,950
And history has passed me by.

310
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,050
You're just a man who's pissed off

311
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,600
because you didn't get
what you wanted most.

312
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,950
And now you're being spiteful.

313
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:08,525
A man of your prominence,
wallowing in such childishness:

314
00:21:08,575 --> 00:21:10,825
aren't you ashamed of yourself,
Michael?

315
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:14,900
- The boy has become a man.
- He's the father now.

316
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,850
And I must obey him.

317
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,025
Those are the rules.

318
00:21:19,075 --> 00:21:21,800
You're just spouting bullshit
and you know it.

319
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,975
He needs you
and you refuse to help him

320
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:27,325
in the name
of your bottomless vanity.

321
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:31,100
You will answer for this, before
God and in your ravaged conscience.

322
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,950
Lenny doesn't want my help.

323
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,225
He just wants me
to approve of his mistakes.

324
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:39,600
That's what every son
wants from their fathers.

325
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,900
So summon him
and withhold your approval.

326
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:46,450
That's what all good fathers
do with their sons.

327
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,000
The Pope has dictated
the following statement:

328
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:51,475
"I, Pius XIII, Bishop of Rome,
Vicar of Jesus Christ,

329
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:54,100
Successor of the Prince
of the Apostles,

330
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,400
Supreme Pontiff
of the Universal Church,

331
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:59,600
Primate of Italy,
Archbishop and Metropolitan

332
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,100
of the Province of Rome,

333
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,400
Sovereign of the State
of Vatican City,

334
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,525
and Servant of the Servants of God,

335
00:23:05,575 --> 00:23:07,950
wish to inform you
of my total indifference

336
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,725
to your doubts and criticism,

337
00:23:09,775 --> 00:23:12,450
in light of which
I deem it necessary

338
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,775
to reiterate my infallibility

339
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:16,900
in contrast to your
human fallibility."

340
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,750
Is this Pope claiming divine status?

341
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,975
"And by virtue of the prerogative,

342
00:23:25,025 --> 00:23:29,825
which is dogmatically sanctioned by
the supremacy of the Roman Pontiff,

343
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,325
I will not tolerate any delays

344
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:36,350
or compromises
as I carry out my plan."

345
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,475
What plan?

346
00:23:38,525 --> 00:23:41,325
We didn't understand
anything about the plan.

347
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:44,150
And once more
we don't understand who you are?

348
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,725
Me?

349
00:23:45,775 --> 00:23:47,450
I'm Sister Mary.

350
00:23:49,275 --> 00:23:51,825
Who is Sister Mary?

351
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:39,350
Holy Father, Cardinal Spencer
would be pleased to have you

352
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,150
call on him this evening,
if you wouldn't mind.

353
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,250
What unforgivable weakness!

354
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,725
There was no need to drag out
a bunch of old absurdities

355
00:25:02,775 --> 00:25:05,400
from the past.

356
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,575
All you had to do
was smile and greet the crowd.

357
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:13,750
I don't smile and I don't greet.

358
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,825
Did all those years
you spend studying with me

359
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:20,450
do you no good at all?

360
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,475
Yes, they taught
me to think for myself.

361
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:28,250
And this is what you
thought all by yourself?

362
00:25:30,325 --> 00:25:34,850
To set every Christian and
journalist in the world against you

363
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,450
in the first week of your Papacy?

364
00:25:39,275 --> 00:25:41,575
This is part of my plan too.

365
00:25:45,075 --> 00:25:46,450
What plan?

366
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,875
What plan?

367
00:25:57,575 --> 00:26:00,700
Absence is presence.

368
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:07,150
These are the fundamentals
of mystery.

369
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,475
The mystery that will be
at the center of my Church.

370
00:26:12,525 --> 00:26:16,325
Mystery is a serious matter,

371
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:18,775
it's not some marketing strategy.

372
00:26:18,825 --> 00:26:21,450
Out there,

373
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,650
everyone must learn
that it takes sacrifice

374
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,450
and suffering to find God.

375
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:32,275
It's too easy to come to terms
with God as the sun is setting.

376
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,325
They have to find Him in the cold
and the dark of night.

377
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
The way I did.

378
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,450
"Absence is presence."

379
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,025
"Sacrifice and suffering."

380
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:49,200
I know where these ideas
are coming from

381
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,950
because I know you even better
than you know yourself.

382
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,075
- Where are they coming from?
- From your own life.

383
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:59,225
Your parents rejected you,
so you've spent your entire life

384
00:26:59,275 --> 00:27:01,475
trying to receive
them within yourself.

385
00:27:01,525 --> 00:27:04,525
They distanced themselves from you,
so you desire them.

386
00:27:04,575 --> 00:27:07,700
And then you,
in your unmedicated concide,

387
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,450
you presumed that your needs
are the same as those

388
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,325
of a billion of the Catholics!

389
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:15,100
Cut out this dime-store
psychoanalysis and work with me.

390
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,950
I don't work
with nine-year-old boys.

391
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,825
You've never budged from the front
gate of that orphanage

392
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,600
where one fine day,

393
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:29,400
without explanations,
your parents abandoned you.

394
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,400
Cut it out.

395
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,150
May God help us!

396
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,000
You want to make the world
pay for the wrong it did you.

397
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:40,825
You'll be a terrible Pope,

398
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:45,225
the worst and the most dangerous
in modern times,

399
00:27:45,275 --> 00:27:49,225
and I don't intend to waste
the few years I have remaining

400
00:27:49,275 --> 00:27:52,775
being an accomplice
to a vindictive little boy.

401
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,500
You are drunk.

402
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,375
No. Not enough.

403
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,900
I know that woman.

404
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:26,300
That's Esther, the wife of Peter.

405
00:29:27,675 --> 00:29:29,125
A Swiss Guard.

406
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,950
Do you still think about me
now and then?

407
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:48,300
I'm begging you, I need to know:

408
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,450
do you still think about me
now and then?

409
00:29:56,625 --> 00:30:00,050
Let go of me, someone might see us.

410
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,250
So, why did you come get me?

411
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:15,500
The Holy Father wishes to see you.

412
00:30:40,925 --> 00:30:43,775
Haven't you ever been
in the Apostolic Palace before?

413
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:47,425
Never, in all these years.

414
00:30:48,675 --> 00:30:51,350
Well, what do you think?

415
00:30:53,425 --> 00:30:54,775
It makes you feel uneasy.

416
00:30:54,825 --> 00:30:59,325
It was designed
and built with that exact intent.

417
00:31:38,575 --> 00:31:40,650
You wanted to meet me?

418
00:31:43,675 --> 00:31:46,875
Was that clear even from up here?

419
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:52,050
Why were you standing motionless
in the middle of the square?

420
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,250
I wanted you to know.

421
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:57,700
Know what?

422
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,700
That I loved your homily.

423
00:32:05,575 --> 00:32:09,950
That's not enough!

424
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:15,875
Because it's not enough
to just love it,

425
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:19,000
you also need to perceive it.

426
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:22,300
I think I perceived it.

427
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,750
And what else did you perceived?

428
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,450
What?

429
00:32:43,825 --> 00:32:45,625
Respect.

430
00:33:58,575 --> 00:34:00,225
What's your name?

431
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,150
All right, let's get started.

432
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,250
Holy Father, I am sure that
there is no need to remind you

433
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,575
that the cardinals are expecting
your speech of thanks

434
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:31,275
and to be sent home.

435
00:34:31,325 --> 00:34:33,775
You're right, there is no need to
remind me, but you did it anyway.

436
00:34:33,825 --> 00:34:36,275
What about the papal tiara
from Washington?

437
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:38,450
Apparently it's on its way.

438
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,575
Now: the Kurtwell case.

439
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:44,850
I have a candidate: a layman,
Fabio Claudio Tavarelli.

440
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,875
Highly impartial.

441
00:34:46,925 --> 00:34:48,825
An impartial layman?

442
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:51,025
Yes, that's Tavarelli.

443
00:34:51,075 --> 00:34:53,150
Your Eminence,
you seem a bit impetuous

444
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,600
when it comes to the Kurtwell case.

445
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,500
I'm not impetuous. I'm fair.

446
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:00,150
Among the many things that are
fair, let's also remember

447
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,150
that the American seminaries run
by Kurtwell provide forty percent

448
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,650
of all new priests in North America.

449
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,900
Sister Mary, if the intention
is to cover up the Kurtwell case...

450
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:15,200
No one wants to cover anything up,
Your Eminence.

451
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,775
But I've already told you that I
will oversee the Kurtwell case,

452
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,200
and that I will appoint
someone I trust.

453
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,450
When, Holy Father?

454
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,850
Later.

455
00:35:25,675 --> 00:35:27,925
When the Holy Spirit illumines me.

456
00:35:28,575 --> 00:35:32,950
Only the Holy Spirit hasn't
scheduled a meeting with me yet.

457
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:36,425
What else
do your agenda books tell us?

458
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:41,150
On Thursday, the Holy Father
is scheduled to baptize

459
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,350
ninety children
from all over Europe.

460
00:35:45,925 --> 00:35:48,275
Must I really subject myself
to such torture?

461
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:51,075
Holy Father, the church tends
to attach a fair amount

462
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:53,100
of importance to baptism.

463
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,550
Anything a little more stimulating?

464
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,750
In light of the statements made
at the press conference,

465
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,225
newspapers around the world have
just begun to unlease holy hell.

466
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:10,000
Well, that's always the first step
on the path to paradise.

467
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,875
I see.

468
00:36:11,925 --> 00:36:14,775
I'm not the one dispensing jokes
in the Vatican anymore,

469
00:36:14,825 --> 00:36:18,000
Your Holiness, now it's you.

470
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,300
Your Eminence, first of all:

471
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:24,125
I suggest you recover as soon
as possible your legendary,

472
00:36:24,175 --> 00:36:26,000
fake courtesy.

473
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:30,375
And secondly:
my jokes contain the truth.

474
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,750
You know something, Holy Father?

475
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:39,075
You are as handsome as Jesus,
but you are not actually Jesus.

476
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:45,550
I may actually be more handsome,
but keep that to yourself.

477
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,900
Cardinal Spencer, in a private
conversation between the two of us,

478
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,925
alluded to certain machinations

479
00:36:57,975 --> 00:37:00,925
that led to my being elected Pope.

480
00:37:00,975 --> 00:37:04,700
He was unwilling to acquaint me
with the details.

481
00:37:06,675 --> 00:37:09,575
I'm not going to insist
with Spencer,

482
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:12,150
but I am with you, Voiello.

483
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:19,550
So, tell me exactly the dynamics
that went on to see me elected.

484
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,275
Tell me right now, or what you've
seen so far will be nothing

485
00:37:26,325 --> 00:37:29,750
but a foretaste
of the macabre banquet

486
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,525
that will bring on
the ruin of the Church.

487
00:37:32,575 --> 00:37:34,325
Explain it all, right here,

488
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:39,300
right now, because even
a second later will be too late.

489
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,250
Are you telling me that
you're behaving irrationally

490
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,950
with the faithful, the Vatican
Curia, and the mass media because

491
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,450
you were kept out of the loop on
the behind-the-scenes machinations

492
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,925
that led to your election?

493
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,275
No.

494
00:37:58,325 --> 00:38:02,275
I am ordering you, beginning
with your next utterance,

495
00:38:02,325 --> 00:38:04,450
to tell me why I was elected,

496
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,625
and what my election
was supposed to mean to you all.

497
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,550
In truth, the Holy Spirit...

498
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:23,400
You were not supposed to be
the man of the Providence,

499
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,750
you were supposed
to be the Pope of compromise.

500
00:38:27,575 --> 00:38:29,075
What do you mean by compromise?

501
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:33,125
Your prudence as a cardinal was
interpreted as a potential bridge

502
00:38:33,175 --> 00:38:36,200
between the progressive positions
so dear to me

503
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,650
and the more conservative ones
so dear to Spencer.

504
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,000
You were considered
to be a synthesis.

505
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:46,200
A happy synthesis, pleasing both
to the Holy Spirit and myself,

506
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:50,150
the great elector who, believing
in you and your young talent,

507
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,875
influenced a majority of cardinals.

508
00:38:52,925 --> 00:38:55,250
Now, for reasons that
are unclear to me,

509
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,575
you no longer want to be a bridge.

510
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:01,700
And this is only the beginning.

511
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,775
Why are you doing this?

512
00:39:03,825 --> 00:39:07,500
- Why did you change?
- A Pope is not a cardinal.

513
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:13,075
A cardinal works
in a collegial manner,

514
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:17,175
while a Pope
is an absolute sovereign.

515
00:39:17,225 --> 00:39:20,150
Fuck, you were supposed
to share your sovereignty

516
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,625
with my advice and Spencer's!

517
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:24,500
Not like this!

518
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,075
A decidedly undiplomatic response,
Your Eminence.

519
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:45,050
You're right, Holy Father, and
I humbly beg your forgiveness.

520
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,700
I'm not sure that's enough.

521
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,000
Do you want my resignation?

522
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,500
I'm not sure that's enough.

523
00:40:06,325 --> 00:40:08,000
Tell Valente to go to the archives

524
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:11,500
and bring the procedure
for deposing a cardinal.

525
00:40:13,075 --> 00:40:16,675
May I ask you both
to leave us for a moment?

526
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:26,950
Your Eminence,

527
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,075
would you have me believe
that I am Pope thanks to you.

528
00:40:34,325 --> 00:40:39,050
But you and I both know
that's not the truth.

529
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:05,625
But if the Pope thinks he
can depose the Secretary of State

530
00:41:05,675 --> 00:41:09,975
without all the grave repercussions
that are bound to ensue,

531
00:41:10,025 --> 00:41:12,075
then it means that he
really understands nothing

532
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:15,225
about the way things work here.

533
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:21,775
You have no idea
of how vast my powers are,

534
00:41:21,825 --> 00:41:25,500
here and beyond
the walls of Vatican City.

535
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,950
You braved this terrible
storm out of fear

536
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,375
you might lose your cardinalate?

537
00:41:40,425 --> 00:41:43,800
Out of fear I might lose the Church.

538
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:45,300
Go away.

539
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,275
I don't wanna talk to you anymore.

540
00:41:48,325 --> 00:41:51,000
You're a traitor and a fool.

541
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,875
And I don't know which one is worse.

542
00:41:54,925 --> 00:41:56,575
Wait.

543
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:59,000
I didn't come alone.

544
00:42:33,225 --> 00:42:34,825
What's he doing?

545
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,550
He's lifting the weight of God.

546
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:45,750
And what is the weight of God like,
Michael?

547
00:42:46,425 --> 00:42:47,925
Very fragile.

548
00:42:48,825 --> 00:42:51,125
It's extremely fragile.

549
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:59,625
Which is why you are going to help
us to fortify God.

550
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,200
I tried.

551
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,400
It's hopeless.

552
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:09,825
No, Michael.

553
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:12,175
We have to spend...

554
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:15,900
our whole lives trying.

555
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:23,225
We have to try right
till the moment of our death.

556
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:29,250
That's what priests do.

557
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:35,925
We give God's...

558
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:40,450
...weight!

559
00:43:59,925 --> 00:44:01,950
I beg your forgiveness, Lenny.

560
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,500
Forgive me.

561
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:09,275
I've come to tell you
that I've changed my mind.

562
00:44:09,325 --> 00:44:11,325
I'll gladly accept
the position of Prefect

563
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:13,550
for the Congregation for the Clergy.

564
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,200
I'm sorry, Michael, it's too late.

565
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:21,425
There is no position left open
for you.

566
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:27,925
One more thing, Cardinal Spencer.

567
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,850
What?

568
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:34,575
Address me as Your Holiness.

569
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:41,450
Blessed Father,
I am the bishop of Belluno,

570
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,525
but I speak for all
the other bishops of Italy

571
00:44:44,575 --> 00:44:47,450
and nearly all the parish priests.

572
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:53,375
It behooves me to inform you that
something anomalous is happening.

573
00:44:54,075 --> 00:44:58,275
Your words to the faithful have sown

574
00:44:58,325 --> 00:45:03,575
doubt and, worse, fear.

575
00:45:05,575 --> 00:45:08,525
Many of them are afraid...

576
00:45:08,575 --> 00:45:13,325
to set foot inside
their parish church again,

577
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:16,950
they come to us,
eager for an explanation.

578
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,825
In other words, they're scared.

579
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:27,000
What truly made our church great?

580
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:30,000
Fear or tolerance?

581
00:45:30,925 --> 00:45:34,325
What can we learn
from the history of our Church?

582
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:37,900
How great was the papal state
when fear among nations

583
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:40,400
was part of our DNA?

584
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:42,450
How small did we become,

585
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:47,325
how greatly did our influence
decline, when we decided to yield.

586
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:53,325
To succumb, to withdraw, to become
accommodating and reassuring?

587
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:00,250
This place, these people,

588
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,625
placate my sense of disquiet,

589
00:46:04,825 --> 00:46:07,325
all my anxieties,

590
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:09,825
both ancient and modern.

591
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,650
It's nice and cold, Holy Father.

592
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,925
I don't doubt it, Sister.

593
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,500
Would you be so kind as to bring me
three oranges, as well?

594
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:26,075
Certainly, Holy Father.

595
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:48,325
I so wish that I could
have been thunderstruck,

596
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:53,625
as you were, one May afternoon,

597
00:46:53,675 --> 00:46:55,275
in the heart of the Church.

598
00:46:56,575 --> 00:46:58,000
Instead...

599
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:03,375
I became a priest for lack
of a better alternative.

600
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:10,500
From the orphanage with Sister Mary
I went straight to the seminary

601
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:14,175
under the protection
of Monsignor Spencer.

602
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:17,375
Then he became Cardinal Spencer.

603
00:47:18,675 --> 00:47:22,650
But between the end of school

604
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,625
and the beginning of seminary

605
00:47:26,575 --> 00:47:29,300
I had a week of vacation.

606
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:39,175
It was the first time I'd ever been
out in the world on my own.

607
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,250
I went to California,
and there I went to the beach.

608
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:49,550
And on that beach...

609
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,875
I won over a homely girl

610
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:04,825
who seemed at the time to be the
most beautiful girl in the world.

611
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,675
How did you win her over?

612
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:13,875
Please, tell me.

613
00:48:15,075 --> 00:48:17,375
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, Holy Father.

614
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,325
Like this.

615
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,125
We were together for a week.

616
00:48:34,175 --> 00:48:37,375
And then, I entered the seminary.

617
00:48:41,675 --> 00:48:45,075
This is the first time I've told
anyone about it.

618
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:09,650
Your Eminence, what,
what are you doing in my room?

619
00:49:11,825 --> 00:49:14,900
My dear Gutierrez,

620
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:17,150
have you ever asked yourself

621
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,825
how I've managed to run the
papal State for all these years?

622
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:24,325
Many times.

623
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:26,575
What 's your answer?

624
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,900
It requires a great
overarching vision, I imagine.

625
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:36,150
Precisely the opposite.

626
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,500
No vision whatsoever,

627
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:43,000
but by placing importance
on the irrelevant things.

628
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,875
And do you know how I manage to
learn all the irrelevant things

629
00:49:46,925 --> 00:49:49,750
that no one wants to tell me?

630
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:53,400
No... how?

631
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:56,325
By learning people's secrets

632
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,050
and threatening to reveal
those secrets to the Pope.

633
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:16,550
One bottle of gin doesn't make
an alcoholic of me.

634
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:18,625
Agreed.

635
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:21,950
One bottle doesn't.

636
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:32,375
But a whole liquor store full does.

637
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,525
Who told you I'm an alcoholic?

638
00:50:35,575 --> 00:50:40,250
I forgot to confide in you another
stratagem for running the Church:

639
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,625
never reveal your sources.

640
00:50:42,675 --> 00:50:47,000
And if for some reason you have to,
make them up.

641
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:57,650
Now, my very dear Bernardo,

642
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:00,500
let's not waste any more time.

643
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:03,775
You tell me about the irrelevant
things that you and the Pope say

644
00:51:03,825 --> 00:51:08,950
to each other and I will never tell
anyone that I got them from you.

645
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,275
If on the other hand
you refuse to tell me,

646
00:51:12,325 --> 00:51:17,400
I will reveal your
serious problem to the Pope,

647
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:21,525
and I'll have you sent away
from the Vatican once and for all.

648
00:51:21,575 --> 00:51:25,275
And you, outside of these walls,

649
00:51:25,325 --> 00:51:30,175
will be a lost man,
because you are a fearful man.

650
00:51:32,575 --> 00:51:34,800
What do you want me to say?

651
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,950
We, we don't talk about
anything of significance, really.

652
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,300
Today, for instance, he told me...

653
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:48,400
with some nostalgia

654
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:51,800
about a girlfriend he had
when he was just a kid.

655
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:55,125
You see, things like that,

656
00:51:55,175 --> 00:51:57,450
that's the height
of what he confides in me.

657
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,550
Stupid, silly things.

658
00:52:01,375 --> 00:52:03,000
I knew it!

659
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,150
What did you know, Your Eminence?

660
00:52:11,175 --> 00:52:13,625
That the Church is female!

661
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,800
Holy Father...

662
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,475
I have to ask you a somewhat
unseemly question.

663
00:52:34,325 --> 00:52:38,550
There are no unseemly questions
between you and me, Monsignor.

664
00:52:39,925 --> 00:52:43,500
Because... because you and I
respect each other.

665
00:52:46,925 --> 00:52:49,950
What remained with you
from your experience

666
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,425
with the girl...

667
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,325
...in California?

668
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:04,250
The memory of her eyes.

669
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:10,125
At first, eyes full of love,

670
00:53:12,825 --> 00:53:16,000
then later eyes full
of disappointment.

671
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:21,150
And that was an important lesson.

672
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,525
I understood
that I want Catholics in love

673
00:53:25,575 --> 00:53:28,425
and I no longer want to see
disappointment in their eyes.

674
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:31,575
Never again.

675
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:36,300
Still, at the same time,

676
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:42,425
I occasionally find myself
unable to believe my own words.

677
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:49,075
I don't believe my thoughts,

678
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:51,425
I don't believe in my will,

679
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:55,800
I don't believe in my abilities.

680
00:53:57,425 --> 00:54:00,675
I'm speaking to you
from the heart, monsignor.

681
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,000
There are times...

682
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,550
there are certain times,

683
00:54:07,425 --> 00:54:09,800
or possibly always...

684
00:54:13,825 --> 00:54:18,025
In short, there are times
when I don't believe.

685
00:54:31,175 --> 00:54:33,950
There are times when I think it
might be better to leave it all

686
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,800
in Voiello's hands.

687
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:38,925
He knows how to do things.

688
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:43,325
He believes in what he says.

689
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:46,775
And he still believes in God.

690
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,825
No, Holy Father.

691
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:51,800
No.

692
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,825
Voiello is a politician.

693
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:00,550
You are the Pope.
