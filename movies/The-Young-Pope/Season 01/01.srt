1
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,600
Ciao, Rome!

2
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,350
Ciao, world!

3
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,300
Ciao!

4
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,450
What have we forgotten?

5
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,150
What have we forgotten?

6
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,400
We have forgotten you!

7
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,000
Let me be very clear:

8
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,750
I'm here for one,
very simple reason.

9
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,800
To not forget anyone.

10
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,950
God does not leave anyone behind.

11
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,950
That is what He told me
when I decided to serve Him.

12
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,750
And it is what I say to you now.

13
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,850
I serve God. I serve you!

14
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:28,100
We've forgotten
the women and children,

15
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:32,850
who will change this world
with their love and their kindness.

16
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:38,150
And with their marvelous,
divine disposition to play.

17
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,600
Play is the only authentic means
we have

18
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,150
to make us feel
in harmony with life.

19
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:55,800
And to be in harmony with God
we have to be in harmony with life.

20
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,800
We don't have a choice:

21
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,400
we must be in harmony with God.

22
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,350
And what else have we forgotten?

23
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,950
We have forgotten to masturbate,

24
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,150
to use contraceptives,

25
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,900
to get abortions,

26
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,100
to celebrate gay marriages,

27
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,100
to allow priests
to love each other,

28
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,500
and even to get married.

29
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:48,550
We've forgotten that we can decide
to die if you detest living,

30
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,750
we've forgotten
to have sexual relations

31
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,150
for purposes other than procreation
without feeling guilty!

32
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,850
To divorce, to let nuns say mass,

33
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,650
to make babies in all the ways
science has discovered

34
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,500
and will continue to discover.

35
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,700
In short, my dear, dear children,

36
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,550
not only have we forgotten to play,

37
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,150
we have forgotten to be happy.

38
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:32,650
And there is only one road
that leads to happiness.

39
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,450
And that road is called freedom.

40
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:47,100
Sancti Apostoli Petrus et Paulus,

41
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,900
de quorum potestate
et auctoritate confidimus...

42
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,850
What are you saying, Lenny?
What's all this nonsense?

43
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,450
You're not the Pope, Lenny!

44
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,000
I am the Pope.

45
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,250
I'm the Pope, and you, Lenny, are

46
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,450
no longer a member of the Church.

47
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,750
You are done with God, Lenny.

48
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,450
What you mean done?

49
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,250
I just barely got started with God.

50
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,000
Who are you, Lenny?

51
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,400
I am a contradiction.

52
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,000
Like God.
One in three and three in one.

53
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,700
Like Mary, virgin and mother.

54
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,000
Like man, good and evil.

55
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,250


56
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,100


57
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:01,100


58
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,150
I am the Pope.

59
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,750
I am the Pope.

60
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,750
Not knowing your tastes,
Your Holiness,

61
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,100
we took the liberty of preparing
a little of everything.

62
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,800
Didn't anyone tell you I don't eat
much? Hardly anything, in fact!

63
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,550
All I have in the morning
is a Cherry Coke Zero.

64
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,000
We will get some right away.

65
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,650
- What's your name?
- Domen, Your Holiness.

66
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,100
I am Your Holiness's maggiordomo.

67
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,650
- Do you know what Domen means?
- "One who belongs to God".

68
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,650
Precisely. So, by transitive
property,

69
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,400
you belong to me.

70
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,650
How did you sleep, Your Holiness?

71
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,700
I had an amusing dream

72
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,650
Cardinal Ozolins and Cardinal
Aguirre slapping each other,

73
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,050
and I said the most outrageous
things to the crowd

74
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,350
in Saint Peter's Square.

75
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,300
Well then, I'll wait here
for my Cherry Coke Zero.

76
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,250
In the meantime would Your Holiness
care for a regular Diet Coke?

77
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,100
Let's not utter heresies, Domen.

78
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,800
It's death
to settle for things in life.

79
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,550
Holy Father, while you wait,
may I present Sister Bice,

80
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,000
from Nepi,
in delightful province of Lazio.

81
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,900
She will be your personal cook.

82
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:58,100
Sister Bice also served three
pontiffs who came before you.

83
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,700
When she was young,
she was a missionary in India

84
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,600
and fortunately for us,
she speaks a good English.

85
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,500
Well, my sweet Holy Father,

86
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,250
now what is it you would like
to have for your lunch?

87
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,900
You just tell
your Bice what you want,

88
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,800
and I'll prepare it for you.

89
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,700
Matriciana, pasta e fagioli,
carbonara, lasagne..

90
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,000
Am I mistaken,
did she say "my sweet"?

91
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,100
Your Holiness, Sister Bice
is rather... quaint.

92
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,550
No, Domen, she is not quaint.

93
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,500
She's friendly.

94
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,500
Mother...

95
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,200
Let me explain something to you,
that you, in your long life,

96
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,550
have not yet had the occasion
to understand:

97
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,700
friendly relationships
are dangerous.

98
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,100
They lend themselves
to ambiguities,

99
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,850
misunderstandings, and conflicts,

100
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,850
and they always end badly.

101
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,600
Formal relationships,
on the other hand,

102
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,950
are as clear as spring water.

103
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Their rules are carved in stone.

104
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,400
There's no risk
of being misunderstood

105
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,600
and they last forever.

106
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,050
Now, you need to know

107
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,750
I do not
appreciate friendly relationships.

108
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,900
But I'm a great admirer
of formal ones.

109
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,400
Where there are formal
relationships there are rites

110
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:20,050
and where there are rites
the earth order reigns.

111
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,800
Your Holiness, His Eminence
the Cardinal Secretary of State

112
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,800
and the Prefects
of the Various Congregations

113
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,400
can't wait to make your
acquaintance and to welcome you.

114
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,650
Well, they're gonna have to.

115
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,800
Because first I have to drink
my Cherry Coke Zero.

116
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,000
May God, who has enlightened
every heart, help you

117
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,200
to know your sins
and trust His mercy.

118
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,800
Your sins, Voiello?

119
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,700
Tommasino,
don't waste my time.

120
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,000
My sins have to do with
high finance and diplomacy.

121
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,800
Even if I were to confess them,
you wouldn't understand a thing.

122
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,400
So confess those I can understand.

123
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,900
I've had impure thoughts.

124
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,200
About who?

125
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,600
- About the Venus of Willendorf.
- Who's she?

126
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,200
The Paleolithic statue the Pope
keeps in his library.

127
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,650
It's 25,000 years-old.

128
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,250
Impure and gerontophilic thoughts
about a statue...

129
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,700
What sort of penance
can I assign for that?

130
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,400
You're making things difficult
for me, Voiello!

131
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,100
You think about it and let me know.

132
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,200
I'm in a hurry.

133
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,200
Look, guys, the Holy Spirit
is blowing away.

134
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,900
Speaking of the Holy Spirit,
what do you think?

135
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,650
Did He illumine the cardinals?

136
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,100
The naivetÃ© of you Africans
is really touching.

137
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,200
Do you really believe that
the Holy Spirit elects the Pope?

138
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,200
We Africans, no, but we Catholics,
yes, that is what we believe.

139
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,700
Don't you, Ozolins?

140
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:09,400
Well the Holy Spirit is not stupid
but He is ironic and cunning.

141
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,550
- I don't understand.
- What he's trying to tell you

142
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,650
is that here in Vatican

143
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,500
the Holy Spirit is
just another name for Voiello.

144
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:22,750
Belardo is forty-seven years old.

145
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,950
That's young.

146
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,350
Which means we won't live
to see another pope. How sad!

147
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,500
Caltanissetta,
it's already a miracle

148
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,650
that you've lived long enough
to see this one.

149
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:42,200
I'm not so sure that Voiello has
shown good leadership this time.

150
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,350
I've never really trusted Voiello myself.

151
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,500
He's the devil incarnate.

152
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:52,700
Spencer would have been
the right choice.

153
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,800
Far too independent,

154
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,500
and that wouldn't have been
a good news for us cardinals.

155
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,650
True.

156
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,550
But all we have in exchange
is a telegenic puppet.

157
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,950
And that means that
he can be manipulated.

158
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,200
This is a masterpiece
of Voiello's diplomatic cunning,

159
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,700
the way he shepherded
the cardinals' votes to Belardo.

160
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,600
Now Belardo holds office,

161
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,700
but Voiello is pulling the strings.

162
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,500
And he'll run things
the way we tell him,

163
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:34,700
because once again
we saved his life.

164
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,500
I may be African,
and I may be naive,

165
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,400
but if you ask me

166
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,700
you're simplifying the future
to an unhealthy degree.

167
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,600
I'm in agreement
with our African colleague.

168
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,300
What do you mean by that?

169
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:55,000
That you've forgotten to ask
one fundamental question.

170
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,600
What's Spencer going to do now

171
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:07,000
that his beloved,
detested protÃ©gÃ©

172
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,850
has become pope?

173
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,750
"My God, my God,
why have you forsaken me?"

174
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,600
said Jesus
before he was about to die.

175
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,950
Which is what I say to you now,
before I begin to live.

176
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,200
God's infinite silence...

177
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,200
God's infinite silence...

178
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,800
God's infinite silence.

179
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,500
Your Holiness... your sins.

180
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,000
I don't have any sins to confess.

181
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,250
Are you serious?

182
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,000
My only sin,
and it's an enormous one,

183
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,750
is that my conscience
does not accuse me of anything.

184
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:04,800
Ego te absolvo peccatis tuis
in nomine Patris,

185
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,150
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.

186
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,750
If I always heard confessions
like yours, Your Holiness,

187
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,750
I'd be out of a job.

188
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,900
How many confessions do you hear
in the Vatican, Don Tommaso?

189
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,150
Me?

190
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:36,950
The entire Curia, a good number
of nuns and priests,

191
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,050
as well as several lay employees
who work in Vatican City.

192
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,650
How old are you?

193
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,000
Sixty-one.

194
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,400
And how's your eyesight?

195
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't even wear glasses.

196
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,300
And your hearing?

197
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,700
My only problem is my hair,
Your Holiness.

198
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,900
You mean it's falling out?

199
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,100
Not only that. Sometimes it hurts.

200
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,800
Your hair hurts?

201
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,150
Good, very good!

202
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,550
I'll be frank, Don Tommaso,
I need you.

203
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,400
You must do something
very important

204
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,500
for the eminency of your pontiff.

205
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,700
Whatever you wish, Holy Father.
Tell me.

206
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,350
Come then, I'll tell you
in the confessional.

207
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,100
Confessional booths
are so beautiful.

208
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,450
They look like
little mountain huts.

209
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,800
Do you like the mountains?

210
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,550
I don't like the snow.

211
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,450
Here's what I want you to do.

212
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,500
Behold the Naples trinity,
Federico.

213
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,700
Your Eminence.

214
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,750
Do you know how many books
have been written about me?

215
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,900
- Seventeen.
- Eighteen.

216
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,500
The last one's going to press
next week,

217
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,500
and it's got the best title of all.

218
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:51,100
- Which is?
- The Man Behind the Scenes.

219
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,500
- Beautiful. - Of course.
I suggested it myself.

220
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:58,500
- Who wrote it? - Manna,
that leftist reporter.

221
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,900
That means it'going to be critical
of you, Your Eminence.

222
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,500
Of course, those are the best.
They turn you into a legend.

223
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,600
Don't overdo it now, or people
will know you're faking it.

224
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,000
Forgive me, Eminence,
but that was a good one.

225
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,300
You should laugh,
but in proportion.

226
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,400
Valente,

227
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,050
-  His Holiness?
- He's at the Heliport.

228
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,150
He just got here, and he
already wants to leave?

229
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,750
Now you could have laughed
a little more.

230
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,550
He sent me to tell you he'll be
late for your meeting, Eminence.

231
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,100
Okay, but if you see him,
tell him not to be too late,

232
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,500
because I, unlike him,
have a lot to do.

233
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,800
I've got to steet this boat,

234
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,150
which that indecisive fisherman
Peter left me.

235
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,900
Valente, what do you make of him?

236
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:54,700
He's a man of little appetite.
Actually... very little.

237
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,750
This is not a good sign.
Not a good sign.

238
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,050
Ma'.

239
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,600
Don't ever call me Ma'.
Call me Sister Mary.

240
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,050
What's that?

241
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,750
My father gave it to me.

242
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,800
You can give it to me if you like.
I'll hold on to it for you.

243
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,850
No. My father said that I should
always keep it with me.

244
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,900
Lenny.

245
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,950
Sister Mary.

246
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,900
Here you are, my saint.

247
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,250
- No, I'm not a saint.
- Yes.

248
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,350
Do you still have it on you?

249
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,750
Always.

250
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,100
What's this?

251
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,750
A replica of the grotto
of Our Lady of Lourdes.

252
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,450
It's being restored.

253
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,000
From now on, you're going to be living
at the exact center of the Church.

254
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,850
But I don't understand.
What does that mean?

255
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,700
That means that just now

256
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,600
the center of the Church
took a few steps back.

257
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,000
Do you like the apartment?

258
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,700
I'll be just fine here.

259
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,400
You're only a few feet away
from me.

260
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,150
On the plane I read this
amusing description of Rome:

261
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,750
"A suburb of Vatican City."

262
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,800
Well, that's not exactly true,

263
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,750
but it will be.

264
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,050
What's wrong, Lenny?

265
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,150
What's not wrong, Sister Mary!

266
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,300
North is that way.

267
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,000
Where Venice is.

268
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,450
Listen to me, Lenny.

269
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:40,300
Starting today,
you have to lead the Church.

270
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,050
One billion people.

271
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,750
One fifth of the world's population.

272
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,450
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Lenny?

273
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:51,800
One billion people will depend
on what you say and do.

274
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:56,000
They'll make important decisions,
happy or sad,

275
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,450
of life or death,

276
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,800
in order
to obey you, in the name of God.

277
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,750
All of this creates
a new perspective.

278
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,250
An immense perspective.

279
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:15,100
Now, your personal aches,
your enormous sufferings,

280
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,000
your terrible memories...

281
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,500
It's a harsh thing to say, Lenny,
but I have to say it,

282
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:23,300
they must take a back seat.

283
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,100
They are things of this earth.

284
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:29,050
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Lenny?

285
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,000
I know all your sorrows,

286
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,800
I've lived with them
together with you,

287
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,100
I've wept over them with you,

288
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,150
but now the time has come for you

289
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,650
to let your sorrows to fade,

290
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,750
to become irrelevant,
distant memories,

291
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,200
insignificant, vanquished,
destroyed and overpowered

292
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,000
by the terrible responsibility
that God has given you.

293
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,550
From now on, you are no longer
Lenny Belardo,

294
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,150
the fatherless, motherless boy.

295
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,950
From now on,

296
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:08,450
you are Pope Pius XIII,

297
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:13,850
Father and Mother
of the entire Catholic Church.

298
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,500
Allow me to say,
Your Holiness, what joy!

299
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,500
What joy!

300
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:41,800
The Holy Spirit could not have
illumined us in a better manner.

301
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,200
In the name of the entire Church,
welcome.

302
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,250
May your pontificate be long,
radiant, and fruitful.

303
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,250
Let's settle for long.

304
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,600
What a telling joke!

305
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,150
Jokes are never telling.
They're jokes.

306
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,400
Well, Holy father,

307
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,700
first of all, a small piece of information

308
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,800
of a practical
and picturesque nature...

309
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:14,300
Under your desk, on the right,
you will find a button.

310
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,800
If you feel that an encounter
is becoming disagreeable

311
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,050
or a waste of time,

312
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,000
all you have
to do is to press it discreetly,

313
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:25,400
and an assistant will swiftly
appear with some excuse,

314
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,400
liberating you from your engagement.

315
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,150
He'll lie, in other words.

316
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,800
Yes, but he'll have plenty of time
and opportunity to repent.

317
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,600
Well, Holy Father, if you agree,

318
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:46,650
I would like to start
with our top priorities.

319
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,200
The most urgent of them all

320
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,300
is your first homily
in Saint Peter's Square.

321
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,700
There is a great deal of agitation
about it,

322
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,200
something which I,
in my long career,

323
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,200
have never quite seen before.

324
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,800
The entire office of the Secretary
of State is working on it.

325
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:07,650
I myself worked all night long
on a rough draft,

326
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,700
which I would like to submit you.

327
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,200
The press and the faithful
who are coming here

328
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,700
from every corner of the globe

329
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:19,200
were all convinced that you were
going to deliver your homily today.

330
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,900
We did an excellent job
at curbing their spirits,

331
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,950
but at the same time,
Your Holiness,

332
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,150
I am sorry to say that
we can only delay for so long.

333
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,050
Tomorrow would be ideal.

334
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,050
There, this is the most pressing issue.

335
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:42,400
The most pressing issue is my need
for a cup of an American coffee.

336
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,300
Would you make me one,
Your Eminence?

337
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,650
Certainly. Amatucci.

338
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,150
I didn't ask him.

339
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,050
I asked you.

340
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,550
It will be a pleasure
and an honor for me

341
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,050
to bring you coffee, Your Holiness.

342
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:26,100
- Thank you, Your Eminence.
- It's my duty, Blessed Father.

343
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,700
Holy Father, now,
about your homily,

344
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,900
how would we like to proceed, then?

345
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,200
Later.

346
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,800
And has the Holy Father already
thought of some candidates

347
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,400
for the delicate role
of a special assistant?

348
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,400
- I have an idea.
- I have too.

349
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,050
Monsignor Gemelli
comes to mind...

350
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,750
My idea is Sister Mary.

351
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:26,250
An admirable idea, Your Holiness,

352
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,700
and completely understandable.

353
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,350
Allow me to add, however,
that unfortunately,

354
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,500
the Curia has complex mechanisms

355
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:40,150
which might seem like astrophysics.

356
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,300
Therefore, the Holy Father's
inevitable lack of experience,

357
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,600
together with Sister Mary's
inevitable lack of experience

358
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:51,900
would lead me to suggest
an internal contribution...

359
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:56,600
Of course I realize how central
Sister Mary seems to you.

360
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:00,700
We could invent a sort of
ad hoc role for her.

361
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,700
We won't lack for imagination
around here.

362
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,050
Yeah,

363
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:11,050
you're exactly right,
Voiello, she's central.

364
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:15,800
Sister Mary took me in at her
orphanage when I was 7 years old,

365
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:18,700
she raised me and she loved me.
She made me a good Christian.

366
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,250
A great Christian!

367
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:26,500
Monsignor Gemelli is experienced,
I would rely on him.

368
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,750
Perhaps you didn't hear me
correctly.

369
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:33,950
Perhaps, Holy Father.
My English does have its limits.

370
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,450
You'd better improve it then.

371
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:41,000
Sister Mary
will be my special assistant.

372
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,400
As you wish, Holy Father.

373
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:46,700
Then, of course, there is
the matter of drafting

374
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,700
and delivering your address
to the College of Cardinals.

375
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,450
They're all still here.

376
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,900
They will not leave the Vatican
until you address them.

377
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,400
Later.

378
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,000
In the office of the Secretary,

379
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,450
we have been wondering if the Holy
Father

380
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,900
would care to provide us
with some indications regarding

381
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:10,100
the draft of an encyclical.

382
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,450
Later.

383
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,700
The prefects of the various
congregations are of course

384
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:18,550
eager to see you
with their own eyes.

385
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,900
But I imagine that you would like
to deal with this matter... later.

386
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,450
No, now.

387
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:30,050
First off, I want to meet the Prefect
for the Congregation for the Clergy.

388
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,800
At any rate, Holy Father,

389
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:39,100
I understand your reluctance
about the encyclical.

390
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,600
Your predecessor always
made me laugh

391
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,300
when he said

392
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:47,800
that an encyclical is like
Proust's "In Search of Lost Time".

393
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:51,350
Everyone quotes it,
but no one reads it.

394
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,000
Are you sleeping, Holy Father?

395
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,700
No Your Eminence, I'm praying.

396
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,800
For you.

397
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,500
Stop looking at the Venus
of Willendorf in that way.

398
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,650
Holy Father, Holy Father, smoking
is not allowed in the papal palace!

399
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,400
Is that so?

400
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,450
Who decided that?

401
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:52,500
John Paul II.

402
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,500
- The Pope?
- Yes, the Pope.

403
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,050
There's a new Pope now.

404
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,550
True.

405
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,600
- Your Eminence...
- Yes, Holy Father.

406
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,250
You're too tied to the past.

407
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,050
They say the same thing about you,
Your Holiness.

408
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:17,800
The past is an enormous place,
with all sorts of things inside.

409
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,350
Not so with the present.

410
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,150
The present is merely
a narrow opening,

411
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,600
with room for only
one pair of eyes.

412
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,300
Mine.

413
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,050
- Your eminence.
- Yes.

414
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,900
Our top priorities.

415
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:04,400
Here I am. As I was saying...

416
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:07,800
You will be in charge of politics,

417
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:10,700
finance, theology,

418
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,100
appointments and promotions.

419
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,700
I will take care
of worldly matters,

420
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,800
travel, adulation of the masses,
celebrations.

421
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:22,550
A most effective division of roles,
Holy Father.

422
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,000
- Your Eminence.
- Yes, Blessed Father?

423
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,750
I was just kidding.

424
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:33,250
- That wasn't obvious?
- Hardly!

425
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:38,900
So, as I was saying,
our top priorities are...

426
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:43,150
One: the Radio Vatican signal
needs boosting.

427
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,700
It is unacceptable
that reception is so poor.

428
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:51,450
Two: the pope wants to see
all the gifts the pope receives.

429
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,550
Have a storage space fitted out for
storing all the gifts I receive.

430
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,800
Three: the Vatican must immediately
buy back the papal tiara

431
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:02,700
from the basilica
in Washington DC,

432
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:07,950
which my predecessors, who
favoured sobriety over tradition,

433
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,950
imprudently let go.

434
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,050
And four:

435
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,950
Sister Mary will also look after you.

436
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:20,400
She will oversee
all your activities

437
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:23,350
and report directly back to me.

438
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,450
She will be your guardian angel.

439
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,700
I'm sixty years, Holy Father.

440
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,600
I don't need a guardian angel.

441
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:38,100
Oh, we all need a guardian angel,
Voiello.

442
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,750
Especially unscrupulous,
ambiguous men.

443
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:45,700
Then, please,
allow me to choose mine myself.

444
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,900
In another life.

445
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,900
In this life,

446
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:53,600
the Pope chooses
your guardian angel for you.

447
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:57,400
And he is the Pope.

448
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,650
Did you call for me, Holy Father?

449
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,150
Papa!

450
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:43,900
It all comes back to this
in the end, doesn't it?

451
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,450
To the mother.

452
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:52,250
How was your mother like,
Monsignor Gutierrez?

453
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:00,150
She was a woman
who did not scorn wickedness.

454
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,900
And it had the effect of creating
a son full of goodness.

455
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,500
I've inquired about you.

456
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,450
Everyone tells me you are
a shining example of goodness.

457
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,700
I thank you for believing them,
Holy Father.

458
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,050
It is I who should thank you,

459
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,400
for allowing me to be here
without hordes of tourists.

460
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,600
That's my duty, Holy Father.

461
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,400
Was it hard, close off
the Basilica to tourists?

462
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:32,800
No, no, all we had to do was
hang up a sign saying "closed".

463
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,650
I will never shed
my aversion to tourists.

464
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:51,750
Why is that, Holy Father?

465
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,150
Because they are
just passing through.

466
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:12,000
I was late because
I couldn't find your office.

467
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,350
I know.
You opened the wrong door

468
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,700
and found yourself face to face
with some visitors to our museum.

469
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,800
So you've been inquired
about me too.

470
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:24,800
It's very difficult to keep
anything secret in the Vatican.

471
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,400
Rumors fly so quickly

472
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:32,750
that sometimes they arrive even
before the event has taken place.

473
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:37,450
That's quite a useful piece
of information for my future.

474
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,800
Which is exactly what it was
intended to be, Holy Father.

475
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:45,000
Ah, what is one to do, Monsignor?

476
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:49,400
It's the times.
In America, we call it gossip.

477
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:53,450
Here in the Vatican
we call it calumny.

478
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:55,950
This way.

479
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,500
How many years have you been
at the Vatican?

480
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:13,150
So many that
I've stopped to counting.

481
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,900
Do you like it here?

482
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:17,500
Yes, I feel safe here.

483
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,550
It's as if time were dead.

484
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:27,550
Speaking of that time,

485
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,850
the other day, during the Conclave,

486
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,800
I read an Italian newspaper.

487
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:37,950
It was an article about
this politician

488
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,300
who had hidden
some compromising files

489
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:44,600
in the gaps
between the walls of his house.

490
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:46,700
Yes, I read about that as well.

491
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,950
I thought...

492
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:55,150
I wouldn't need to hide anything
in the gaps in my house.

493
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,450
Because my mind is a gap.

494
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,200
And everything that
is hidden from me,

495
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,350
sooner or later

496
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,550
is revealed.

497
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:19,250
As if it were
being entrusted to me.

498
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,800
A precious skill
for leading the Church.

499
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:31,350
It's not a skill, Gutierrez...

500
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:35,500
it's my destiny!

501
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:32,450
Federico, do you know why
all the good souls of this world

502
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,100
- rage against power?
- Why, Your Eminence?

503
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:39,050
Because they simply
don't know what it is.

504
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:41,800
What is it?

505
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,200
Power is knowledge.

506
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:50,200
What is it you want to know,
Eminence?

507
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:55,450
Who is Pius XIII? Or rather,
who was Lenny Belardo?

508
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,800
You need to carry out
a small investigation,

509
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:01,200
discreet but thorough.

510
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:04,850
His week spots, his trials
and tribulations, his sins.

511
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,700
Especially his sins.

512
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,900
Because the sins we commit
in the past are the same ones

513
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:13,600
we'll commit in the future.

514
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:18,050
Because man is like God.
He never changes.

515
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,700
I'll start right in.

516
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,300
But is the situation of this papacy
already that serious?

517
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:27,400
No, not yet.
But if it were to become so,

518
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:28,600
we'll be ready.

519
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,500
Because the powerful
may have knowledge,

520
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,950
but they don't realize what it
takes to be more powerful than anyone else.

521
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,050
And what does it take?

522
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,400
See how beautiful it is?

523
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,850
It takes getting knowledge
before anyone else does.

524
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:48,950
Fabulous.

525
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,100
Go on, Tommaso, don't be afraid.

526
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,550
But violating the secret
of the confessional is...

527
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,700
No, no, it's not,

528
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:10,200
not if the
information is intended for me,

529
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,550
the Pontiff, and is for
the survival of our Church.

530
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:17,450
Don't disappoint me, Tommaso.

531
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,200
Your Holiness, I'm just a poor,
simple priest,

532
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,900
and the secret of the confessional

533
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:27,200
is the only respectable thing
I have.

534
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:30,250
Today. But think of tomorrow.

535
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,800
Scarlet robes and the ring
are in your future.

536
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:39,400
The cardinalship, my dear.
Which is much more respectable.

537
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,850
What if someone hears us?

538
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:47,300
Only he can hear us up here.

539
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:50,850
Who knows where he is?

540
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:57,350
There! By the big dipper.

541
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,100
That's where God's house is.

542
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:05,750
God's house! What's it like?

543
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:10,800
Half of a duplex,
with a private swimming pool.

544
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:15,850
Come on now, tell me people's sins.

545
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:19,950
Well,

546
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,400
have I already told you
about Voiello's impure thoughts

547
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:27,950
about the Venus of Willendorf?

548
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,850
Yes, yes you told me already.
What else?

549
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,050
No, nothing...

550
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,350
Cardinal Aguirre
did an imitation of you today,

551
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,200
Your Holiness.

552
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,900
- Everyone laughed.
- Did you laugh?

553
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:59,150
Yes, but to myself.
So no one noticed.

554
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,000
Good. What else?

555
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:10,600
Everybody is wondering
who Sister Mary is to you,

556
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,350
what she's doing here.

557
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,350
What else?

558
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,150
Everybody is also wondering:

559
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,950
is the Pope thinking about
his first homily?

560
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,450
I ask myself
the same thing all the time.

561
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,150
Of course I'm thinking about it.

562
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,000
It's all I think about.
I even dreamed about it.

563
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:36,700
I'm let you in on a secret:

564
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,950
ever since I was little, I've
learned to confound people's ideas

565
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,250
on what's going on in my head.

566
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:46,500
You're so wise, Holy Father.

567
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:49,000
Not only that,

568
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:54,450
I'm also
intransigent, irritable,

569
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,850
vindictive...

570
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:03,100
and I have a prodigious memory.

571
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:06,700
And now I want to make
my confession.

572
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:10,900
- Fine. Let's go back downstairs.
- No, here.

573
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:13,300
Before the house of God.

574
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,700
Oh... okay.

575
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,700
In nomine Patris,
et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

576
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:28,050
God, my conscience
is not accuse me,

577
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,950
because you do not believe
I am capable of repenting.

578
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,500
And therefore,
I do not believe in you.

579
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:41,700
I don't believe you are capable
of saving me from myself.

580
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:46,800
Holy father, what are you saying?

581
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,100
I'm saying that
I don't believe in God, Tommaso.

582
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:54,600
What are you saying,
Blessed Father?!

583
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:56,200
Tommaso, Tommaso.

584
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:01,150
I was joking.
