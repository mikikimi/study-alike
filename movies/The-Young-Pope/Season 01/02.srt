1
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:15,600
Say something, Esther.

2
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:17,476
I love you.

3
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,309
Say something else.

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,934
No.

5
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:32,226
You don't love me.

6
00:00:33,518 --> 00:00:35,059
Yes, I do.

7
00:00:36,392 --> 00:00:39,142
But love's not enough for you.

8
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:42,184
Sex has its own rules.

9
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:48,434
Sex only has one rule: procreation.

10
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:30,600
No...

11
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:33,934
Are you Sister Mary?

12
00:02:33,975 --> 00:02:35,975
Never call me Sister Mary.

13
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:38,017
Call me Ma'.

14
00:02:38,683 --> 00:02:40,101
Ok.

15
00:02:52,184 --> 00:02:55,599
You've aged, Andrew,
but you've kept your good looks.

16
00:02:56,892 --> 00:02:59,892
You've aged too, Ma,
but you haven't.

17
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:02,725
I should have followed my instincts
and broken open the alms box

18
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:06,559
and then spent all the money
on a good plastic surgeon.

19
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,683
You have ever regretted
becoming a nun?

20
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:11,599
No! If I hadn't become a nun,

21
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,226
I never would have raised my two
precious jewels: you and Lenny.

22
00:03:17,809 --> 00:03:21,017
The Pope is a jewel. I'm just
a bungling missionary priest.

23
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:25,184
You're both jewels, Andrew.
And besides, you're a cardinal.

24
00:03:25,226 --> 00:03:29,599
Yeah. Which means nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

25
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,476
But we aren't here to talk
about me, Ma. How's our pope?

26
00:03:33,518 --> 00:03:34,934
In seventh heaven!

27
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:37,267
In seventh heaven, right.

28
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:40,600
I mean, who would ever imagined

29
00:03:40,642 --> 00:03:42,767
that Lenny would become pope!

30
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,434
Me.

31
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,642
I should go now.

32
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:51,184
It's never a good idea for a nun
to be in a cardinal's room.

33
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:54,518
Well, if you see our Pope, tell him
to hurry up and give his address,

34
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:58,434
because I would like to get
back to my good works.

35
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:01,683
Or bad ones,
that remains to be seen.

36
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,309
Don't you like it here?

37
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:09,559
This place smells like
incense and death.

38
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:12,642
I prefer
the smell of shit and life.

39
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:15,559
You haven't changed at all, I see.

40
00:04:15,892 --> 00:04:17,809
And you, Ma?

41
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,850
Will you change?

42
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:23,142
Now that you've become
a powerful woman?

43
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:30,434
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

44
00:04:32,518 --> 00:04:35,226
I don't know if
it's a good idea, Sofia.

45
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:38,184
- I'm afraid it's premature.
- Premature, Your Eminence?

46
00:04:38,226 --> 00:04:40,934
The time it takes to develop
and update the merchandise,

47
00:04:40,975 --> 00:04:42,559
it means we have
to move right away,

48
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:44,642
before the fakes start appearing.

49
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:47,434
The crooks are always so much
faster, who knows how they do it.

50
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:48,975
Criminal organizations are faster

51
00:04:49,017 --> 00:04:50,975
because they don't
forgive inefficiency.

52
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:53,934
At the risk of seeming too
materialistic, Your Eminence,

53
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:56,767
do you know how much the Vatican
coffers lose for every day

54
00:04:56,809 --> 00:05:00,309
that passes without any new papal
merchandizing on the market?

55
00:05:00,392 --> 00:05:02,017
Not exactly.

56
00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:08,975
- Wow. - Now
do you understand why I need

57
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,725
the Holy Father's
immediate approval?

58
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,892
Yes, I do. But you don't know him.

59
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:17,017
And believe me,
he's not an easy one.

60
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:19,725
He's a difficult,
unpredictable man.

61
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:22,434
So? I'm a difficult,
unpredictable woman.

62
00:05:22,476 --> 00:05:24,267
True. Which is precisely
why I'm worried.

63
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:27,226
Let me handle it.
You'll see, it'll go fine.

64
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:30,683
- Help us, Pipita.
- Who's Saint Pipita?

65
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:34,351
He's not a saint, he's
the center forward for Napoli.

66
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:37,184
What a lame joke.

67
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:40,559
I see you've lost your optimism
along with your sense of humor.

68
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:44,476
Sense of humor is irrelevant
for the Secretary of State.

69
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:06,267
May I smoke as well, Holy Father?

70
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:07,725
Unfortunately not.

71
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:12,101
His Holiness John Paul II,
in his day, forbid it.

72
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,434
May I tell you something,
Holy Father?

73
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:20,599
- That's why we're here.
- With all due respect,

74
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,476
seen from up close, you are
an extraordinarily handsome man.

75
00:06:26,975 --> 00:06:30,267
I had asked to meet the Prefect
for the Congregation for the Clergy

76
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:33,642
before anyone else, and you,
I think it's safe to deduce,

77
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:36,767
are not the Prefect for
the Congregation for the Clergy.

78
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:39,392
No, but I would like to be.

79
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:42,725
So would I.
But they made me Pope, instead.

80
00:06:45,142 --> 00:06:47,767
I'm in charge of marketing
here in Vatican City.

81
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,309
Did you study marketing in college?

82
00:06:49,351 --> 00:06:51,059
At Harvard, to be precise.

83
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:52,392
Don't sound so cocky.

84
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:54,476
The word "Harvard"
may impress people around here,

85
00:06:54,518 --> 00:06:57,934
but to an American, it means
one thing only: decline.

86
00:06:58,975 --> 00:07:01,476
Did you know that
when the Archbishop of Boston

87
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:03,017
would visit Harvard,

88
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:06,599
he'd boast to everyone
that he never washed his feet?

89
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,850
It was public knowledge, and at
Easter, at the washing of the feet,

90
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:13,518
everyone was terrified
that the Archbishop of Boston

91
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,184
might be chosen.

92
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,559
As soon as I became his superior,
I sent him three envelopes.

93
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:21,725
In the first was a letter
transferring him to Alaska,

94
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:23,059
in the second was some soap,

95
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:26,683
and in the third a note card
on which I'd written: "choose".

96
00:07:26,725 --> 00:07:28,309
And what did he choose?

97
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:30,142
- The soap.
- I imagined.

98
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,850
Right. But what you couldn't
possibly have imagined

99
00:07:31,892 --> 00:07:34,184
was the fourth letter I sent him.

100
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:37,600
"Excellent choice, Archbishop",
I wrote.

101
00:07:37,642 --> 00:07:40,767
"You'll find plenty
of water in Alaska."

102
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:43,850
A most edifying anecdote,
Holy Father.

103
00:07:43,934 --> 00:07:45,184
But I don't want
to waste your time,

104
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:47,600
so let me come right
to the point of my visit.

105
00:07:47,642 --> 00:07:49,434
- Please.
- As you know, Your Holiness,

106
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:50,683
the Vatican holds a monopoly

107
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:52,892
on the production of any
and all merchandise

108
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:54,683
with an image of the Pope on it.

109
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:58,599
Today's papal turnover requires
us to come up with new designs,

110
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,434
which we will then need to get into
production as quickly as possible.

111
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:04,850
All those items with the Holy
Father's picture on them,

112
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:06,267
which the faithful just love

113
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:09,599
and which make up a sizable slice
of the Vatican budget.

114
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,683
I see. Go on.

115
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:13,642
What would be required then
is a brief photo shoot,

116
00:08:13,683 --> 00:08:16,683
which will then enable us to get
into production as soon as possible

117
00:08:16,725 --> 00:08:20,017
a series of items displaying
Your Holiness's picture:

118
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:23,892
key chains, postcards, ashtrays,
lighters, picture cards, plates...

119
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:27,600
- Plates? - Yes, of course,
Holy Father, plates too.

120
00:08:27,642 --> 00:08:31,518
In addition to the usual plastic
plates, which sell for five euro,

121
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:34,142
we were thinking
of something more refined.

122
00:08:34,184 --> 00:08:37,184
It occurred to us that we might
commission a special plate

123
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,725
from Vietri, in Campania.

124
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:43,226
The craftsmen there do
the most marvelous decorations,

125
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:47,725
so naturally we were thinking of
creating a plate with your portrait

126
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:52,434
right in the center, painted by
the very best Vietri's craftsmen.

127
00:08:52,476 --> 00:08:54,642
Nice.
And how much would it sell for?

128
00:08:54,683 --> 00:08:56,101
Forty-five euro, at least.

129
00:08:56,142 --> 00:08:58,142
Ah, a reasonable price.

130
00:08:58,184 --> 00:09:01,017
I would say so, considering
that we're talking about

131
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:03,559
a craftsmanship,
Holy Father, handmade,

132
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:06,184
not some cheap factory production.

133
00:09:06,226 --> 00:09:10,184
Perhaps we could send one
to all the heads of State.

134
00:09:10,226 --> 00:09:13,059
An excellent idea, Your Eminence.

135
00:09:14,392 --> 00:09:16,559
Good, very good.

136
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:18,434
Very good.

137
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:20,351
- Good. - Very good.
- Yes, very, very good.

138
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:23,142
- Very, very good.
- Good.

139
00:09:26,518 --> 00:09:28,600
Wait a minute. I'll be right back.

140
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:29,892
Good.

141
00:09:36,934 --> 00:09:38,392
Where did he go?

142
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:40,518
To get a gun, I imagine.

143
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,642
Come on! It went fine.

144
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,975
Do you see this plate, ma'am?

145
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:03,600
Yes... of course I see it.

146
00:10:03,642 --> 00:10:04,767
Good.

147
00:10:05,642 --> 00:10:09,809
This is the sort of merchandise
I'm prepared to authorize.

148
00:10:10,184 --> 00:10:11,850
But it doesn't have your image
on it!

149
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:15,850
I do not have an image,
my good lady, because I am no one.

150
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:19,351
Do you understand? No one.

151
00:10:19,392 --> 00:10:21,518
Only Christ exists.

152
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,392
Only Christ.

153
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:27,309
And I'm not worth forty-five,
or even five euros.

154
00:10:27,351 --> 00:10:29,934
I am worth nothing.

155
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:32,934
I don't understand, Holy Father.

156
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:34,351
Of course you don't,

157
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:37,850
because, as you said earlier,
you studied at Harvard.

158
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:40,642
And Harvard is a place in decline,

159
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,559
where you were taught
to lower yourselves.

160
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:48,142
Whereas here, in the Vatican,
we try to elevate ourselves.

161
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:52,184
Who exactly is in charge
of curating the image of the Pope?

162
00:10:52,226 --> 00:10:55,683
The Secretary of State entrusted
that delicate task to me,

163
00:10:55,725 --> 00:10:57,351
Holy Father, two years ago.

164
00:10:57,392 --> 00:10:59,352
Very good. And now I'm going
to tell you what you,

165
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,642
as curator of the image
of the Holy Father, are gonna do.

166
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:06,642
You are gonna fire the Vatican's
official photographer immediately.

167
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:10,309
No photographs of the Pope
are to be issued.

168
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:13,059
Just as there were none
when I was a cardinal or a bishop.

169
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:17,351
Do you know why? I never allowed
my picture to be taken.

170
00:11:17,392 --> 00:11:19,809
And when someone manage
to sneak a photograph of me,

171
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,476
I always bought them up
before they could be published.

172
00:11:22,518 --> 00:11:23,934
Now that I think about it,

173
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,892
I've been training my whole life
to be an invisible pope.

174
00:11:26,934 --> 00:11:29,017
And so, for my first address,
you will see to it

175
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:31,476
that the light is so dim,
no photographer,

176
00:11:31,518 --> 00:11:33,850
no TV cameraman,
and not even the faithful

177
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:38,101
will see anything of me
but a dark shadow, my silhouette.

178
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:41,850
They will not see me
because I do not exist.

179
00:11:41,892 --> 00:11:44,476
If I may, Holy Father,
what you are proposing

180
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:47,226
is nothing short of suicide,
media suicide.

181
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:49,975
Media suicide, you say?

182
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:54,559
Fine, now try to keep up with me,
if you can.

183
00:11:54,642 --> 00:11:56,767
- I'm right with you, Holy Father.
- Good.

184
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,476
Ok, so, who is the most important
author of the last twenty years?

185
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,809
Careful now, not the best,
virtuosity is for the arrogant,

186
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,599
the most important,
the author who has sparked

187
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,975
so much morbid curiosity that
he became the most important?

188
00:12:15,142 --> 00:12:17,934
I wouldn't know.
I'd say... Philip Roth.

189
00:12:18,017 --> 00:12:19,767
No. Salinger.

190
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:22,434
The most important film director?

191
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,559
- Spielberg.
- No. Kubrick.

192
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:26,518
Contemporary artist?

193
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:28,476
Jeff Koons. Or Marina Abramovic.

194
00:12:28,518 --> 00:12:30,392
Banksy. Electronic music group?

195
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:33,809
I don't know the first thing
about electronic music.

196
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:38,476
You say Harvard is a good
university! Anyway, Daft Punk.

197
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,434
The best Italian female vocalist?

198
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:44,934
- Mina?
- Very good!

199
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:46,850
Now do you know what it is,

200
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,599
what the invisible red thread
is that connects them all,

201
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,226
all these most important figures
in their respective fields?

202
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:57,351
None of them
let themselves be seen.

203
00:12:57,392 --> 00:13:00,683
None of them let themselves
be photographed.

204
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,600
But you're not an artist, Holy
Father. You are a head of State.

205
00:13:07,518 --> 00:13:12,642
Yes, of a city state so small
that it has no outlet to the sea,

206
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,434
and in order to survive,
its leader has to make himself

207
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:19,599
as unreachable as a rock star.

208
00:13:20,184 --> 00:13:22,518
The Vatican survives
thanks to hyperbole.

209
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:28,809
So we, we shall generate hyperbole,
but this time in reverse.

210
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:33,184
I'm beginning to get your point,
Holy Father.

211
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:37,809
Yes, not only am I beginning to get
it, I'm beginning to like it, too.

212
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:41,434
Good, very good.

213
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:45,850
Childhood?

214
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,184
His parents, both hippies,

215
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:52,600
abandon him at an orphanage, and
they give fake names to Sister Mary

216
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:56,683
making it impossible for Lenny
to find them.

217
00:13:56,767 --> 00:14:01,017
Sister Mary's orphanage has ties
to Cardinal Spencer's university.

218
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:03,017
Spencer at that time
was in New York.

219
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,309
Of all her little orphans,

220
00:14:04,351 --> 00:14:06,725
the only one she recommends
to him was Lenny.

221
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:09,476
A British newspaper got the scoop

222
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:13,101
with the headline
"The Pope smokes".

223
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:17,059
And this is how
the world responded.

224
00:14:17,101 --> 00:14:18,434
At Spencer's side we're familiar

225
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:19,876
with the direction
his career takes.

226
00:14:19,934 --> 00:14:24,101
Lenny succeeds him when Spencer
is called to the Curia.

227
00:14:24,142 --> 00:14:27,017
Very young, he takes over the
entire Archdiocese of New York.

228
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:29,642
He is a cardinal at the age of 42.

229
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:34,267
But if Lenny was so submissive,
so dull...

230
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:36,351
why did Spencer favor him so much?

231
00:14:36,392 --> 00:14:39,767
Precisely because he never
threatened Spencer's boundless ego.

232
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:44,059
And besides, Spencer has always
preferred servile underlings.

233
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:47,226
But now, he's the one
who has to serve that little boy.

234
00:14:47,683 --> 00:14:51,226
- Lenny's moral conduct?
- Irreproachable.

235
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:53,934
No gossip,
no insinuations even.

236
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:56,476
No love affairs. Nothing.

237
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:00,809
- Sexual orientation?
- Unknown.

238
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:03,809
And what do you think his
sexual orientation is?

239
00:15:06,725 --> 00:15:08,101
None.

240
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:11,226
He only cares about the Church.

241
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:12,892
And the Church is female.

242
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:17,059
"Dear Pope, what do I have
to do to believe in God?"

243
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:19,683
Tommy, Amarillo, Texas".

244
00:15:21,184 --> 00:15:23,642
I want you to write back
to all the children.

245
00:15:23,683 --> 00:15:25,226
Of course, Holy Father.

246
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:28,184
And how would you respond
to this child, Eminence?

247
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:32,559
- I....
- You'd write back and say:

248
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:37,476
"Dear Tommy, think
of all the things you like.

249
00:15:39,101 --> 00:15:42,351
There, that's what God is".

250
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:46,725
I knew it, there are mice in here.

251
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:51,309
That's no mouse.

252
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:12,683
A gift from the Australian
Foreign Minister, Holy Father.

253
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:15,392
We thought we would donate it
to the bio park.

254
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,226
- What do you mean "bio park"?
- The zoo.

255
00:16:19,642 --> 00:16:21,809
Not on your life.

256
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:49,934
You can come out, sweetie.

257
00:17:32,392 --> 00:17:35,309
We'll set him free in the gardens.

258
00:17:47,351 --> 00:17:50,392
Do you intend to follow me even
in my more private moments?

259
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:54,226
I wasn't following you.
I too enjoy communing with nature.

260
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:55,850
Well, what do you know?

261
00:17:55,892 --> 00:17:58,392
Just one day,
and we've already discovered

262
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:00,809
we have something in common.

263
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:04,559
- Don't be funny with me.
- I've never been more serious.

264
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:07,809
And worried. About the Pope.

265
00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:14,351
The Pope is a saint. Let him
be the one to worry about you.

266
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:19,850
Yes, I've been told he chats with
kangaroos, a San Francis of Sydney.

267
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:23,267
By "saint"
I don't mean "a good man".

268
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:25,559
I mean he's literally a saint.

269
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,683
The Holy Father and you would do
well to be a little more humble.

270
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:31,767
The Vatican is a State.

271
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:34,476
There is politics, finances,

272
00:18:34,518 --> 00:18:36,226
there are delicate balances

273
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:40,434
and grave dangers,
if those balances are upset.

274
00:18:40,476 --> 00:18:43,017
Yes, but there are also lobbies,

275
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:47,683
internal tensions, scandals,
vendettas, and threats.

276
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:51,434
All of this the Holy Father
understands only too well.

277
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:55,559
His bizarre refusal to show himself
in public is just crazy.

278
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:59,351
To reveal his eyes, right now,

279
00:19:00,518 --> 00:19:03,892
maybe too much,
too much for the world.

280
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:08,392
- I'm afraid I don't follow you.
- You will, one day.

281
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:12,184
At any rate, let me reassure
you that we intend to tackle

282
00:19:12,226 --> 00:19:15,017
all the concerns
that you have raised, one by one.

283
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:19,267
We? Who's we? You and the Pope?

284
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:21,642
Do we have two popes now?

285
00:19:21,683 --> 00:19:25,351
We also intended tackle the
question of the Secretary of State.

286
00:19:27,142 --> 00:19:30,434
It's a good thing you've come,
Sister Mary,

287
00:19:30,476 --> 00:19:32,892
I was getting bored.

288
00:19:33,017 --> 00:19:36,059
I must admit,
you're a first-class adversary.

289
00:19:36,101 --> 00:19:39,975
At any rate, here is the address
I wrote for him.

290
00:19:40,017 --> 00:19:42,559
I worked on it all night long.

291
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,142
It's a good address.
It's well balanced, prudent,

292
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:49,434
and takes account
of various positions.

293
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:51,599
It's diplomatic, in other words.

294
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,351
Haven't you realized the Pope
is indifferent to diplomacy?

295
00:19:55,392 --> 00:19:57,518
Yes, and wrongly so.

296
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:59,559
We are an anomalous State,

297
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,059
and diplomacy
is the only thing we have,

298
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:07,476
other than a handful of buildings
and some works of art.

299
00:20:07,518 --> 00:20:10,226
Let me say again,
it's a good address.

300
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:14,934
I have infused it with all
my the commitment, all my passion.

301
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:23,518
- Have you already seen Dussolier?
- Ehm... no. Not yet.

302
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:27,975
Do you have any ideas
for your first address?

303
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:32,184
Because you could ask
Spencer for advice.

304
00:20:32,226 --> 00:20:34,518
I don't need Spencer's advice.

305
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:42,600
That incident today,
with the kangaroo was...

306
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:45,642
Stop it. It was nothing.

307
00:20:45,683 --> 00:20:48,559
- Just chance.
- Okay, just chance.

308
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:52,518
- And that time when we were...
- Stop it.

309
00:21:02,226 --> 00:21:03,642
Good evening, Eminence.

310
00:21:03,683 --> 00:21:04,975
Good evening.

311
00:21:10,892 --> 00:21:12,434
Yes?

312
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:17,351
Really?

313
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:44,142
So, how are you?

314
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:49,642
I have to tell you a wonderful
thing that happened to Higuain.

315
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:58,267
My dear faithful ones,
I'm sorry I'm late.

316
00:22:59,267 --> 00:23:01,142
Laughter from the audience.

317
00:23:02,934 --> 00:23:05,101
But here I am.

318
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:06,850
Look at me.

319
00:23:06,892 --> 00:23:11,017
Only don't look at me. Look up.

320
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:16,142
The Pope points
to the sky and the stars.

321
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:20,725
Do you see the sky?

322
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:24,518
Do you see God? No?

323
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,975
You don't see Him?

324
00:23:28,476 --> 00:23:30,059
No matter.

325
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:34,559
Now look
at the person next to you.

326
00:23:35,101 --> 00:23:40,226
Look joyfully upon him, and
remember what Saint Augustine said:

327
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:44,518
"If you want to see God,

328
00:23:45,184 --> 00:23:48,017
you have the means to do it.

329
00:23:49,476 --> 00:23:51,309
God is love."

330
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,000
Thank you, Sister Mary.

331
00:24:20,476 --> 00:24:22,725
So, I finally get to meet

332
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:32,892
the Prefect for
the Congregation for the Clergy.

333
00:24:32,934 --> 00:24:35,725
I've been anxious to see you.

334
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,683
Here I am, Holy Father.

335
00:24:40,142 --> 00:24:42,476
Did you vote for me in
the Conclave, Your Eminence?

336
00:24:45,934 --> 00:24:49,434
Not even once.

337
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:52,975
Why not?

338
00:24:53,017 --> 00:24:54,599
Even though I don't know
your ideas,

339
00:24:56,809 --> 00:24:59,599
in truth, no one does,

340
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,725
you are a pupil
of Cardinal Spencer.

341
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:04,809
Cardinal Spencer is
a conservative, a moderate one,

342
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:07,850
but a conservative nonetheless.

343
00:25:07,892 --> 00:25:10,559
I am not a conservative.

344
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,599
I figured that you were probably
a conservative as well.

345
00:25:15,226 --> 00:25:19,351
Are you, Holy Father?

346
00:25:21,017 --> 00:25:23,226
What do you think?

347
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,142
I think that if the name
you have chosen, Pius XIII,

348
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:33,809
is intended to signal
a continuity with Pius XII,

349
00:25:34,476 --> 00:25:38,850
then there is
the reason for concern.

350
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:43,683
Let's not forget that Pius XI
considered Mussolini

351
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:47,392
to be a man of divine providence.

352
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:49,892
At any rate, the College
of Cardinals was very rash

353
00:25:51,392 --> 00:25:53,934
to elect a pontiff whose ideas
and orientation they did not know.

354
00:25:53,975 --> 00:26:00,809
I agree with you.

355
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:06,599
It was rash.

356
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,184
At any rate, Holy Father, please
do not take this as a criticism,

357
00:26:08,226 --> 00:26:12,683
or think that this will
in any way dampen my obedience.

358
00:26:12,725 --> 00:26:16,434
You asked me a question

359
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:19,892
I considered it my duty
to respond truthfully.

360
00:26:19,934 --> 00:26:23,518
I appreciate your sincerity.

361
00:26:24,975 --> 00:26:28,434
I'm going to ask you
another question,

362
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:35,642
and you will grant me the courtesy
of another sincere answer.

363
00:26:35,725 --> 00:26:39,434
Of course, Holy Father.

364
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:41,683
Are you homosexual, Your Eminence?

365
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:50,059
Yes, Holy Father.

366
00:27:15,725 --> 00:27:17,767
Time for your snack, Holy Father.

367
00:27:44,518 --> 00:27:47,101
- My snack?
- Yes, Holy Father, your snack.

368
00:27:52,226 --> 00:27:56,267
Right, that's what she calls it.

369
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:59,017
I have to have my snack now.

370
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:04,599
Goodbye, Your Eminence.

371
00:28:06,975 --> 00:28:09,142
I saw Sister Mary coming out
of Cardinal Dussolier's room.

372
00:28:18,642 --> 00:28:23,101
What else?

373
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:26,226
People are saying that Sister Mary
is the real Pope, not you.

374
00:28:27,184 --> 00:28:31,184
Who's saying that?

375
00:28:31,518 --> 00:28:33,226
Cardinal Ozolins.

376
00:28:33,642 --> 00:28:35,809
He's heard it said that Sister Mary

377
00:28:36,226 --> 00:28:38,600
uses "we" when she talks
about the Pope.

378
00:28:38,642 --> 00:28:41,809
"We will do, we will tackle..."

379
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,267
I overheard him talking to
the Vatican Secretary of State:

380
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:48,184
"Lenny semper puer", he said.

381
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,434
And how did the Vatican Secretary
of State react?

382
00:28:53,226 --> 00:28:56,267
He was impassive.
He's a clever devil, that one.

383
00:28:57,351 --> 00:29:00,975
But it's a lie, what Ozolins says.

384
00:29:01,892 --> 00:29:04,892
It is a lie.

385
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,599
Isn't it, Holy Father?

386
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,434
Of course it's a lie.

387
00:29:11,476 --> 00:29:13,518
A woman will never become the pope.

388
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,101
I am the Pope.

389
00:29:17,226 --> 00:29:18,975
Good morning, Mrs. Patanè.

390
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:25,142
Good morning, Cardinal Ozolins.

391
00:29:25,518 --> 00:29:28,101
This office is falling apart,
I'm quite fed up.

392
00:29:32,351 --> 00:29:36,017
Give me a hand, Mrs. Patanè.

393
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:38,599
How many times have
I said it needs to be renovated?

394
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,600
Ah, here you are. What alacrity.

395
00:29:41,642 --> 00:29:44,767
It's enough to raise
one's voice around here

396
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:50,392
for things to get resolved.

397
00:29:50,434 --> 00:29:52,267
The door won't open.

398
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:53,809
The door, the key.

399
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:56,142
Aguirre!

400
00:29:58,975 --> 00:30:00,434
How can I thank you, Holy Father,

401
00:30:06,351 --> 00:30:09,017
for having entrusted
the Vatican Museums to me?

402
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:12,767
There's no need to thank me.

403
00:30:15,518 --> 00:30:17,767
What made you enter the Church,
Your Eminence?

404
00:30:23,476 --> 00:30:27,267
Life is so short.
I decided to opt for eternity.

405
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:32,518
Did you receive
your calling as an adult?

406
00:30:39,392 --> 00:30:42,184
No, I heard the call.

407
00:30:42,226 --> 00:30:44,518
Right here, when I was sixteen.

408
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:49,892
Right here,

409
00:30:53,642 --> 00:30:55,476
where May afternoons land.

410
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:00,226
That light spoke to me and said:

411
00:31:04,101 --> 00:31:07,850
"Be calm, Bernardo, be calm."

412
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,309
The boy had become a man.

413
00:31:13,642 --> 00:31:15,767
My mother, my father,
they were here with me.

414
00:31:16,934 --> 00:31:20,767
They looked at me, but they were
no longer themselves.

415
00:31:21,434 --> 00:31:26,184
I was no longer myself.

416
00:31:27,683 --> 00:31:30,392
"Where do afternoons land?"

417
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:36,059
the voice of conscience asked.

418
00:31:36,142 --> 00:31:38,975
"They land here", I replied.

419
00:31:42,892 --> 00:31:45,683
And the voice responded calmly,

420
00:31:47,476 --> 00:31:51,476
"Yes, it's true,

421
00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:55,725
but I will continue
to protect the boy."

422
00:31:59,226 --> 00:32:02,434
What have we forgotten?

423
00:32:10,683 --> 00:32:13,267
We have forgotten...

424
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,226
We have forgotten...

425
00:32:21,392 --> 00:32:23,599
What have we forgotten?

426
00:32:26,392 --> 00:32:28,975
We have forgotten...
We have forgotten...

427
00:32:31,142 --> 00:32:34,476
What have we forgotten?

428
00:32:38,184 --> 00:32:40,518
We have forgotten...

429
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:42,850
We have forgotten...

430
00:32:46,142 --> 00:32:47,809
What do you think, Holy Father?

431
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:04,975
I thought it was beautiful,
I thought it was full...

432
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:07,017
Did I ask your opinion,
Sister Mary?

433
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:09,683
What? No, I just thought...

434
00:33:09,725 --> 00:33:11,392
Keep quiet then.

435
00:33:11,434 --> 00:33:13,017
Your address is really beautiful,
Your Eminence.

436
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:41,767
Balanced, yes,
but a balance of love.

437
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:47,309
Which is exactly what love should
be when it is full and resolved.

438
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:52,683
I, on the other hand, have never
truly known what love is.

439
00:33:53,892 --> 00:33:58,267
I have never really lived.

440
00:33:59,392 --> 00:34:01,599
But I've come to the right place,
though:

441
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:04,559
a city state filled with lost souls
who have never really lived.

442
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:08,599
Sister Mary?

443
00:34:14,725 --> 00:34:15,642
Sister Mary preferred to dine
in her apartment this evening.

444
00:34:15,683 --> 00:34:19,559
What is it you wanted to say to me?

445
00:34:30,975 --> 00:34:33,599
What have you decided
about your address?

446
00:34:35,184 --> 00:34:38,559
I've got some very clear
ideas about it.

447
00:34:39,142 --> 00:34:42,184
Do you think you might use some of
what the Secretary of State wrote?

448
00:34:42,226 --> 00:34:47,600
No.

449
00:34:49,725 --> 00:34:51,184
It's rather weak.

450
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,725
I thought it was beautiful.
What a shame, Lenny!

451
00:34:55,142 --> 00:34:58,309
- Sister Mary.
- Yes, Lenny.

452
00:34:59,351 --> 00:35:01,934
From now on, you are to call me
Your Holiness.

453
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:07,017
As you wish, Your Holiness.

454
00:35:12,934 --> 00:35:15,142
I remembered now what it was
I wanted to say to you.

455
00:35:16,725 --> 00:35:19,518
What?

456
00:35:21,392 --> 00:35:22,725
You can let everyone know...

457
00:35:23,683 --> 00:35:26,559
that tomorrow evening,
at 9:00 p.m.,

458
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:29,600
Pope Pius XIII will appear on the
balcony of Saint Peter's Basilica

459
00:35:31,142 --> 00:35:35,559
and deliver
his first official address.

460
00:35:38,476 --> 00:35:41,309
I love you, Michael.

461
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,392
I'm so happy you asked me
to come see you.

462
00:36:12,184 --> 00:36:15,142
I couldn't wait to
talk with you, Michael,

463
00:36:19,683 --> 00:36:22,518
to thank you,

464
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:24,559
and to tell you I owe it all to you
that I've gotten this far.

465
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:29,017
You taught me about life,
you taught me about Theology.

466
00:36:30,142 --> 00:36:33,642
I was supposed to be pope.

467
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:38,725
I know.
But that was your mistake.

468
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,101
You could have refused the deal
Voiello offered you:

469
00:36:42,142 --> 00:36:44,725
to betray me in exchange
for the election.

470
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:47,226
What are you talking about?
No one ever offered me a deal.

471
00:36:47,267 --> 00:36:49,683
You liar!

472
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:51,392
But I don't expect anything from
you. You don't know how to love.

473
00:36:53,392 --> 00:36:58,599
Don't talk to me like that. Please.

474
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,059
If you think I'm gonna talk to you
differently now that you're Pope,

475
00:37:01,101 --> 00:37:03,809
let me tell you something, Lenny,
that's never going to happen.

476
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:07,351
- Never! - Don't talk to me
like that, you're hurting me.

477
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:10,059
I'm hurting you?
You ruined my life.

478
00:37:10,101 --> 00:37:13,600
You destroyed any sense
of destiny in my life.

479
00:37:15,017 --> 00:37:18,767
So I spoke with Assente.

480
00:37:24,892 --> 00:37:27,226
He confessed to being gay.

481
00:37:28,975 --> 00:37:31,392
It's unacceptable
that a homosexual heads

482
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,518
the congregation that
trains priests. He's out.

483
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:38,642
- That's nuts.
- I want you to take his place.

484
00:37:38,683 --> 00:37:41,892
We'll work together
side by side, every day.

485
00:37:41,934 --> 00:37:44,934
You can continue to mentor me,
just like you've always done.

486
00:37:46,226 --> 00:37:50,434
Are you crazy?

487
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:57,184
People will say you are
just doing a favor for a friend.

488
00:37:57,226 --> 00:38:00,642
Who have you taken me for?

489
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:03,267
Did you really think
I'd accept your charity?

490
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:05,850
Charity? I don't have the power
to make you pope, Michael.

491
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:09,683
It's not true that you don't have
the power to make me pope. You do.

492
00:38:11,184 --> 00:38:15,767
- What?
- Resign.

493
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:18,226
I'll win in the next Conclave.

494
00:38:19,518 --> 00:38:21,767
I wouldn't be so sure.

495
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:26,392
The Conclave is mysterious.

496
00:38:26,975 --> 00:38:28,975
You don't know a shit! You're
just the blue-eyed kid.

497
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:33,850
The Conclave is merely a place
where games get played.

498
00:38:33,892 --> 00:38:37,975
Games in which you
were never included.

499
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:40,267
- You're just saying
that to hurt me. - I'm saying it

500
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:42,559
because I'm the one
who invented all the games

501
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,934
that get played during Conclaves.

502
00:38:44,975 --> 00:38:46,725
If you invented them,
then why aren't you pope?

503
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:50,017
I shall soon find out.

504
00:38:51,725 --> 00:38:53,142
Things went the way they did,
Michael.

505
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,392
Please, just accept it
and accept the post as Prefect

506
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:59,017
for the Congregation
for the Clergy.

507
00:38:59,059 --> 00:39:01,599
You'll be the most powerful man
in the whole Church.

508
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,683
And Michael, help me, I'm begging
you, help me write my first speech.

509
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:09,267
- I need you.
- But I don't need you, Lenny.

510
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,642
Help me write my speech,
I need your advice.

511
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,809
I have no more advice.

512
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,683
Get out of my house, Lenny.

513
00:39:18,184 --> 00:39:20,434
Why did you have me come here,
Michael?

514
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:23,600
To remind you
that you're the Pope now.

515
00:39:24,017 --> 00:39:27,850
And you are all alone.

516
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:31,142
Just as you have always been.

517
00:39:33,392 --> 00:39:35,767
And that you're a nothing.

518
00:39:40,017 --> 00:39:42,267
Nothing!

519
00:39:43,683 --> 00:39:45,309
Your Holiness Pius XIII...

520
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:51,101
Tell me about my parents.

521
00:39:56,642 --> 00:39:58,767
Your parents left you
at the orphanage,

522
00:40:03,184 --> 00:40:05,142
saying they couldn't keep
you any more

523
00:40:05,184 --> 00:40:07,101
because they had to go to Venice.

524
00:40:07,142 --> 00:40:09,683
And you didn't ask them what
they had to do in Venice?

525
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,767
We didn't ask questions.

526
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:16,934
- What were they like?
- I don't remember, Lenny.

527
00:40:17,476 --> 00:40:20,767
I must have seen
thousands of parents

528
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:22,975
who left their children with us,
I can't remember them all.

529
00:40:23,017 --> 00:40:25,767
I remember them. At least I
remember them in my dreams.

530
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:29,392
In theory,
they might still be alive.

531
00:40:29,434 --> 00:40:31,683
Yes. They'd be just
over seventy now.

532
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:33,642
And, in theory,
they might still be in Venice.

533
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:35,600
- They could be anywhere, Lenny.
- I search everywhere,

534
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,600
I pray everywhere.

535
00:40:38,642 --> 00:40:41,017
But I don't see God.

536
00:40:42,392 --> 00:40:43,975
Because I don't see my father.
Because I don't see my mother.

537
00:40:44,892 --> 00:40:48,142
I, on the other hand,
see everything.

538
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:51,267
- What do you see?
- God's plan.

539
00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:55,434
A complex architecture
that depends on you, Your Holiness.

540
00:40:55,476 --> 00:40:59,725
Everything is so clear.

541
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:02,683
Who's in there?

542
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,309
No one.

543
00:41:20,725 --> 00:41:22,725
Go see for yourself
if you don't believe me.

544
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:25,226
All of Vatican City is yours, Holy
Father, and so is this apartment.

545
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:29,850
No one loves me,
which is why I am prepared

546
00:41:29,892 --> 00:41:33,559
for every kind of vileness,
from everyone.

547
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,434
Holy Father, I see
Christ's reflection in you.

548
00:41:46,392 --> 00:41:50,975
And in Dussolier?

549
00:41:54,017 --> 00:41:55,892
I see Christ's reflection
in him too.

550
00:41:55,934 --> 00:41:58,850
A paler reflection.

551
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,476
My dear faithful ones,
I'm sorry I'm late.

552
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:54,642
But here I am.

553
00:42:56,392 --> 00:42:58,351
Look at me.

554
00:42:59,101 --> 00:43:00,683
Only don't look at me.

555
00:43:01,226 --> 00:43:03,351
Look up. Do you see the sky?

556
00:43:03,434 --> 00:43:06,476
Do you see God?

557
00:43:08,725 --> 00:43:10,683
No?

558
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,142
No matter.

559
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:15,476
Now look at the person next to you.

560
00:43:16,642 --> 00:43:19,892
Look joyfully upon him, and
remember what Saint Augustine said:

561
00:43:19,934 --> 00:43:25,351
"If you want to see God,
you have the means to do it.

562
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,267
God is love."

563
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:35,226
Pius, Pius, Pius.

564
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:16,309
Pius, Pius, Pius.

565
00:46:59,975 --> 00:47:01,434
Not now.

566
00:47:21,184 --> 00:47:24,142
Let yourself go, Your Holiness.

567
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:31,309
And if the saint here were you,
Gutierrez?

568
00:48:42,892 --> 00:48:45,142
What have we forgotten?

569
00:48:50,226 --> 00:48:52,351
What have we forgotten?

570
00:48:59,975 --> 00:49:02,267
We have forgotten God.

571
00:49:03,351 --> 00:49:06,017
You! You have forgotten God.

572
00:49:12,267 --> 00:49:15,059
I want to be very clear with you.

573
00:49:16,142 --> 00:49:19,934
You have to be closer to God
than to each other.

574
00:49:20,518 --> 00:49:24,267
I am closer to God
than I am to you.

575
00:49:24,767 --> 00:49:28,476
You need to know that I will
never be close to you.

576
00:49:28,892 --> 00:49:33,725
Because everyone
is alone before God.

577
00:49:43,101 --> 00:49:45,642
I have nothing to say to those

578
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:49,599
who have even
the slightest doubt about God.

579
00:49:49,975 --> 00:49:53,725
All I can do is
remind them of my scorn.

580
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:56,351
And their wretchedness.

581
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:01,934
I don't have the proof
of God existence,

582
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:07,017
it is up to you
to prove that He doesn't.

583
00:50:08,434 --> 00:50:13,309
Are you capable of proving
that God does not exist?

584
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,725
If you aren't able to prove it,
then it means that God does exist.

585
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:27,476
God exists.

586
00:50:28,642 --> 00:50:31,267
And He isn't interested in us

587
00:50:31,309 --> 00:50:36,642
until we become interested in Him,
in Him exclusively.

588
00:50:37,683 --> 00:50:40,059
Do you understand what I am saying?

589
00:50:41,142 --> 00:50:43,725
Ex-clu-sive-ly!

590
00:50:44,059 --> 00:50:46,892
Twenty-four hours a day.

591
00:50:47,392 --> 00:50:50,392
Your hearts and minds filled
only with God.

592
00:50:50,434 --> 00:50:53,184
There's no room for anything else.

593
00:50:53,309 --> 00:50:56,559
No room for free will,
no room for liberty,

594
00:50:56,599 --> 00:50:59,725
no room for emancipation.

595
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:04,351
"Free yourself from God",
I've heard people say.

596
00:51:04,392 --> 00:51:07,142
"Liberate yourself from God."

597
00:51:08,226 --> 00:51:14,351
But the pain of liberation is
unbearable, sharp enough to kill.

598
00:51:16,142 --> 00:51:18,599
Without God...

599
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:22,559
you are as good as dead.

600
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:27,184
Dead, abandoned strays
wandering the streets.

601
00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:31,934
We want to look you in the face.

602
00:51:33,142 --> 00:51:35,850
You want to look me in my face?

603
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:39,767
Go see God first.

604
00:51:41,892 --> 00:51:45,725
I won't help you.
I'm not gonna show you the way.

605
00:51:45,767 --> 00:51:48,850
Search for it,

606
00:51:48,892 --> 00:51:51,101
find him...

607
00:51:53,683 --> 00:51:56,309
and when you have found God,

608
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:00,476
perhaps you will see me as well.

609
00:52:12,767 --> 00:52:16,267
Stop it! How dare you shine
a light on your Pope?

610
00:52:16,309 --> 00:52:20,017
What you are doing is more
than a simple lack of respect.

611
00:52:22,892 --> 00:52:25,017
I don't know if you deserve me.

612
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,142
I don't know.

613
00:52:30,184 --> 00:52:32,434
At this point...

614
00:52:33,642 --> 00:52:36,767
I don't know if you are worthy
of me... I don't know...

615
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,226
Help me.

616
00:53:44,392 --> 00:53:46,642
Help me...

617
00:53:46,683 --> 00:53:50,599
atone for all the wrong I'll have
to do in order to save the Church.
