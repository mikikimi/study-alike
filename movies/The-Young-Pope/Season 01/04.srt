1
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,750
Brothers and sisters!

2
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,075
Here among us is Tonino Pettola,
the Great!

3
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,500
- The stigmata!
- The stigmata!

4
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,175
You... it's you...

5
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,850
It's really you!

6
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:06,075
You all see a sheep,
but it's not a sheep!

7
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,600
This is the Madonna!

8
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,875
I see Mary!

9
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:14,000
Wicked! Sick! Sinners! Pray!

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,225
Pray to the Virgin Mary!

11
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:19,825
Mother, Mother!

12
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:22,550
The wicked long to be freed
of their wickedness!

13
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,125
The sick of their sickness!
The sinners of their sinfulness!

14
00:01:26,175 --> 00:01:29,550
I'm speaking to You.
I'm speaking to You, Mother.

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,175
Hear the prayers of your faithful
ones and get to work.

16
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:36,425
I'm asking You...

17
00:01:36,475 --> 00:01:39,100
I, the Messiah!

18
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,225
The poor Tonino!

19
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,325
Give us strength!

20
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,175
Enough!

21
00:03:23,175 --> 00:03:27,675
Corpus Domini nostri Jesu Christi
custodiat animam tuam

22
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:30,175
in vitam aeternam, amen.

23
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,800
Why were you crying?

24
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,875
My sister is dying.

25
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:46,350
- Where is your sister?
- At home, in Sri Lanka.

26
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,475
What's wrong with her?

27
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:48,600
She's dying.

28
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,675
- Have you gone to see her?
- I don't have the courage.

29
00:03:50,725 --> 00:03:53,950
- Why did you become a nun?
- I met the Lord.

30
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:56,825
- Where?
- In a bar.

31
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,625
I was poor.

32
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:02,675
A drunk German came up to me
and said, "God helps the poor".

33
00:04:03,725 --> 00:04:07,800
- Are you strong?
- I do my best. But I'm little.

34
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,225
You must be strong, for your sister.

35
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:12,800
- I shall be.
- And pray till you can't pray any more.

36
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,075
- I always do.
- And if your sister were to die,

37
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,150
would you go to Sri Lanka
for the funeral?

38
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
- No.
- Why not?

39
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,375
Because when I go home,

40
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:23,950
I'm overcome
with such terrible memories

41
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,025
that I end up
doubting whether God exists.

42
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:31,475
And I don't want
to doubt whether God exists.

43
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,550
You're not the only one who doubts.

44
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,450
- Excuse me?
- I said I understand.

45
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,675
All right, that's enough.

46
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,625
Why does sin bring more sin?

47
00:04:47,675 --> 00:04:52,350
When will you halt my treacherous
and vindictive hand, Lord Jesus?

48
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,900
Or is it You...

49
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:01,200
who is gently moving my hand
for the sake of the church?

50
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,950
I beg you, don't let me
die with this anguish, Lord.

51
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,300
Eminence.

52
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:10,000
She's here.

53
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,600
Would Young Esther like an espresso?

54
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,575
Are you sure?

55
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,300
I even arranged
to buy some cane sugar.

56
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,800
I know that you young people
go crazy over cane sugar.

57
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,250
Let's come to the point, Estherina.

58
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,625
First of all, you should stay calm

59
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:47,575
and rest assured that we only
want what's best for you.

60
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,000
We are your friends.

61
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,625
Now, I've come upon this report,

62
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:56,750
of which only the people
in this room are aware,

63
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,075
I'm pleased to tell you,

64
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:03,325
that you had an extramarital
relationship with Valente,

65
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,450
the Pope's assistant.

66
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,175
You understand without being told
that this is an awkward matter.

67
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:14,925
Because of the rank
of the people involved.

68
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,550
Because of the fear of gossip.

69
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,550
Because of how badly this
might disappoint the Pope.

70
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,550
Because of the terrible
repercussions that might ensue

71
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,050
if news of this matter
were to get out.

72
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,550
Shouting, dramatic scenes,
transfers, firings.

73
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,050
And of course it's especially
embarrassing in moral terms:

74
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:46,050
Catholics united in holy matrimony

75
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,800
swear to be faithful
to their spouses.

76
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,925
You have sinned, Esther.

77
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,800
We know and we understand that
this was a moment of weakness.

78
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,325
It happens.

79
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:04,875
As a boy, whenever Napoli,
my favourite soccer team,

80
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:08,675
was in serious trouble,
don't you think I found myself

81
00:07:08,725 --> 00:07:12,475
being a little sympathetic
toward Avellino?

82
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,625
Yes, I did.

83
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:19,375
In your sin we don't detect
the marks of unbridled lust,

84
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:21,350
but the fact remains

85
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,675
that the act you committed
was gravely wrong.

86
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,050
Very gravely wrong.

87
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:49,175
Fine. Now I'm ready to guarantee

88
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:53,425
that not a word
of that disagreeable episode

89
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:55,800
will ever leave this room.

90
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,100
And what do you guarantee me
in return?

91
00:08:08,225 --> 00:08:09,950
Don't worry.

92
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,875
It's me...

93
00:08:13,475 --> 00:08:14,925
Voiello.

94
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,875
Why does sin bring sorrow?

95
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:27,275
Why does sin bring starvation?

96
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,225
Why does sin bring arrogance?

97
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,275
Why does sin bring coercion?

98
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,325
You remind me of my first
and only girlfriend, Esther.

99
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,500
Only you're much prettier.

100
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:52,900
One should never be ashamed
nor proud of one's beauty.

101
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,725
Because God asks us
to rejoice in it.

102
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:03,375
Do you rejoice in your beauty?

103
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,375
I'll bet that you don't let
your husband do it either.

104
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,825
I think that's a mistake.

105
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:16,175
The punishment of God
is never over beauty. Never.

106
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,750
Now tell me what your problem is.

107
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:29,375
Then I'll do it for you.

108
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,550
Esther is a fervent
Roman Catholic woman,

109
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,800
who is happily married
to Peter and childless.

110
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,000
She enjoys spending
her mornings roller skating

111
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,875
with the children
of the other Swiss Guards.

112
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,000
But it's not roller skating
that Esther loves.

113
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,325
She loves what she cannot have.

114
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,375
You ask me what my problem is,

115
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
but you already know
because you are so profound.

116
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,475
I'm not profound, I'm presumptuous.

117
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,800
What matters is that
you talk about your problem.

118
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,875
Yes, Holy Father, I'm sterile.

119
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,675
And Peter is sterile, too.

120
00:10:14,975 --> 00:10:18,000
I'd like to listen
to a child's voice.

121
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,450
Pray to Mary, our Mother of
miracles, who intercedes for us.

122
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,250
She knows what to do.

123
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,025
Pray to Mary,

124
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:39,575
our Mother of miracles,

125
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,425
who intercedes for us.

126
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,725
She knows what to do.

127
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,150
You're a phenomenal lip-reader,
Amatucci. Just phenomenal.

128
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,350
My sister is dead, Holy Father.

129
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,600
Let us pray for her.

130
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,800
I'd like to go to Sri Lanka
for her funeral.

131
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,225
Don't go chasing the dead, Suree,

132
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:29,750
or else the dead
will chase after you.

133
00:11:38,225 --> 00:11:39,350
Elena.

134
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,375
She takes after you.

135
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:47,175
- Vis baptizare...
- Elena.

136
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,750
Elena, ego te baptizo

137
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,650
in nomine Patris,

138
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,675
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

139
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,100
Allegra.

140
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:08,950
She takes after you.

141
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,300
Ego te baptizo in nomine Patris,

142
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,500
et Filii,

143
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,925
et Spiritus Sancti.

144
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,475
Aida.

145
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:29,725
She takes after you.

146
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,175
Yes, it's perfectly clear
she is been adopted,

147
00:12:36,225 --> 00:12:37,875
but this doesn't change the things.

148
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,125
She still takes after you.

149
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:52,125
Carolus.

150
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,075
Holy Father, I beg your pardon,

151
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,750
I really had no idea
I was in the men's bathroom.

152
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:05,425
Actually, this is neither
the men's bathroom nor the women's.

153
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:08,600
- This is the Pope's bathroom.
- I'm so sorry.

154
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,125
Do you mind if I finish
applying my lipstick?

155
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:16,000
Even if I did mind,

156
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:20,200
a woman like yourself would find
a way to go on applying it anyway.

157
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,925
So please, go right ahead.

158
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:24,725
You know women, Holy Father!

159
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,300
That's a reckless statement,
signora.

160
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,625
Come take a look.

161
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:54,825
- He's Lorenzo Insigne.
- Insigne.

162
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,500
Who is that man who has caught
the interest of half the Curia?

163
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,575
The personal assistant to
the Prime Minister of Greenland.

164
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,725
- Is he gay?
- Openly so.

165
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,150
And that woman
is the Prime Minister?

166
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,175
- Hamsik, with the mohawk.
- That's right.

167
00:14:13,225 --> 00:14:17,125
And she has an audience with you,
Holy Father.

168
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,825
Doesn't that strike you as odd?

169
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,300
What, Your Holiness?

170
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,375
After all, wouldn't etiquette
require that we entertain

171
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:28,950
the Prime Minister,
not her assistant?

172
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,375
The Cardinal Secretary of State
is entertaining her.

173
00:14:32,425 --> 00:14:35,300
What about the fact that
such a sizable group of men

174
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,500
have eyes only for a handsome man,

175
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:42,175
and pay no attention to such
stunning feminine beauty?

176
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:48,225
Holy Father, I know exactly
how to answer that question.

177
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,425
How?

178
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,750
With the silence.

179
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,300
Why?

180
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,550
Because you should never stick your
nose into other people's business.

181
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,800
Especially not in the Vatican.

182
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,800
The Prime Minister of Greenland
is waiting for you.

183
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:26,625
I know.

184
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,425
I'm incredibly handsome,

185
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:32,800
but please, let's try
to forget about that.

186
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,475
What have you brought for me?

187
00:15:36,525 --> 00:15:40,425
The best our Country has to offer,
Holy Father.

188
00:15:40,475 --> 00:15:45,175
This is the largest halibut caught
in all of Greenland last week.

189
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:51,225
This is very good poached in
a light broth, just like pezzogna.

190
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:53,500
- Pezzogna?
- Sea bass.

191
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,700
And this is a beautiful song
by an Italian singer

192
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,050
who is pretty popular
in our country.

193
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,150
She is called Nada and the song
is entitled "Senza un perché".

194
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,000
Thank you.

195
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,175
This is from me, for you.

196
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,300
Thank you, Holy Father.
It's wonderful.

197
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,425
Holy Father, first of all,
I bring you the greetings

198
00:16:22,475 --> 00:16:24,925
of the Catholic community of Nuuk,
in Greenland.

199
00:16:24,975 --> 00:16:27,300
Yes, I know all about Nuuk.

200
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,450
It's a small Catholic community
that you have, in Greenland.

201
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,275
- Am I right?
- Yes, you are.

202
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,850
The predominant Faith in Greenland
is Evangelical Lutheran.

203
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,025
And you have a female bishop,
if I'm not wrong.

204
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:45,050
Exactly. Sofia Petersen,
an estimable woman.

205
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:48,075
All bishops are estimable.

206
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,925
Did you know that Pope Pasquale II

207
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:54,000
appointed the first bishop
to Greenland?

208
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,575
A place that, as you know very well,

209
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,950
is technically part
of North America,

210
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,375
four full centuries
before Christopher Columbus?

211
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,700
I do know that, Holy Father.

212
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,275
The Catholic Church was the first
to arrive in Greenland.

213
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:12,350
But it's not always the case that
the first to arrive remains first.

214
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,700
I agree, Holy Father.

215
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,925
In Greenland, we Catholics
are like the native Americans.

216
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:23,475
We got there first and then
we were confined to reservations.

217
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,125
I agree, Holy Father.

218
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:30,225
You are a woman who tends to agree.

219
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,925
Don't worry,
Madame Prime Minister.

220
00:17:35,975 --> 00:17:39,675
I'm not asking you for anything for
our small community in Greenland.

221
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:43,800
I just wanted to remind you
that we Catholics were there first.

222
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,450
Everyone else is a guest.

223
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,750
I don't want you to forget that.

224
00:17:49,475 --> 00:17:52,000
- I won't, Holy Father.
- Very good!

225
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,675
Now, I ask you, please satisfy
my morbid curiosity:

226
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,800
since your country never thaws,

227
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,800
I have to wonder,
what's under all that ice?

228
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,800
The experts believe
that Greenland is not an island,

229
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,000
but an archipelago of islands.

230
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,825
But that's strictly
a matter of supposition.

231
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,250
the country never thaws

232
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,525
and no one can see
what's under there.

233
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:25,800
I think the experts are wrong.

234
00:18:26,475 --> 00:18:29,350
- Really, Holy Father?
- Yes.

235
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,500
Under all that ice could be God.

236
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:16,550
...gratia plena, Dominus tecum,

237
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,825
benedicta Tu in mulieribus,

238
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:24,075
et benedictus
fructus ventris Tui, Jesus.

239
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,450
Sancta Maria, Mater Dei,

240
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
ora pro nobis peccatoribus,

241
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,750
nunc et in hora mortis nostrae.

242
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,500
Amen.

243
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:37,975
Ave Maria, gratia plena,
Dominus tecum,

244
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,325
benedicta Tu in mulieribus,

245
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:45,925
et benedictus fructus ventris Tui,
Jesus.

246
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:51,925
Sancta Maria, Mater Dei,
ora pro nobis peccatoribus,

247
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,325
nunc et in hora mortis nostrae.

248
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,050
Amen.

249
00:22:16,475 --> 00:22:18,425
Holy Father...

250
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,375
Would you teach me to pray?

251
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
Start praying aloud.

252
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,050
Let me see how you do it.

253
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,675
Blessed Virgin Mary,

254
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,875
give me the grace
of becoming pregnant.

255
00:22:56,925 --> 00:23:01,475
Prayer shouldn't be
a list of requests, Esther.

256
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:05,825
It should be an occasion
for understanding.

257
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:09,125
While we pray, we reflect...

258
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,375
in the most elevated way we can,

259
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:16,425
so that someone can whisper
thoughts into our ears.

260
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,925
We call that someone God.

261
00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:23,250
Or, in the present case,
the Madonna of Lourdes.

262
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:28,625
All right. Then let me try again.

263
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,675
Blessed Virgin Mary,

264
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,675
God does not punish beauty,

265
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:42,375
as a person who is very dear
to You once told me.

266
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:47,550
That phrase opened my eyes.

267
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,600
And it made me understand
that perhaps,

268
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,625
by making a gift of beauty,

269
00:23:54,675 --> 00:23:58,075
I might perhaps receive
some in return.

270
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:01,675
And what if making a gift
of my beauty meant

271
00:24:01,725 --> 00:24:05,425
receiving the beauty
that I so desire?

272
00:24:05,475 --> 00:24:09,550
The beauty of a new life,
of a little child?

273
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:13,925
Yes, now you're praying.

274
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,500
What if it was
an intolerable burden to me

275
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,075
to donate my beauty to the person
I promised to love

276
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,800
in sickness and in health?

277
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:27,125
What if I wanted to donate
my beauty somewhere else?

278
00:24:30,725 --> 00:24:32,050
If you were to give
your beauty elsewhere,

279
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,550
you would not receive
the beauty of a new life,

280
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,925
but only sorrow...

281
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,625
and the unbearable burden of guilt.

282
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,825
You know, Esther,

283
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:50,550
Spinoza set us the most daunting
challenge of them all.

284
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:59,500
"He that loves God does not demand
that God should love us in return".

285
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,425
I don't understand.

286
00:25:04,475 --> 00:25:05,850
I know.

287
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,200
But in time you will.

288
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,500
Holy Father,

289
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:17,475
the truth is I know to whom
I'd like to donate my beauty.

290
00:25:19,675 --> 00:25:21,950
- I'd like...
- Now, Esther,

291
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
continue to pray in your head.

292
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:30,800
There are certain secrets
you must share only with God.

293
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:05,175
Stop crying, Suree!

294
00:26:05,225 --> 00:26:07,250
That's enough!

295
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,100
Believers don't cry!

296
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,350
That's not right!

297
00:26:13,475 --> 00:26:17,350
It's time we stop crying
at funerals.

298
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,025
You don't believe.

299
00:26:27,225 --> 00:26:29,550
Suree, you don't believe.

300
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:36,000
Holy Father, I brought you a gift

301
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,825
to improve
our relationship a little.

302
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:41,200
Thanks.

303
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:48,950
These are supposed to be worse
than real cigarettes.

304
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,150
I was told that
they're good for you.

305
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,000
It doesn't matter.

306
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,700
It's a substitute
for the real thing.

307
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:59,250
What I want, always,
is the whole truth.

308
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,175
Then you've come to the wrong place.

309
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:04,700
Holy Father,
don't call me repetitive,

310
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,175
but when is your speech to
the cardinals going to take place?

311
00:27:08,225 --> 00:27:10,575
- In due time.
- Yes, but when?

312
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:13,425
You really don't understand, do you?

313
00:27:13,475 --> 00:27:15,625
What am I supposed to understand?

314
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,875
- That I'm creating.
- What are you creating?

315
00:27:18,925 --> 00:27:21,150
Anticipation.

316
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,075
Holy Father, shall we look
into the Kurtwell case a little?

317
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,125
Your Eminence, the answer is yes.

318
00:27:27,175 --> 00:27:30,075
I want to look
into the Kurtwell case,

319
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:33,425
but from a broader point of view.

320
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:37,325
The individual case is always
an indicator of a larger issue.

321
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:41,150
I agree. Let's pursue
all the cases of pedophilia

322
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,375
that are infesting our Church.

323
00:27:42,425 --> 00:27:43,825
Let's widen the circle.

324
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:46,950
Let's prosecute all the cases
of homosexuality

325
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,175
that are infesting our Church.

326
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:53,625
Let's root out all the homosexuals
and expel them,

327
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:57,375
and prevent any new gay priests
from entering our Church.

328
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:01,800
Let's do it for real, without
exceptions and without hypocrisy.

329
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,450
Holy Father, pedophilia
and homosexuality

330
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,800
are two very different things.

331
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,700
Two very different things
that are both equally unacceptable

332
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,175
to the Catholic Church.

333
00:28:11,225 --> 00:28:16,500
It would be a war that would leave
the ground littered with corpses.

334
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:20,175
Do you want to know how many
corpses would litter the ground?

335
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:21,925
Two thirds of the Clergy.

336
00:28:21,975 --> 00:28:27,500
Then what becomes of Mother
Church's capacity for forgiveness?

337
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:32,350
Our abuse of forgiveness
we've become a laughingstock.

338
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:36,500
As unreliable as some miserable
little third-world country.

339
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,325
With your methods,
on the other hand,

340
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:44,475
we're likely to become
as reliable as, say, North Korea.

341
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:47,050
No.

342
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,000
And do you wanna know
what the difference is?

343
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,875
We don't imprison ours,
we set them free.

344
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:56,450
We pardon every one of them,

345
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,075
but one second later
we kick them out the door.

346
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:03,500
All right, Holy Father,
as you command.

347
00:29:05,725 --> 00:29:08,050
I have a question for you.

348
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,500
Holy Father, I have a great
many shortcomings,

349
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:16,950
but there can be no doubt
about my heterosexuality.

350
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,500
Even if I can't bring you
any direct testimony on the matter.

351
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,000
- That wasn't the question.
- Sorry.

352
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,200
What was the question?

353
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,625
Would you tell me
about your calling?

354
00:29:28,675 --> 00:29:31,675
Holy Father,
I'll tell you the truth.

355
00:29:31,725 --> 00:29:35,575
If you expect me to tell you
a tale of blinding illuminations

356
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:39,600
or dazzling conversions,
you're going to be disappointed.

357
00:29:40,225 --> 00:29:43,300
Quite simply,
I had a predisposition.

358
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,950
A predisposition to become a priest,

359
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,600
the way others have one to become
a painter or a cricket player.

360
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:54,600
What about you, Your Holiness?

361
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,375
It's for you.

362
00:30:34,425 --> 00:30:36,375
Holy Christ!

363
00:30:38,975 --> 00:30:40,425
If only I were!

364
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,800
- How did you get in here?
- With a duplicate of your keys.

365
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:49,700
Now what do you want?

366
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,700
Everything you were supposed to do
but haven't done yet.

367
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,900
I've tried.

368
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,750
But it's impossible.

369
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,800
That gentleman is the Pope,
he's the man of the greatest virtue

370
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,800
and rectitude on the planet,

371
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,125
and I've never been much
of a seductress myself.

372
00:31:05,175 --> 00:31:07,450
Neither was the Virgin Mary.

373
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,875
But that didn't keep her
from becoming...

374
00:31:10,925 --> 00:31:14,300
the most attractive
and desired woman on earth.

375
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:18,250
But I'm just a good Catholic girl.

376
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,450
Good Catholic girls,
especially the married ones,

377
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,375
don't cheat on their husbands.

378
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,825
But I didn't come here
to threaten you,

379
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:31,425
nor to remind you of your sins.

380
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:34,875
You are an intelligent woman
and you should know.

381
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:37,550
What should I know?

382
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:42,900
That you're beautiful,
you're attractive,

383
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:46,175
and the Pope has
a particular interest in you.

384
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,700
He only cares about my sorrow.

385
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,625
Peter and I can't have children.

386
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:53,425
That's not the way it is.

387
00:31:53,475 --> 00:31:58,000
What I'm about to tell you
is confidential, eternally so:

388
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,125
Esther, the Holy Father's faith

389
00:32:03,175 --> 00:32:06,600
isn't as solid as we like to think.

390
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:08,575
What are you saying?

391
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:13,575
I insist. Moreover,
he's had dozens of girlfriends.

392
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:16,250
He's a loose man.

393
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,450
Your job is
to seduce the Holy Father.

394
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,300
We will take care
of everything else.

395
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,800
I wouldn't know how to go about it.

396
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And I don't want
to wind up tangled...

397
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,700
in a public scandal
that would ruin my life.

398
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,425
Silly girl... There won't be
any public scandal.

399
00:32:38,975 --> 00:32:43,500
All that's needed is the threat
of scandal to turn things around.

400
00:32:44,225 --> 00:32:45,575
What things?

401
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:48,700
The Holy Father intends
to issue new measures

402
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:53,350
that could lead irreversibly
to the extinction of the Church.

403
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,550
Do you understand what significant
stakes we're talking about?

404
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,875
Me, you, all of us

405
00:32:59,925 --> 00:33:04,175
have the sacrosanct duty
to stop him, in God's name.

406
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,225
But I could try to talk to him.
He respects me.

407
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,800
Sorry, I was about to laugh,

408
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:21,675
but I stopped myself,
because I have a certain class.

409
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:28,000
We seriously doubt that Pius XIII
even respects God.

410
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:31,675
You don't know him at all.

411
00:33:31,725 --> 00:33:33,675
He's an extraordinary person.

412
00:33:36,425 --> 00:33:39,500
That's why you are so seductive,
Esther.

413
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,500
Because you don't know a thing.

414
00:33:43,225 --> 00:33:45,550
Now, go and seduce him.

415
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:52,000
I don't want to sin anymore.

416
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,575
If only that were possible, Esther.

417
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:56,100
If only!

418
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,750
Friends, good evening!

419
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,175
Today we are here with a very
very special guest.

420
00:34:10,225 --> 00:34:12,950
Let's start from the beginning.
What's your name?

421
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,800
- Tonino Pettola.
- Tonino, what kind of work do you do?

422
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,950
I'm a shepherd. I herd sheep.

423
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,175
So, a flock.

424
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,950
You need to know that Tonino
Pettola has a flock of sheep,

425
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,900
and a few years ago
he started to see the Madonna.

426
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:31,075
- Right, Tonino?
- Yes.

427
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:32,925
When did you have your first vision?

428
00:34:32,975 --> 00:34:36,875
The day I got... the stigmata!

429
00:34:36,925 --> 00:34:38,900
The stigmata!

430
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:42,250
Unbelievable!
Tonino, show us your stigmata.

431
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,925
No... ok, ok, thanks!

432
00:34:45,975 --> 00:34:47,450
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's incredible.

433
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,250
This is truly amazing!

434
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,750
I'm close to him, and I assure you,
these are genuine stigmata!

435
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,550
Tonino, please tell us
about this vision.

436
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,950
In the middle of my flock, a young
woman appeared, full of light.

437
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,175
- Yes.
- It was Mary.

438
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:07,250
It was the Madonna.

439
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,925
And the Madonna spoke
to you, Tonino, right?

440
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:13,500
- What did She say? Yes.
- She said: "Tonino"...

441
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:17,700
"You are a descendant of Mine
and also of Padre Pio.

442
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,425
You have the Light.

443
00:35:19,475 --> 00:35:23,350
You have the power to see Me,
and to heal the sick.

444
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,550
You have..."

445
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,075
In any case, my friends,
let me say that...

446
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:35,450
Tonino Pettola lives
here in Montecruccoli,

447
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,250
and for the past two years,
since he began having visions,

448
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,950
thousands of faithful have come
from all over Europe, right?

449
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,875
Just to see him,
to meet him, to touch him,

450
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:49,125
to ask him for a miracle.

451
00:35:49,175 --> 00:35:52,200
Tonino, you've already done
some healings, right?

452
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,100
- Yes.
- After six months the healings began.

453
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,425
- The Madonna...
- Yes...

454
00:35:58,475 --> 00:35:59,750
listens to Tonino...

455
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,825
particularly in regard
to cardiovascular diseases

456
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:06,050
- and meniscus problems.
- Useful!

457
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:10,300
In fact, a lot of athletes have
come here to Montecruccoli.

458
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,425
- Pallotta, the soccer star...
- Yes, we say hello to him!

459
00:36:12,475 --> 00:36:16,875
expected to be benched for 6 months
with torn ligaments, but

460
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:19,625
after Tonino touched him,
he recovered.

461
00:36:19,675 --> 00:36:21,050
The following Sunday
he was back on the field.

462
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,700
He even scored a double.

463
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,875
With his right foot,
which is not his good one.

464
00:36:24,925 --> 00:36:29,175
Incredible.
This story is incredible!

465
00:36:29,225 --> 00:36:34,000
You should know that Tonino
receives only 100 people at a time.

466
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,800
Otherwise, he says,
the miracles won't happen.

467
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,500
- Isn't that right, Tonino?
- Yes, that's right.

468
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,375
And I'd like to say that
we don't ask for money.

469
00:36:41,425 --> 00:36:44,450
- No, no, no.
- And there's nothing illegal here.

470
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,450
I have a gift,

471
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,375
and I want to put it to use
to serve the needy.

472
00:36:51,425 --> 00:36:53,500
And that's really beautiful...

473
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:58,725
We know that something
is bothering you.

474
00:37:00,925 --> 00:37:03,075
Tonino is heartbroken.
Tonino is heartbroken

475
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:08,500
because unfortunately the Church
refuses to recognize his abilities.

476
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:12,300
And this pains you.

477
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:16,700
But today we'd like to put
our show at your disposal,

478
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,000
which, as you know, is very popular,

479
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:22,450
to speak directly to the cardinals
who are listening.

480
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,550
And why not? Maybe even to the Pope!

481
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,300
Because maybe
the Pope is watching us too!

482
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:30,050
Tonino, what do you want to say
to the Pope?

483
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,000
- There?
- Yes there!

484
00:37:36,175 --> 00:37:38,550
Holy Father...

485
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,950
why won't you believe me?

486
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,575
We sent you... all the documents,

487
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:48,375
but you returned them unopened.

488
00:37:48,425 --> 00:37:50,500
I am real.

489
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,625
I'm not lying.

490
00:37:52,675 --> 00:37:54,325
I am so devoted,

491
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:58,925
so in love with God, that
the Madonna answered my prayers.

492
00:37:58,975 --> 00:38:01,100
And she appeared to me.

493
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,000
I don't want money.

494
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:09,000
I just want you to say
that I am one of you.

495
00:38:10,075 --> 00:38:13,175
I don't want to found
a Church of my own.

496
00:38:14,675 --> 00:38:19,550
But if you in Rome
continue to call me a fraud,

497
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:25,600
then I'll be forced to found
a church of my own.

498
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:32,050
They all want it... all the
faithful flocking here to see me.

499
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:36,950
What should I do, Holy Father?

500
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,300
Please tell me.

501
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,800
Please tell me.

502
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,125
If he perhaps wants to tell me.

503
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,750
Jump.

504
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:19,100
Jump.

505
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,875
Something odd has been happening
in the last few hours.

506
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,100
Let's hear it.

507
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:40,600
During confession,
for reasons that escape me,

508
00:39:42,475 --> 00:39:44,825
people have suddenly started

509
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:48,900
recounting their exploits
with women,

510
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,550
offering up the most intimate,
embarrassing details.

511
00:39:57,925 --> 00:40:00,300
Strange, isn't it?

512
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:05,550
Someone must be spreading
a rumor that the Pope

513
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,325
is out to punish the homosexuals.

514
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:13,025
Yes, the famous calumnies

515
00:40:13,075 --> 00:40:16,000
of our little State.

516
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,900
What if they weren't calumnies?

517
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:26,875
"I don't want to sin anymore",
Ester said through her tears.

518
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,050
I've heard more people say that
than anything else in my life.

519
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,300
And they all believe what they say.

520
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,100
She also believed what she said.

521
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,800
Poor girl.

522
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,075
She doesn't know that
up to the very last day

523
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:47,625
that we are able to think,

524
00:40:47,675 --> 00:40:49,925
we are condemned to go on sinning.

525
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,375
That's why I need you, Girolamo.

526
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,550
You are my oasis.

527
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,550
You are my salvation.

528
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:09,425
You, Girolamo, are the only soul
in the world without sin.

529
00:41:12,925 --> 00:41:17,550
Only you, Girolamo, can truly
touch the hem of holiness.

530
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,550
You, who do not know...
and will never know

531
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,925
what it means to live inside
a wrong life every single day.

532
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,550
Forgive me.

533
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,625
Forgive me if you can, Girolamo.

534
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,000
Goodnight, Don Tommaso.

535
00:42:13,925 --> 00:42:15,750
Goodnight, Holy Father.

536
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:31,725
Let's go in the bedroom.

537
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,450
No.

538
00:42:51,675 --> 00:42:52,975
Where?

539
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,000
Here.

540
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:00,550
All right.

541
00:44:39,925 --> 00:44:43,050
Virgin Mary, Mother of God,

542
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:47,550
Peter's successor has
a specific grace to ask of You.

543
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,825
Now, right now, those two young
people in their home,

544
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:52,550
Peter and Esther,
have only one wish.

545
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,875
You must grant it to them.

546
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:58,600
You must.

547
00:44:59,425 --> 00:45:00,975
You must.

548
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:05,175
You must. You must.

549
00:45:05,225 --> 00:45:07,200
You must.

550
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,875
You must. You must!

551
00:45:10,525 --> 00:45:11,950
You must.

552
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,400
You must, must.

553
00:45:15,225 --> 00:45:18,250
You must. You must.

554
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,675
You must.

555
00:45:21,725 --> 00:45:24,350
You must, please.

556
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,925
You must.

557
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:38,225
Amen.

558
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:23,725
They're taking their afternoon nap.

559
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,850
The fat one is snoring.

560
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,375
Yes, she is Mother Letizia.

561
00:46:34,175 --> 00:46:36,150
She's the metronome of sleep.

562
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:42,250
I've made an important decision.

563
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,800
What?

564
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:47,675
You will go to New York
to investigate the Kurtwell case.

565
00:46:47,725 --> 00:46:50,025
Why do you want to punish me,
Holy Father?

566
00:46:50,075 --> 00:46:53,825
This is no punishment,
this is a promotion.

567
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:55,500
I trust you.

568
00:46:56,725 --> 00:46:58,750
Holy Father, spare me.

569
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,300
I'm a modest, limited man,
believe me.

570
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:07,900
The Kurtwell case is something far
too big for me, beyond my scope.

571
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,475
Quit selling yourself short.
You're going to New York.

572
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:15,250
You'll investigate.

573
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,900
You'll gather
the necessary evidence,

574
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:19,875
and you'll put Kurtwell
into my hands.

575
00:47:19,925 --> 00:47:22,850
My Papacy won't let the harm done
to even a single child

576
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,150
slip away into indifference.

577
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,000
And you will help me,
because I trust you.

578
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,450
Blindly!

579
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:35,000
Holy Father, I am a recluse.

580
00:47:36,425 --> 00:47:39,450
I only know how to live
inside these walls.

581
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,850
In all these years,
I've left here only twice,

582
00:47:43,425 --> 00:47:45,475
both times to go to the hospital.

583
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:48,250
I don't know
how to cross the street,

584
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,000
I don't know
how to get a hotel room,

585
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:53,500
I don't know how to order
a meal in a restaurant.

586
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:55,825
I'm like those canaries in cages.

587
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:58,850
If you free them, they die.

588
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:02,200
You're afraid.

589
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:07,400
I was afraid too before I accepted
my destiny as head of the Church.

590
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,925
How do you overcome fear?

591
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:17,750
By giving in to the complex
and unfathomable architecture

592
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,500
that God has designed for us.

593
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:30,925
Be calm, Bernardo. Be calm.

594
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,675
The boy has become a man.

595
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:07,425
But I will continue
to protect the boy.

596
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:12,000
Where do afternoons land?

597
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,175
Where do May afternoons land?

598
00:49:18,425 --> 00:49:20,625
The boy has become a man.

599
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,375
I land here.

600
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,125
Yes. That's true.

601
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,675
But I will continue
to protect the boy.
