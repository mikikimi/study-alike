1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,250
Lazio is going deep once again...

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,200
Watch out for Lulic!

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,525
How could we let this happen?

4
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:10,575
How could we let this happen?
How could we let this happen?

5
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:15,075
Such a key game...
wasted like this!

6
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:16,525
What the hell?!

7
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:19,275
What kind of Naples' team is this?

8
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:22,250
How can you possibly play
such a crucial game this way?

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,325
We let them overtake us like this!

10
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,900
For the second time!

11
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,700
How could we let this happen?

12
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:39,325
What a disappointment!

13
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,750
What a disappointment!

14
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,525
Lulic's 2-0...

15
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:48,750
Just as the first half
was about to end.

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,950
What a disappointment!

17
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:54,575
What a disappointment!

18
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,450
Leave us!

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,275
They'll destroy us.

20
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:26,875
This losing retrograde battle
against homosexuals,

21
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:30,200
especially in the glare
of that young man's suicide,

22
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,625
will put an end to everything.

23
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,575
It's possible to tolerate
a great many things

24
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:37,700
but not a threat
to one's own survival.

25
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:44,250
But you told me that you gave
those photos to Sister Mary

26
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,400
and that she had destroyed them.

27
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,750
That's true.

28
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:49,200
But first I made a copy...

29
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,750
just in case.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,050
What do you have in mind?

31
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,000
Let's give them to the press.

32
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,250
In fifteen days
we'll have a new Pope.

33
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,700
An adult Pope.

34
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,375
- Who?
- Spencer.

35
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:13,200
Or else me.

36
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,050
No.

37
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:18,375
Me.

38
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:20,950
All right.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,575
I'll pull strings in the Conclave
like always,

40
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:23,900
and you'll be the new Pope.

41
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,575
And you'll be an all-powerful
Cardinal Secretary of State again.

42
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,925
But none of that will happen.

43
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,500
We won't use those photographs.
There won't be any scandal.

44
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,850
- Why not?
- Because we can't show the world

45
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,650
the image of a Pope with his hands
on a young woman's breasts.

46
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,150
It would be the lowest point ever
for the Church,

47
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,625
that no subsequent Pope would
ever be able to recover from it.

48
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,625
You're forgetting something.

49
00:05:06,075 --> 00:05:09,550
I speak frequently with the Pope.

50
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,100
What I'm about to tell you he said
to me in conversation,

51
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,125
not in the confessional.

52
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:20,000
Which means I'm not breaking
the seal of confession.

53
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,525
What are you about to tell me?

54
00:05:21,575 --> 00:05:25,950
The Pope is going through
a profound crisis of faith.

55
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,125
What are you insinuating,
Don Tommaso?

56
00:05:30,175 --> 00:05:33,925
That the Pope
doesn't believe in God.

57
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,150
They've manifested themselves.

58
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,175
Who?

59
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:34,250
My Mom and Dad.

60
00:07:35,175 --> 00:07:37,050
But how?

61
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,400
It came in a box.
No postmark, no nothing.

62
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,575
Not a clue,
no way to track them down.

63
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,875
Why don't they wanna be
tracked down?

64
00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:54,400
Because they're afraid of you,
Your Holiness.

65
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,050
Everyone is afraid of you.

66
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,575
You've gotta cut it out
with the fear, Your Holiness.

67
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,625
The important thing
is that they're alive.

68
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:08,325
And they haven't forgotten you.

69
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:21,200
That's the Madonna of the jungle.

70
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,500
I know that.

71
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,950
Was there something you wanted
to tell me, Sister Mary?

72
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:35,675
The Pope is upset, the Pope is
experiencing a moment of weakness.

73
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,000
The Pope is distracted.

74
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,625
If you need to have him sign a
document or something of the sort

75
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:46,275
that gets our Church
back on course,

76
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:48,800
this would be the right time
to do it.

77
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,125
I've done my part.
Now you need to do yours.

78
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,275
What exactly have you done?

79
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,650
You'd better be ready, Voiello.

80
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,200
Someone might see us.

81
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,500
There is a new preface by Joseph.

82
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:35,650
I'm depressed, Angelo.

83
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,250
I don't give a shit
that you're depressed, Michael.

84
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,075
At night, I take care
of a disabled boy.

85
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,950
Last night I was looking at him,

86
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,650
he was drooling and his eyes were
blank, and I thought to myself:

87
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,500
what is the Church
doing for this boy?

88
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,375
And the answer was simple:

89
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:55,875
the Church is doing nothing.

90
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:57,075
Why?

91
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,250
What was it doing before Pius XIII?

92
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,200
Are you depressed or suffering
from amnesia, Michael?

93
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,125
Before Pius XIII the Church
was taking care of the poor.

94
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:10,150
It was "also" taking care
of the poor.

95
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,150
But there's a bigger question.

96
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,775
What is the Church doing
on a more general basis?

97
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:18,075
It's not doing anything anymore.

98
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,850
It's killing time.

99
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,325
We have a Church
that's just killing time

100
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,975
and has become infinitely marginal.

101
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:28,825
That's exactly what the Pope wants:
a marginal Church.

102
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,200
Small and dead.

103
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,275
He said it and now he's done it.

104
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:36,700
He wants to take the Church
back to its beginnings?

105
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,200
In the beginning, all this was
nothing more than Peter's tomb.

106
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,525
For what purpose?

107
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:44,875
To close himself off,
to deny himself,

108
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:48,275
to make himself inaccessible
and mysterious?

109
00:12:48,325 --> 00:12:52,050
Sacrifice and suffering
to get closer to God.

110
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:57,125
In his convoluted logic this
strategy is supposed to stimulate

111
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:59,375
the world's curiosity
and dedication,

112
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:03,500
so that everyone will want to come
back to discover the mystery.

113
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,750
Fine!
But none of this is happening.

114
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,275
The churches are empty.

115
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:14,450
The mass with the Tridentine rite
would discourage anyone.

116
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,400
It's now harder to become a priest
than it is to become an astronaut.

117
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,500
The Pope is refusing to refinance
the missions.

118
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,250
Our non-relations with other
religions are tense and dangerous.

119
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,100
We've become few in number, alone,
against the rest of the world.

120
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,850
St. Peter's Square is empty,
dreary, and abandoned.

121
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,575
Michael, we have the duty
to take steps.

122
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,750
How?

123
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,800
Michael, come see.

124
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,125
I know how to get him to resign,
Michael.

125
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,875
And who would this new Pope be?

126
00:15:28,575 --> 00:15:33,275
Forgive me, Lord, for
I have deceived, I am deceiving,

127
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:37,775
and I will continue to deceive
the Holy Father.

128
00:15:37,825 --> 00:15:40,075
Forgive me, Lord,

129
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,650
but I can no longer continue
to look on at the destruction

130
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,950
of the man I love
more than I love myself.

131
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,575
Forgive me, Lord,

132
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:54,625
for I cannot continue any longer
to look on at the destruction

133
00:15:54,675 --> 00:15:59,050
of the institution I love
more than I love myself:

134
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,950
the holy Roman Church.

135
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:31,175
- Having fun, Aldo?
- Yeah, I guess...

136
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Don't you agree it's a crime

137
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,825
that the cocktail culture
is in decline, Your Eminence?

138
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,400
Is it really such a bad thing?

139
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,000
I should say so.

140
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:18,250
My father taught me the art of the
cocktail when I was twenty-five.

141
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,750
My father was one
of the first people in Italy

142
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,375
to devote himself to the art
of the cocktail, you know.

143
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:26,225
I'm sorry.

144
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,550
Can you excuse me just a moment?

145
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,700
You're a murderer.

146
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,825
Did you come for me?

147
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:23,225
No, no, I came because

148
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:26,000
I've never felt so alone

149
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,950
and in despair in all my life.

150
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,775
Angelo Sanchez is dead.

151
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:33,650
And I wanted to die
when I first saw you.

152
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,250
I was dying of desire.

153
00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:14,450
Ludovico, we'd like to go to bed.

154
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,800
Would you do us a favor?

155
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,900
Get his crucifix
and take him back to the Vatican.

156
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,675
I'll take care of it, mom.

157
00:21:14,325 --> 00:21:18,100
- Who are you?
- Ludovico Meraviglia.

158
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,375
When will they be here?

159
00:22:49,425 --> 00:22:50,950
Soon.

160
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,550
They're clearing immigration
and passport control.

161
00:22:55,575 --> 00:23:00,550
Why don't you help the time pass
by doing a little work?

162
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,350
They're here.

163
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,125
Show them in.

164
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,750
- Did you send me a gift?
- Yes.

165
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,925
What did you send me?

166
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,300
The piece of the pipe
you were missing.

167
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:52,925
The piece I gave you
before I left you.

168
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:01,200
How did you know I lost it?

169
00:25:02,575 --> 00:25:04,150
From time to time
I'd call the orphanage

170
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,125
where you were growing up.

171
00:25:07,175 --> 00:25:10,775
And they told me that you always
kept a piece of the pipe with you,

172
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:14,050
but that you were missing
the other piece.

173
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,575
How did you find that piece?

174
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:20,875
I had already lost it after you
left me at the orphanage.

175
00:25:22,175 --> 00:25:25,875
Because one day, I was
in a shop in Venice,

176
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:29,600
and I happened to find
the same pipe so I bought it.

177
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:33,825
And I sent you the piece
of it that you had lost.

178
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,925
All right.

179
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:44,550
Now neither of you move.

180
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,650
It's not them.

181
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:36,450
Valente, expel these impostors
from my home immediately.

182
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:00,925
Who are you, Lenny?

183
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:05,200
I'm an orphan.

184
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,425
Just like you.

185
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:10,125
When you gonna grow up?

186
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,400
Never.

187
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:17,625
A priest never grows up, because
he can never become a father.

188
00:27:17,675 --> 00:27:20,275
He'll always be a son.

189
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:23,000
That is why we imposed
a vow of celibacy on ourselves

190
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,000
thirteen centuries ago,

191
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,450
because we must always be
the sons of God,

192
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,200
never dare try to take His place.

193
00:27:34,325 --> 00:27:38,075
Do you know why I wanted
to meet you up here?

194
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:41,125
No, why?

195
00:27:41,175 --> 00:27:43,600
Because this is where
that young Spaniard,

196
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,500
Angelo Sanchez, jumped from.

197
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:53,425
He wanted to be a priest
and we thwarted him.

198
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,200
I thwarted him.

199
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,425
And now he's dead.

200
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:09,925
Lucky him.

201
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:13,450
He's going to speak with God.

202
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,625
Unlike us, he's finally going
to find out the way things stand.

203
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,950
What has become of your pity?

204
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,125
Have you never experienced pity?

205
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,050
I can't take it anymore, Lenny.

206
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:39,025
I wanna go home, I wanna
go back to Honduras.

207
00:28:39,075 --> 00:28:42,700
If you give up now, now that
you're faced with the burden

208
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:46,400
of responsibility and
your own guilty conscience,

209
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,550
when will you ever grow up?

210
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,375
When?

211
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,375
Who is betraying me?

212
00:29:01,425 --> 00:29:03,200
Who is sending actors to my home,

213
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,075
palming them off
as my long-lost parents?

214
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:08,075
Who?

215
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,425
Voiello, Spencer?

216
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,250
Tell me, Tommaso.

217
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,050
No.

218
00:29:15,575 --> 00:29:18,050
"No", what?

219
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:24,075
No, I won't tell you anything else.

220
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,750
Why not?

221
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,375
Because I'm stupid, it's true,
but not that stupid.

222
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,125
Do you resent me for not having
made you a cardinal yet?

223
00:29:35,175 --> 00:29:38,700
Yes, at first I thought
that was the reason

224
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,950
I wouldn't confide in you again.

225
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,775
You'll assume the purple
at the next consistory.

226
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:48,050
It doesn't matter.

227
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,000
Because then I identified
another reason

228
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:54,700
I won't ever tell you
anything again.

229
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,100
Why?

230
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,925
You don't believe in God,
Holy Father.

231
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,925
You don't believe in God.

232
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
He pooped.

233
00:31:55,075 --> 00:31:56,975
You can give him to me,
Your Holiness.

234
00:31:57,025 --> 00:31:58,025
I'm happy to change him.

235
00:31:58,075 --> 00:32:01,625
Peter, get some rest,
I'll take care.

236
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,175
Oh, a lot of poop!

237
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:22,700
Holy Father, the other day
I was reflecting on the fact

238
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,000
that the one thing on which
we share a single view

239
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:29,075
is the management
of the Tonino Pettola case.

240
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,775
You can never be too careful.

241
00:33:36,825 --> 00:33:39,500
Are you afraid of being poisoned,
Your Holiness?

242
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,075
Among other things.

243
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:44,900
These are practices
that have fallen out of use

244
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,300
even in the Vatican, Your Holiness.

245
00:33:48,175 --> 00:33:50,350
So...

246
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,950
who organized that ridiculous
masquerade with the fake parents?

247
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,700
Not me, Your Holiness.

248
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:03,575
I'd find it offensive if you
thought I was behind that.

249
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,825
My methods
are far more sophisticated.

250
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,750
I have to give you that.

251
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,275
- Who, then?
- I don't know. Believe me.

252
00:34:13,325 --> 00:34:16,900
I wouldn't rule out the possibility
that they were

253
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:21,025
a couple of the kind of lunatics
who crawl out of the woodwork,

254
00:34:21,075 --> 00:34:24,925
and that our screeners allowed
themselves to be taken in.

255
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:30,575
Holy Father, I swear to God there
is no conspiracy against you.

256
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:34,025
Only a great deal
of sincere concern.

257
00:34:34,075 --> 00:34:36,750
What did you have me
sign the other day?

258
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,775
A simplified procedure
for ordaining new priests.

259
00:34:39,825 --> 00:34:41,950
And why did you have me sign it

260
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,025
without talking to me
about it first?

261
00:34:44,075 --> 00:34:47,325
I had the documents delivered
to you the night before.

262
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:51,450
- I assumed you had read them.
- No. That's not what happened.

263
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,325
You knew my head
would be in the clouds

264
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,825
and you had me hastily
sign those documents

265
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,950
that were completely opposed
in their intent

266
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,125
to the direction I' advocating..

267
00:35:01,175 --> 00:35:03,125
No, that's not right.

268
00:35:03,175 --> 00:35:06,400
I wanted you to sign the decree
simplifying the procedure

269
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:10,775
for ordaining new priests
because the press is attacking us.

270
00:35:10,825 --> 00:35:12,625
They're calling us murderers.

271
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:17,875
That with our shortsightedness,
we killed young Angelo Sanchez.

272
00:35:21,325 --> 00:35:23,200
What do you think?

273
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,150
Did we kill him?

274
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,325
Do you want the truth?

275
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,625
Yes, I want the truth.

276
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:34,700
No, Holy Father.
We didn't kill him.

277
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,325
You killed him.

278
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,950
I couldn't bring myself to do it,
Caltanissetta.

279
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,925
I couldn't have him
sign his resignation.

280
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,500
It's time to speak the truth:

281
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:38,175
Pius XIII is a total failure.

282
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,125
I'm gonna resign, Michael.

283
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,050
It's the only thing left to do.

284
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,200
He knows.

285
00:37:33,575 --> 00:37:35,375
Do you know who I am?

286
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,250
Yes. You're Carlos Garcia.

287
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,250
And do you know what I do
for a living?

288
00:37:47,325 --> 00:37:49,775
I've heard that you're a narco.

289
00:37:49,825 --> 00:37:54,050
No, I'm not just any narco.

290
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,875
I'm the biggest narco around.

291
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:03,450
And do you know how I became
the biggest narco around?

292
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,975
By cunning?

293
00:38:07,925 --> 00:38:09,700
No.

294
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,800
By violence.

295
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,450
I understand.

296
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,325
No, you don't understand.

297
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:23,750
Violence, per se,
ought not to exist.

298
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,350
It does exist
when there is a lack of respect.

299
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,000
But there are many different ways
to disrespect.

300
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:37,700
And not all require
the use of violence.

301
00:38:39,675 --> 00:38:44,200
If you had preached in your church
against the narcos

302
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:48,950
and refused to give me communion,
I wouldn't feel disrespected,

303
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,375
you would simply have
been doing your job,

304
00:38:53,425 --> 00:38:57,825
and I wouldn't have felt obliged
to use violence against you.

305
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:03,625
But that's not what you did.

306
00:39:05,175 --> 00:39:09,075
That's what the current bishop is
doing, and he's right to do so.

307
00:39:11,075 --> 00:39:15,950
In fact, no one would dream
of laying a finger on him.

308
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,800
You however
have chosen another path

309
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:32,625
for your protests against
drug trafficking.

310
00:39:34,075 --> 00:39:35,800
You've decided to take
my wife to bed.

311
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,775
And that's not right.

312
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:40,700
That's not right because
now you're putting me

313
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,275
in the odious position
of having to decide

314
00:39:43,325 --> 00:39:46,325
whether to forgive you or not.

315
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:54,700
My profound religiosity tells me
I should forgive you,

316
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,800
but my professional working ethics

317
00:40:04,925 --> 00:40:07,625
tell me the opposite.

318
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,425
All right, Esteban, let's go.

319
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,575
Hello, Rome!

320
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,250
Greetings.

321
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,925
Thank you so much...

322
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,450
Thank you.

323
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,875
God has been evicted.

324
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,650
I'm going to hand
in my resignation.

325
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:51,150
My papacy is a failure.
Never say that again, Lenny.

326
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,000
You will be a great Pope.

327
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,575
The most beloved Pope of them all.

328
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:57,500
You've healed the sick.

329
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,250
You've made a hopelessly sterile
woman pregnant.

330
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,150
You are a saint.

331
00:42:03,425 --> 00:42:05,375
A beautiful saint.

332
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:09,750
You are the sweet Christ
come back to earth.

333
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,625
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

334
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,300
Thank you for what you did for me
the other day.

335
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:22,000
- What did I do for you?
- It was wonderful!

336
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:24,775
That was the loveliest moment
of my life,

337
00:42:24,825 --> 00:42:29,800
to believe for a fleeting instant
that I had found them again.

338
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:33,825
For just one moment,
I felt like I'd come home.
