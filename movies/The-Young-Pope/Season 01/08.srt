1
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,150
Lord Almighty,

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,200
now that You have our beloved
Dussolier in Your arms,

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,600
I pray to You,

4
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,150
remind him of that afternoon

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,725
when we ran away together
from the orphanage.

6
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:28,700
Remind him of the fear and freedom
we felt on that rainy afternoon.

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,825
And reassure him,
there's nothing wrong,

8
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:35,150
freedom and fear
are always together,

9
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:40,200
like an old married couple,
each willing to die for the other.

10
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:46,125
Remind him of Sister Mary
at age twenty,

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,450
her hair flowing and blonde

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,225
and drenched in sunlight
as she ran and sank baskets.

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,700
Remind him of that indelible,
archaic picture of beauty

14
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,650
that so stirred us, in silence.

15
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,400
Now I know very well

16
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,700
that neither he nor I
will ever forget that picture.

17
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:10,075
Remind him, Lord Almighty,
of all our endless

18
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:14,450
late-night conversations,
in that big one-room dormitory,

19
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:16,975
under the blankets,

20
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:20,025
how we whispered in secret
about our one and only,

21
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:23,075
inexhaustible topic of discussion:

22
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,225
our future.

23
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:28,075
We were children then,
and that's what children do:

24
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:32,025
they paint the future in colors
that reality can never know.

25
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,075
Remind him not to grieve
over all our shattered dreams.

26
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:40,350
We wanted to live the lives
of the great baseball player,

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,075
the elderly gas station attendant
on the county road,

28
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:48,700
the heroic soldier,
the lowlife New York musician,

29
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,025
the fireman, the blue-water sailor.

30
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:54,900
Remind him not to weep

31
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,200
when he remembers that instead
we lived only the simple,

32
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,900
drab life of the priest,
such a strange life,

33
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,325
a life of hope and prayer that You,

34
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:09,325
Lord Almighty,

35
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:13,250
really do exist
and might think about us.

36
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:30,825
Amen.

37
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:07,775
Sancta Maria, Mater Dei.

38
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:02,375
Where do they go,
the airplanes we never take?

39
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,875
I always wonder the same thing,
every time I see one.

40
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,100
I always think that they go
to places I've never been.

41
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,625
They go somewhere else.

42
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,050
Tell me about the Blessed Juana.

43
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,750
She is revered in Guatemala
and across all Central America.

44
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,150
She died at the age
of eighteen and,

45
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,200
of leukemia and on her deathbed,
she said:

46
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,950
"All the world will be infatuated
with me because...

47
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,650
all my life I have been infatuated
with the world."

48
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,250
What did the Blessed Juana do
to deserve canonization?

49
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,150
Well, she cared for sick children
in the hospitals and,

50
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,525
in order to alleviate
their suffering,

51
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:34,175
she would tell them fairytales

52
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:38,150
that she thought up herself,
very amusing ones, apparently,

53
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,500
and always with the same
protagonist, the Madonna.

54
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,900
I like this, go on.

55
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:50,025
But these fairytales gave more
than a smile to the sick children.

56
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:51,325
Many of these children,

57
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,200
just a few days after listening
to Juana's fairytales,

58
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,975
recovered from terminal illnesses.

59
00:07:57,025 --> 00:08:00,975
And they recovered with a smile
on their face.

60
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:02,525
All of the cured children,

61
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:04,975
when they were asked whether
they had any idea of why

62
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:09,375
they felt better and were healed,
gave the same answer:

63
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:12,200
"The Madonna made us laugh".

64
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,450
That's a wonderful story,
Your Eminence.

65
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,200
Yes, Holy Father, it's
a wonderful story.

66
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:24,450
Beautiful...

67
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,950
if only it were true.

68
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,250
But Holy Father, it is true.

69
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:37,000
All right, let me think about it.
I'll let you know my answer soon.

70
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,450
Tell me about your calling.

71
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,275
Holy Father, the announcement
of your orders

72
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:23,325
making abortion unforgivable
has unleashed the Femen

73
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,700
and they're protesting everywhere.

74
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,825
Beneath the Eiffel Tower,
in the European parliament,

75
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,075
even in St. Peter's Square.

76
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,700
I don't want to talk
about people who strip naked

77
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,700
in order to protest
against something.

78
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,325
The death of Andrew...

79
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,200
you weren't to blame.

80
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,575
Oh, yes I was.

81
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,125
Valente.

82
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,650
Holy Father.

83
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,025
I am so tired.

84
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,200
Here I am, Holy Father.

85
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:37,775
Make yourself comfortable.

86
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,225
- Did you have a good trip?
- Oh, I just love helicopters.

87
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:46,500
They make me feel like
I'm having an adventure.

88
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,900
Young people like you
love adventures.

89
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,525
Holy Father, may I remind you
that we're the same age?

90
00:10:53,575 --> 00:10:56,450
We used to be the same age.

91
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,850
I was so surprised and happy
to hear that you wanted to see me.

92
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,000
I too was surprised to learn
that I needed to see you.

93
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,375
Oh, not wanted, but needed.

94
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,025
Weigh your words carefully,
Holy Father.

95
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,650
I'm really tired, you know that?

96
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:27,350
If you will allow me, Holy Father,
you're not tired.

97
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,525
You're grieving
and struggling with guilt

98
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:35,775
over the death of your closest
friend, Cardinal Dussolier.

99
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,500
What did you want to talk to me
about, Holy Father?

100
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,375
What are we doing wrong?

101
00:11:58,025 --> 00:12:00,150
Oh, it's very simple.

102
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,150
We've failed to follow the eternal,
unchanging principle

103
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,725
of the carrot and the stick.

104
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:07,825
The carrot and the stick.

105
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:12,250
We brought the stick
but forgot the carrot.

106
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,000
What do you mean by carrot?

107
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,325
An opening.

108
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,850
What do you mean by an opening?

109
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,575
A speech about love
and a pastoral voyage.

110
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,400
I don't like to travel
and you know perfectly well

111
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,700
that I don't like to be seen.

112
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,475
I never said that you have
to let yourself be seen.

113
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:30,950
As for traveling:
everyone dislikes traveling

114
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,825
until they actually go on a trip.

115
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,325
Then they like it, don't they?

116
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,850
Where are you thinking
of dragging me?

117
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,500
To Africa.

118
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,775
To celebrate the thirtieth
anniversary of the foundation

119
00:12:45,825 --> 00:12:48,975
of Sister Antonia's
first village of goodness.

120
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:53,100
The first of the 250 villages
of goodness.

121
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,725
The largest multinational
of charity.

122
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,775
Sister Antonia calls my office
an average of fourteen times a day

123
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:02,400
to repeat her invitation.

124
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,350
She'd gladly saw off one
of her arms to get you to come.

125
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,325
Well, you just tell her
to get to sawing,

126
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,650
and then I'll be around
sooner or later.

127
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,550
So what do you say?

128
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,825
I'm not particularly fond
of Sister Antonia and what's more,

129
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,025
several cardinals have told me

130
00:13:23,075 --> 00:13:27,025
she has a close and friendly
relationship with halitosis.

131
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:31,850
No.

132
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,225
This doesn't strike me
as the right idea

133
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:35,125
to settle the problems we have.

134
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,525
As you wish, Holy Father.

135
00:13:36,575 --> 00:13:39,825
What I really wish
is to go back to Rome.

136
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,575
I'm not a man
who's comfortable on vacation.

137
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:46,875
All intelligent men are
uncomfortable on vacation.

138
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:52,075
By the way, something that
may possibly cheer you up:

139
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,525
Elmore Coen, your favorite author,
is on vacation in Rome.

140
00:13:55,575 --> 00:13:59,350
He stated in an interview with the
press that he'd like to meet you.

141
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,325
Might that be of interest to you?

142
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,300
I've always wanted to meet
Elmore Coen.

143
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:41,125
What became...

144
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,400
of the roller-skating children?

145
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:53,775
I've loved all your books,
Mr. Coen.

146
00:15:53,825 --> 00:15:55,450
It's an immense honor for me
to meet you.

147
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,725
Let's not get ahead of ourselves,
Your Holiness.

148
00:15:57,775 --> 00:16:00,575
After all, you're the Pope.

149
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:03,975
I had heard that you wanted
to meet me too.

150
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:05,450
How could I not?!

151
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,225
You are the most mysterious man

152
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:09,525
of these first few decades
of the century.

153
00:16:09,575 --> 00:16:11,650
What writer wouldn't want
to meet you?

154
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,725
You writers are all
so obsessed with mystery.

155
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:18,900
You men of the cloth.
Don't kid around, either.

156
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:23,325
Writers and men of the cloth
are the same in that way.

157
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,400
They can't afford
to solve the mystery,

158
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,900
because the next day
they'd become irrelevant.

159
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,100
Writing is the one way I've found

160
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,400
of concealing
my boundless ignorance.

161
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,325
It's a fraud, really,

162
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,350
the way of gaining acceptance
from the world

163
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,050
and especially from women,

164
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:44,650
who are my one and only
real interest.

165
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,950
Oh, forgive me,
I've been inappropriate.

166
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,775
Not at all.

167
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,725
Laymen always think we priests
are scandalized

168
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:57,450
by even the slightest things,

169
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,200
whereas the truth
is the exact opposite.

170
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,900
We are never scandalized,

171
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:06,700
no profession has to deal with sin
on such a continual basis as ours.

172
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,325
The confessional
is our operating room.

173
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,525
Just as surgeons have
no fear of blood,

174
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:17,850
so we priests are no longer
afraid of scandal and sin.

175
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,400
So how do you survive
without women?

176
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:25,325
An easy answer.

177
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:30,025
The foolish ones
go with women on the sly.

178
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,100
The wise ones long ago understood
the degree to which sex,

179
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:39,450
as a source of pleasure,
has overvalued in our society.

180
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:45,350
Your Holiness, with a few words
you have just razed to the ground

181
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,700
three quarters
of my literary production.

182
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,100
I've almost always
written about sex

183
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,350
as the motor that drives the world.

184
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,150
And you were right. But you don't
write about motors that purr,

185
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,100
you write about motors
that break down continuously.

186
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,975
And they should have given you
a Nobel Prize for it, 20 years ago.

187
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:03,700
Ah, it's true.

188
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,600
Unfortunately, they've gotten
into the habit

189
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,550
of giving it only
to those who don't want it.

190
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,100
Have you ever had a girlfriend,
Your Holiness?

191
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,075
Certainly!

192
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,650
I've only have had one and
I remember everything about her.

193
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,500
Whereas you, Mr. Coen,
have probably had thousands

194
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,900
and don't remember
a thing about them.

195
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:26,600
I only remember certain perverse

196
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,825
and lustful details.

197
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,700
If you remember those,

198
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,075
that's probably because we're
continuing lecturing you

199
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:37,250
about how wrong it is
to remember them.

200
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,400
How do you feel?

201
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,775
Sick.

202
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,850
They've found something wrong
with me,

203
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,400
but they're not sure what it is.

204
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,950
Perhaps God has entered you.

205
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:36,000
The more than likely
it's the devil.

206
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,275
Are you going to resign?

207
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,625
No, I'm not going to resign.

208
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,075
That only makes me feel worse.

209
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,775
You're never going to be pope,
Michael. Get used to it.

210
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:57,200
I'm the Pope and I'm going to
remain pope until the day I die.

211
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,200
Because I'm curious to see
how it all turns out.

212
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,200
You don't believe in God.

213
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:12,750
- What did you say?
- I said you don't believe in God.

214
00:20:13,825 --> 00:20:17,250
I was fifty years old
myself once, you know?

215
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:20,525
I had my own crisis of faith.

216
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:23,200
Like all priests.

217
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:27,150
The second calling is
more challenging,

218
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,225
and more fraught than the first.

219
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:33,750
You no longer have to deal
with the enthusiastic of youth,

220
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,200
now you must grapple
with disenchantment

221
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,525
and the limitations
of the rational.

222
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:47,325
You don't believe in God
but that shouldn't upset you.

223
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,450
Even though you're a pope.

224
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:55,825
There's still another path
that'll allow you

225
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,100
to find the people and things
you are looking for,

226
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,200
even if you can't see it now...

227
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,525
because all you can see
before you now

228
00:21:05,575 --> 00:21:09,500
are your own doubts
and the darkness.

229
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:16,125
Please, show me this other path,
I beg you.

230
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:21,025
If I show it to you,
then the adventure is over.

231
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,975
Don't you see, Lenny?

232
00:21:24,025 --> 00:21:27,650
Your life, your Papacy,
is an unforgettable adventure?

233
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,050
You truly are my spiritual father,

234
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,650
the best a priest
could hope to have.

235
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:42,150
Michael, what must I do
to restore the Church's fate?

236
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,900
Go to Venice and bury
two empty coffins.

237
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:53,325
Gloria Patri
et Filio et Spiritui Sancto,

238
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:30,725
Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine,

239
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:34,950
Requiescant in pace.

240
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:38,050
Dominus vobiscum,

241
00:22:41,075 --> 00:22:45,850
Sit nomen Domini benedictum.

242
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,850
Adiutorium nostrum
in nomine Domini.

243
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,075
Benedicat vos ompipotens Deus:

244
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:59,075
Pater, et Filius,
et Spiritus Sanctus.

245
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:03,950
Now...

246
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,050
next Sunday...

247
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,775
we won't see each other, my dear,
devoted faithful.

248
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,575
I have to take a trip.

249
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,075
I've decided to visit Africa.

250
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:24,325
To celebrate
the thirtieth anniversary

251
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:27,100
of the foundation
of Sister Antonia's

252
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,075
first village of goodness.

253
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,650
I know!
I know you wanted him, not me.

254
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,525
- When will he come out?
- I'll tell you right away,

255
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:05,025
so you can get it out of your mind:
he's not coming out.

256
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:07,025
What does that mean:
he's not coming out?

257
00:24:07,075 --> 00:24:09,650
In that case, why are we bothering
to all travel together

258
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,950
- on the same flight?
- To feel he's closer.

259
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,300
Sofie, you know perfectly well that
this bullshit won't sell anymore.

260
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,225
Boys, what can I tell you?
He's not coming out.

261
00:24:18,275 --> 00:24:21,200
That's the official version.
Then, I, I couldn't say...

262
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,400
Anything could happen,

263
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:26,325
one thing Pius XIII certainly
doesn't lack is unpredictability.

264
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:29,575
Take this trip... in two hours
he told us: we're going.

265
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:32,400
And we put the whole thing together
at the speed of light.

266
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,175
But I'm going to ask him
a really important question.

267
00:24:34,225 --> 00:24:36,775
- Not right now, you're not.
- But why won't he come out?

268
00:24:36,825 --> 00:24:39,225
- What is he doing?
- He's praying.

269
00:24:39,275 --> 00:24:41,325
And we're praying, too:
that he'll talk to us.

270
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:43,275
We have been praying
for months now.

271
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:45,325
So what prayer is he praying?

272
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,275
My dear boy, I still can't read
the Holy Father's mind.

273
00:24:49,325 --> 00:24:51,925
Well, he's not praying aloud. With
this pope, that constitutes news.

274
00:24:51,975 --> 00:24:56,000
I have an important question
to ask him.

275
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:58,175
I understand, Jennifer,
but he's not coming out.

276
00:24:58,225 --> 00:25:00,200
Prince Abadi
has prepared the stadium

277
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,400
for the Pope's public speech.
Will he go?

278
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,100
Will he allow himself to be seen
in public for the first time?

279
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,725
He said he will. In any case,
I'll keep you informed. Ok?

280
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:12,175
Sofie, when am I'm gonna be able
to ask my question?

281
00:25:12,225 --> 00:25:14,825
I don't know, Jennifer.

282
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,725
Holy Father, reliable sources say
that the Kurtwell investigation

283
00:25:21,775 --> 00:25:23,650
is at a standstill.

284
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,650
They say that you've sent
a man with no experience

285
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,600
to conduct that investigation

286
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:32,075
because you don't actually
want to investigate.

287
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:35,900
And there's a very specific reason
for that:

288
00:25:37,775 --> 00:25:40,000
Kurtwell is blackmailing you.

289
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,125
Is that true, Holy Father?

290
00:25:44,775 --> 00:25:48,575
And what is Kurtwell
blackmailing you about?

291
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:52,325
What does Kurtwell know about you
that we don't?

292
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,100
Stay where you are! Nobody move!
Stay where you are!

293
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,525
Stay where you are!
Stay where you are! Nobody move!

294
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:35,200
Stay where you are!
Don't move!

295
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,500
Don't move! Stay where you are!

296
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,725
Eminence, what a pleasure to see
you after all these years.

297
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:14,525
The pleasure is all mine,
Mother Antonia.

298
00:28:14,575 --> 00:28:15,575
The Holy Father?

299
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:18,000
He'll get out as soon as you
hand over your phone.

300
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,775
Are you joking, Eminence?
I want a picture with the Pope.

301
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,975
We're not joking, and there won't
be any picture with the Pope.

302
00:28:23,025 --> 00:28:24,200
So what shall we do?

303
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,450
Do you think I went to all this trouble
to not even get a picture with the Pope?

304
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,900
It's out of the question.

305
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,275
Mother, the Holy Father is waiting
there in the car.

306
00:28:32,325 --> 00:28:34,600
This isn't fair,
and it's not equal treatment.

307
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:37,450
Is it plausible to expect
equal treatment with the Pope?

308
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,450
I don't like the attitude of
Pius XIII toward a woman like me

309
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,450
who's given so much to the Church.

310
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,150
Mother, don't forget
the law of reciprocity.

311
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,650
The Holy Father might dislike
your attitude too.

312
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,600
Now try to make a small effort
of peering into the future.

313
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,925
Who would have the worst of it
in this contest?

314
00:28:54,975 --> 00:28:57,700
I have influential philanthropist
friends all over the world.

315
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,575
While the Pope doesn't even
have one friend.

316
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,600
And yet it would take him just
20 minutes

317
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,775
to shut down all 250 Villages
of Goodness.

318
00:29:05,825 --> 00:29:08,575
And believe me, I've come to know
him very well.

319
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:10,825
If he wants to do it, he'll do it.

320
00:29:11,325 --> 00:29:15,000
Now be a good girl
and give me your phone.

321
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,875
And one more thing.

322
00:29:22,775 --> 00:29:24,525
A little gift from the Pope.

323
00:29:24,575 --> 00:29:26,500
Take one.

324
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,025
Wait. No.
Better take two.

325
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,275
Let's go!

326
00:29:51,525 --> 00:29:53,700
This is our church.

327
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,750
Next to it is the dormitory,

328
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:02,900
the health care clinic,

329
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,625
the dental clinic,
the elementary school,

330
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,775
the catechism school,

331
00:30:12,575 --> 00:30:17,150
the cafeteria,
and the administrative offices.

332
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,750
Enough, enough.

333
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,950
Enough, enough.

334
00:30:37,575 --> 00:30:39,250
Enough, enough.

335
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,500
Enough, enough.

336
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:46,900
Enough.

337
00:30:48,325 --> 00:30:49,750
Enough, enough.

338
00:30:53,825 --> 00:30:55,000
Enough.

339
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,025
Ni mara ngapi mimi aliiambia!

340
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:18,300
Huna kutumia maji,
siyo nzuri kwa ajili ya afya!

341
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,225
Not all that glitters is gold.

342
00:31:25,275 --> 00:31:27,525
That water is dangerous.

343
00:31:27,575 --> 00:31:30,450
It can cause fluorosis, anemia,

344
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,650
joint pains, dental disease,
and kidney failure.

345
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,125
The main problem afflicting
this area has to do with

346
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,400
a supply of safe,
clean drinking water.

347
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:45,200
Our benefactors send us huge
quantities of clean water,

348
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:50,900
but the bureaucracy, the soldiers,
and the gangs hijack it illegally,

349
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,100
and keep it for themselves.

350
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,850
This is a very ingenious system
designed by a Dutch company,

351
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,600
which donated it to us.

352
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:02,525
The water condenses on the glass
and then drips into containers.

353
00:32:02,575 --> 00:32:04,650
There are times when
we manage to collect

354
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,200
as much as three liters a day.

355
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,525
Would you like some water to
drink, Your Holiness?

356
00:32:09,575 --> 00:32:11,275
No thanks.

357
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,900
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

358
00:32:30,775 --> 00:32:33,225
I met this famous American author.

359
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,100
What a tempter!

360
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,350
He said he remembered
only the perverse

361
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,450
and lustful details of women.

362
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,150
Now I can't seem to do anything
but remember my own

363
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,650
very few details of that nature.

364
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,325
You might say to me: which ones?

365
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,450
When I met that girl in California
on the beach,

366
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,850
more than thirty years ago.

367
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,275
She told me:

368
00:32:56,325 --> 00:32:57,475
"You can touch my legs".

369
00:32:57,525 --> 00:33:00,225
It's become an obsessive,
very unhealthy thought.

370
00:33:00,275 --> 00:33:03,100
Also, even though it was
in good faith,

371
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:08,100
I never even realized I was doing
it, I must have sinned with Esther,

372
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,825
Peter, and little Pius.

373
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:14,175
They left the Vatican,
without saying goodbye to me.

374
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,375
Just vanished.

375
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:19,700
Now I can't seem to sleep at night,

376
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,650
because I'm thinking about
the photo that they left behind,

377
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,700
a photo I thought mattered to them:

378
00:33:26,825 --> 00:33:30,525
a photo of me holding
little Pius in my arms.

379
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,225
At times like this,

380
00:33:32,275 --> 00:33:37,200
I feel guilty, because I should be
thinking about my only true friend:

381
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,125
Andrew Dussolier...

382
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:42,850
dead because of me,

383
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,025
and yet I've already stopped
feeling guilty about it.

384
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,900
This enormous burden swept away

385
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,575
by a tiny morsel of guilt.

386
00:33:54,175 --> 00:33:59,500
How strange the human soul can be,
isn't that true, Father?

387
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,450
Finally, Father, the world!

388
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,325
Pity, compassion...

389
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,750
forgiveness...

390
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:22,000
all this Christian virtues the
world no longer attributes to me.

391
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,325
Can they be right?

392
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,325
Am I cruel?

393
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:35,550
All I know is everything I do,
I do for the love of God.

394
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,500
And that's all.

395
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,650
My penitence, Father?

396
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:54,025
My penitence, Father?

397
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,625
Do you speak English?

398
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,850
You couldn't have told me before?

399
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,825
You've just letting me rattle on
like an idiot

400
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:18,125
for the past ten minutes!

401
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:32,775
"Sister Antonia hides the water.

402
00:35:32,825 --> 00:35:36,575
And she uses it to control
the sick and the nuns.

403
00:35:37,175 --> 00:35:42,400
In exchange for a few glasses
of water she demands favors,

404
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:46,325
obscene acts,
and filth I could never repeat.

405
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:51,775
I beg you, please, Father,
only you can help us."

406
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,450
Accipite et bibite ex eo omnes.

407
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,050
Haec quotiescumque feceritis,

408
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:10,200
in mei memoriam facietis.

409
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,050
I have to tell you something,
Holy Father.

410
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,725
Your Eminence, I don't wanna
hear any more bad news.

411
00:37:05,775 --> 00:37:07,350
You might not believe it,

412
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,700
but for the first time I have
a piece of good news to give you.

413
00:37:12,775 --> 00:37:14,450
Let's hear it, then.

414
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:19,100
The simple fact that you have
announced your first pastoral visit

415
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,775
and the prospect
of your first public appearance

416
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:28,400
have resulted in a 12% increase
in the number of requests

417
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:32,650
to take part in your next mass
at St. Peter's.

418
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,825
The morbid curiosity
prompted by absence.

419
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,650
Your Eminence, as an orphan,
I'm very familiar with this.

420
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,625
Holy Father, will you appear here,
in Africa, for the first time?

421
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,050
You once asked me who I really am.

422
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,250
- Do you remember that?
- Certainly.

423
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,700
I'm just a man.

424
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,650
- That's the answer.
- That's not all.

425
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,700
Your Holiness, you are the Church.

426
00:38:09,575 --> 00:38:11,075
How wonderful!

427
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:13,725
And to think that there are
still people who believe

428
00:38:13,775 --> 00:38:16,375
that God doesn't exist.

429
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,325
What was that American journalist
on the plane referring to?

430
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,475
Oh, probably just
one of the many slanders

431
00:38:24,525 --> 00:38:27,825
making the rounds
about the Holy Father.

432
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,825
Kurtwell and Belardo
know each other

433
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:33,150
because they both
worked in New York, and that's all.

434
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,150
Oh I...

435
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,575
- Forgive me.
- No.

436
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:02,200
The civil war in this country,

437
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,450
practically speaking,
has never stopped.

438
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,725
It's hard to even come up with
an estimate of the number of dead.

439
00:39:08,775 --> 00:39:12,650
The arrival of the Holy Father
has been particularly useful

440
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,225
because it at least forced
the sides to call a truce.

441
00:39:16,275 --> 00:39:20,200
My fear is that, as soon as His
Holiness leaves this land of ours,

442
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,575
the warring bands will go back
to slaughtering each other

443
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:24,725
just like before.

444
00:39:24,775 --> 00:39:27,100
Prince Abadi is a good man.

445
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:30,100
He's a great philanthropist,
generous with us,

446
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,525
and he does what he can
to halt the violence,

447
00:39:32,575 --> 00:39:36,925
but without international aid
the task is daunting.

448
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:40,400
I'd use my words with care,
Mother Antonia.

449
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,700
The U.N. denounces Abadi

450
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:46,375
as a ferocious torturer
and old-school dictator,

451
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:50,075
that's why there has been
no international aid.

452
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:54,100
Your Eminence, I've been
in this place for many years.

453
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,400
Prince Abadi is a good man.

454
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:00,500
The United Nations has been
in this place for some time, too.

455
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:03,100
Prince Abadi is a good man.

456
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:07,125
The question here is: what exactly
does it mean to be a good person?

457
00:40:09,025 --> 00:40:13,000
Let's take you for instance Sister
Antonia: are you a good person?

458
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,350
- I believe I am.
- Don't be in such a hurry.

459
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,300
Think carefully.

460
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:24,500
I try to live in accordance
with Christian values.

461
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:29,025
Which ones?

462
00:40:29,775 --> 00:40:33,750
You can use Christian values
for all kinds of purposes.

463
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:38,775
A good person is somebody
who puts himself last,

464
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,475
who renounces
his own temptations and needs,

465
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:46,400
working only for the interests
of others.

466
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:51,275
Now think carefully
and answer sincerely,

467
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:55,000
because I won't put up with
even the tiniest lie from you:

468
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,650
are you a good person?

469
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,900
There seems to be a some kind
of misunderstanding

470
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:14,200
concerning the meaning
of my visit here to you.

471
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,325
You think I'm here to honor you.

472
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,700
In fact, I'm here
to ascertain your temptations.

473
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:34,550
Heal yourself, Sister Antonia.

474
00:41:35,775 --> 00:41:39,425
Halitosis is a deformation
of the soul.

475
00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:52,825
Water problem.

476
00:44:01,525 --> 00:44:06,300
Ladies and gentlemen,
His Holiness Pius XIII.

477
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,475
This is the vicar of Christ,

478
00:44:16,525 --> 00:44:20,475
Pope Pius XIII,
speaking to you now.

479
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:25,025
Brothers and sisters, I want to be
perfectly clear with you.

480
00:44:27,575 --> 00:44:30,650
I have visited your country
and I have seen dead bodies

481
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,950
lying on the ground,

482
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,450
hunger, blood, thirst, and poverty.

483
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:45,575
All these things are the offspring
of the war and violence

484
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:49,275
that has clutched your land
for twelve years now.

485
00:44:49,775 --> 00:44:54,350
I won't say the names of those
who are guilty in this.

486
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,400
There are too many of them.

487
00:44:57,075 --> 00:44:58,825
We are all guilty.

488
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:03,450
We are all guilty of war and death.

489
00:45:05,575 --> 00:45:07,500
Always.

490
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:12,950
In the same way,
we can all be guilty of peace.

491
00:45:14,425 --> 00:45:16,400
Always.

492
00:45:17,775 --> 00:45:21,025
I ask this of you on bended knee.

493
00:45:22,175 --> 00:45:24,300
I am ready to die for you,

494
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:29,850
if only
you will become guilty of peace.

495
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:35,250
I always say to the children who
write me from all over the world:

496
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,850
think about all the things
you like.

497
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,750
That is God.

498
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,850
Children like all sorts of things,

499
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:51,000
but none of them has ever written
that what they like is war.

500
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,575
Now look at whoever is next to you.

501
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,950
Look at them with eyes of joy
and remember

502
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,225
what St. Augustine said:

503
00:46:08,275 --> 00:46:12,825
"If you want to see God,
you have the means to do it.

504
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,125
God is love."

505
00:46:26,275 --> 00:46:28,450
I, on the other hand,

506
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,975
won't speak to you about God
until there is peace.

507
00:46:32,025 --> 00:46:34,225
Because God is peace.

508
00:46:34,275 --> 00:46:37,075
And peace is God.

509
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:43,150
Give me peace,

510
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,250
and I'll give you God.

511
00:46:52,325 --> 00:46:55,725
You don't know how wonderful
peace is.

512
00:46:55,775 --> 00:47:00,650
You have no idea how disconcerting
peace can be.

513
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:09,775
But I know.

514
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:15,700
Because I saw it when I was
eight years old

515
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:22,075
on the banks of a river
in Colorado... peace.

516
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:56,350
It was beautiful.

517
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,750
Yeah, I know.

518
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:04,450
Those dancers
gave a wonderful performance.

519
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,600
No, Holy Father,
I'm talking about your speech.

520
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,450
It was beautiful.

521
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:25,825
Holy Father, weather conditions
in Rome are critical.

522
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:28,800
We're going to have to land
in Naples.

523
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:31,575
I would never dare
to contradict you.

524
00:49:31,625 --> 00:49:33,525
Naples it is.

525
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:38,700
- May I touch?
- No!

526
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,200
I need to stop
at the next gas station.

527
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,000
Certainly, Your Holiness.

528
00:51:15,425 --> 00:51:17,200
O Lord...

529
00:51:18,525 --> 00:51:21,700
let us look each other
right in the eyes,

530
00:51:22,525 --> 00:51:26,575
we can no longer put off
this matter.

531
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,900
We now need to speak
about Sister Antonia.

532
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:44,075
Blessed Virgin!

533
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:46,700
Maria...

534
00:52:48,075 --> 00:52:49,625
Maria...

535
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,025
Maria.

536
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:12,825
Maria.

537
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,250
Maria.

538
00:53:24,325 --> 00:53:25,575
Maria.

539
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,750
Maria.
