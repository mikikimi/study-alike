1
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,240
How's your blog going?

2
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,600
Yeah, good, very good.

3
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,280
You haven't written a word, have you?

4
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,120
You just wrote
"still has trust issues".

5
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,160
And you read my writing upside down.

6
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,800
You see what I mean?

7
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,720
John, you're a soldier

8
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,360
and it's going to take you
a while to adjust to civilian life

9
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,200
and writing a blog
about everything that happens to you
will honestly help you.

10
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,680
Nothing happens to me.

11
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,680
'What do you mean there's no ruddy
car?' He went to Waterloo, I'm sorry.

12
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,360
Get a cab! I never get cabs!

13
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,200
I love you. When?

14
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,400
Get a cab!

15
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,000
My husband

16
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,200
was a happy man
who lived life to the full.

17
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,520
He loved his family and his work,

18
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,040
and that he should have
taken his own life in this way

19
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,080
is a mystery

20
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,400
and a shock to all who knew him.

21
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,200
Taxi, taxi!

22
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,160
I'll be just two minutes, mate.
What?

23
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,200
I'm just going home to get
my umbrella. You can share mine.

24
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,640
Two minutes, all right?

25
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,440
She still dancing?

26
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,240
Yeah, if you can call it that.

27
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,320
Did you get the car keys off her?
Got them out of her bag.

28
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,960
Where is she?

29
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,280
The body of Beth Davenport,
Junior Minister for Transport,

30
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,920
was found late last night
on a building site in Greater London.

31
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,560
Preliminary investigations
suggest that this was suicide.

32
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,520
We can confirm that this apparent
suicide closely resembles those of

33
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,280
Sir Jeffrey Patterson
and James Phillimore.

34
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,920
In the light of this, these incidents
are now being treated as linked.

35
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,920
The investigation is ongoing
but Detective Inspector Lestrade
will take questions now.

36
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,280
Detective Inspector,
how can suicides be linked?

37
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,400
Well, they all took the same poison.

38
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,600
They were all found in places
they had no reason to be.

39
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,760
None of them had shown any prior
indication. But you can't have
serial suicides.

40
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,440
Well, apparently you can.

41
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,480
These three people,
there's nothing that links them?

42
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,000
There's no link we've found yet but

43
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,240
we're looking for it.
There has to be one.

44
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,560
If you've all got texts, please
ignore them. It just says "Wrong".

45
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,960
Well, just ignore that.
If there are no more questions,

46
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,600
I'm going to bring
this session to an end.

47
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,280
If they're suicides,
what are you investigating?

48
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,600
As I say, these suicides
are clearly linked.

49
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,280
It's an unusual situation, we've
got our best people investigating.

50
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,160
Says "Wrong" again.

51
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,360
One more question. Is there any
chance that these are murders?

52
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,120
And if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

53
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,960
I know that you like
writing about these but these
do appear to be suicides.

54
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,000
We know the difference. The poison
was clearly self-administered.

55
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,040
Yes, but if they are murders,
how do people keep themselves safe?

56
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,600
Well, don't commit suicide.

57
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,960
Daily Mail!

58
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:48,840
This is a frightening time
for people but all anyone has to do
is exercise reasonable precautions.

59
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,720
We are all as safe as we want to be.

60
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,080
MOBILE PHONES BUZZ

61
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,680
Thank you.

62
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,800
You've got to stop him doing that.
He's making us look like idiots.

63
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,360
If you can tell me
how he does it, I'll stop him.

64
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,440
John!

65
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,080
John Watson!

66
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,840
Stamford, Mike Stamford.
We were at Barts together.
Yes, sorry, yes, Mike, hello.

67
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,320
Yes, I know, I got fat. No, no.

68
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,120
I heard you were abroad somewhere
getting shot at. What happened?

69
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,600
I got shot.

70
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,600
Are you still at Barts then?

71
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,880
Teaching now, yeah, bright
young things like we used to be.

72
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,960
God, I hate them.

73
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,680
What about you, just staying in
town till you get yourself sorted?

74
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,440
I can't afford London
on an Army pension.

75
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,833
Couldn't bear to be anywhere else. That's not the John Watson I know.

76
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:01,160
I'm not the John Watson.

77
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,560
Couldn't Harry help?

78
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,640
Yeah, like that's going to happen(!)

79
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,680
I don't know,
get a flatshare or something?

80
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,360
Who'd want me for a flatmate?

81
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,480
What?

82
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,920
You're the second person
to say that to me today.

83
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,280
Who was the first?

84
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,840
How fresh?

85
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,720
Just in. 67, natural causes.

86
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,880
Used to work here.
I knew him, he was nice.

87
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,120
Fine.

88
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,280
We'll start with the riding crop.

89
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,080
So, bad day was it?

90
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,200
I need to know what bruises
form in the next 20 minutes.
A man's alibi depends on it. Text me.

91
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,520
Listen, I was wondering.
Maybe later, when you're finished...

92
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,600
You're wearing lipstick.
You weren't wearing lipstick before.

93
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,560
I refreshed it a bit.

94
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,080
Sorry, you were saying?

95
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,880
I was wondering
if you'd like to have coffee?

96
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,600
Black, two sugars, please.
I'll be upstairs.

97
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,160
OK.

98
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
KNOCK ON DOOR

99
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,280
Bit different from my day.
You've no idea!

100
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,480
Mike, can I borrow your phone?
There's no signal on mine.

101
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,360
And what's wrong with the landline?
I prefer to text.

102
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,520
Sorry, it's in my coat.

103
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,280
Here, use mine.

104
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,800
Oh, thank you.

105
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,920
This is an old friend of mine,
John Watson.

106
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,320
Afghanistan or Iraq?

107
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,520
Sorry?
Which was it, in Afghanistan or Iraq?

108
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,840
Afghanistan, sorry,
how did you know?

109
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,960
Ah! Coffee, thank you.

110
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,520
What happened to the lipstick?

111
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,360
It wasn't working for me.

112
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,560
Really? It was a big improvement.
Your mouth's too small now.

113
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,120
OK.

114
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,760
How do you feel about the violin?

115
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,520
I'm sorry, what?

116
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,480
I play the violin when I'm thinking
and sometimes I don't talk for days
on end. Would that bother you?

117
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,680
Potential flatmates should know
the worst about each other.

118
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,480
You told him about me? Not a word.

119
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,360
Who said anything about flatmates?

120
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,680
I did. Told Mike this morning
that I must be a difficult man
to find a flatmate for.

121
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,920
Now here he is just after lunch with
an old friend clearly just home from

122
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,760
military service in Afghanistan.
Wasn't a difficult leap.

123
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,200
How did you know about Afghanistan?

124
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,440
Got my eye on a nice little place
in central London.

125
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,120
We ought to be able to afford it.

126
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,200
We'll meet there tomorrow
evening, seven o'clock.

127
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,120
Sorry, got to dash. I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

128
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,680
Is that it?

129
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,640
Is that what?

130
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,360
We've only just met and we're
going to go and look at a flat?

131
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,120
Problem?

132
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,200
We don't know
a thing about each other.

133
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,720
I don't know where we're meeting,
I don't even know your name.

134
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,760
I know you're an Army doctor
and you've been invalided home
from Afghanistan.

135
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,880
You've got a brother worried
about you but you won't go
to him for help because you don't

136
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,520
approve of him, possibly because he's
an alcoholic, more likely because
he recently walked out on his wife.

137
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:35,080
And I know that your therapist
thinks your limp's psychosomatic,
quite correctly, I'm afraid.

138
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,560
That's enough to be going
on with, don't you think?

139
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,760
The name's Sherlock Holmes
and the address is 221B Baker Street.

140
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,280
Afternoon.

141
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,960
Yeah, he's always like that.

142
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,200
Hello.

143
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,240
Ah - Mr Holmes. Sherlock, please.

144
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,600
Well, this is a prime spot.
Must be expensive.

145
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Mrs Hudson, the landlady -
she's given me a special deal.

146
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,360
Owes me a favour. A few years back,
her husband got himself
sentenced to death in Florida.

147
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,280
I was able to help out. Sorry - you
stopped her husband being executed?

148
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,840
Oh, no, I ensured it.

149
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,480
Sherlock!

150
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,040
Mrs Hudson, Dr John Watson.

151
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,040
Hello. Come in. Thank you.
Shall we...?

152
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,720
Well, this could be very nice.

153
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,080
Very nice indeed.

154
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,440
Yes.

155
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,960
Yes, I think so,
my thoughts precisely.

156
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:08,840
TOGETHER: So I went straight ahead
and moved in. Soon as we get all this
rubbish cleaned out...

157
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,040
So this is all... Well, obviously I
can erm...straighten things up a bit.

158
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,120
That's a skull. Friend of mine.

159
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,760
When I say friend...

160
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,840
What do you think, then, Dr Watson?

161
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,840
There's another bedroom upstairs,
if you'll be needing two bedrooms.

162
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,840
Of course we'll be needing two.

163
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:33,680
Oh, don't worry, there's all sorts
round here. Mrs Turner next door's
got (married ones).

164
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,520
Oh...
Sherlock! The mess you've made.

165
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,720
I looked you up on
the internet last night.

166
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,200
Anything interesting? Found your
website. The Science of Deduction.

167
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,520
What did you think?

168
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,440
You said you could identify
a software designer by his tie and
an airline pilot by his left thumb?

169
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,720
Yes.

170
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,360
And I can read your military career
in your face and your leg,

171
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,440
and your brother's drinking habits
on your mobile phone.

172
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,560
How?

173
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,640
What about these suicides then,
Sherlock? I thought that'd be
right up your street.

174
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,160
Three exactly the same.

175
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,400
Four.

176
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,960
There's been a fourth.
And there's something different
this time. A fourth?

177
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,640
Where? Brixton, Lauriston Gardens.

178
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,480
What's new about this one? You
wouldn't have come to me otherwise.

179
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,160
You know how they never leave notes?
Yeah. This one did.

180
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,120
Will you come?

181
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,000
Who's on forensics? Anderson.

182
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,680
He doesn't work well with me.

183
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,320
Well, he won't be your assistant.
I NEED an assistant.

184
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,920
Will you come? Not in a police car,
I'll be right behind.

185
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,720
Thank you.

186
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
Brilliant! Yes!

187
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,600
Four serial suicides, and now a note.

188
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,760
Oh, it's Christmas. Mrs Hudson,
I'll be late. Might need some food.

189
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,520
I'm your landlady, dear,
not your housekeeper.

190
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,120
Something cold will do. John, have
a cup of tea, make yourself at home.

191
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,880
Don't wait up!

192
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,400
Look at him, dashing about...

193
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:26,440
My husband was just the same.
But you're more
the sitting-down type, I can tell.

194
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,600
I'll make you that cuppa,
you rest your leg.

195
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,200
Damn my leg! Sorry, I'm so sorry -

196
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,120
It's just sometimes
this bloody thing...

197
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,960
I understand, dear, I've got a hip.

198
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,960
Cup of tea'd be lovely. Thank you.
Just this once, dear,
I'm not your housekeeper.

199
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,720
Couple of biscuits too, if you've
got 'em. Not your housekeeper!

200
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,880
You're a doctor.

201
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,600
In fact you're an Army doctor.

202
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,960
Yes.

203
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,440
Any good?

204
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,480
Very good.

205
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,280
Seen a lot of injuries, then.
Violent deaths.

206
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,320
Well, yes.

207
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,920
Bit of trouble too, I bet?

208
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,200
Of course. Yes.
Enough for a lifetime, far too much.

209
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Want to see some more? Oh, God, yes.

210
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,040
Sorry Mrs Hudson, I'll skip the tea.
Off out. Both of you?

211
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,360
Impossible suicides? Four of them?

212
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,520
No point sitting at home when there's
finally something fun going on!

213
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,920
Look at you, all happy. It's not
decent. Who cares about decent?

214
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,320
The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!

215
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,440
Taxi!

216
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,720
OK, You've got questions...

217
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,760
Yeah, where are we going?

218
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,200
Crime scene. Next?

219
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,360
Who are you, what do you do?
What do you think?

220
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,960
I'd say...private detective. But?

221
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,880
But the police don't go
to private detectives.

222
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,600
I'm a consulting detective. Only
one in the world, I invented the job.

223
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,840
What does that mean? Means when
the police are out of their depth,
which is always,

224
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,800
they consult me.
The police don't consult amateurs.

225
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,720
When I met you for the first time
yesterday, I said Afghanistan
or Iraq. You looked surprised.

226
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,800
Yes, how DID you know?
I didn't know, I saw.

227
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,720
'Your haircut, the way
you hold yourself says military.

228
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,200
'But your conversation...'
Bit different from my day.

229
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,120
..said trained at Barts -
so Army doctor, obvious.

230
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,880
'Your face is tanned...

231
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,280
'but no tan above the wrists. You've
been abroad, but not sunbathing.

232
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,360
'Your limp's really bad
when you walk, but you don't ask
for a chair when you stand -

233
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,360
'so it's at least partly
psychosomatic.

234
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,520
'That says the original circumstances
of the injury were traumatic -'

235
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,440
wounded in action then. Wounded in
action, suntan - Afghanistan or Iraq.

236
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,160
You said I had a therapist.

237
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,280
You've got a psychosomatic limp,
of course you've got a therapist.

238
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,160
Then there's your brother. Mm?
Your phone.

239
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,200
'It's expensive,
e-mail enabled, MP3 player.'

240
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,440
And you're looking for a flatshare.
You wouldn't buy this - it's a gift.

241
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,680
'Scratches.
Not one, many over time -'

242
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,640
it's been in the same pocket
as keys and coins.

243
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,840
You wouldn't treat
your one luxury item like this,

244
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,960
so it's had a previous owner.
Next bit's easy. You know it already.

245
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,520
The engraving?

246
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,560
Harry Watson. Clearly a family
member who's given you his old phone.

247
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,800
Not your father,
this is a young man's gadget.

248
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,840
Could be a cousin, but you're a war
hero who can't find a place to live -

249
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,800
unlikely you've got an extended
family, not one you're close to.
So brother it is.

250
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,720
Now, who's Clara? Three kisses
says it's a romantic attachment.

251
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,120
The expense of the phone
says wife, not girlfriend.

252
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,680
Must have given it to him recently,
it's only six months old.

253
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,360
Marriage in trouble then -
six months on he's given it away.

254
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,640
If she'd left HIM,
he would have kept it. Sentiment.

255
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,520
No, he wanted rid of it. He left HER.

256
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,960
He gave the phone to you,
so he wants you to stay in touch.

257
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,120
You're looking for cheap
accommodation, but you're not
going to your brother for help -

258
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,720
that says you've got problems
with him. Maybe you liked his wife,
or don't like his drinking.

259
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,800
How can you possibly know
about the drinking?

260
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,920
Shot in the dark. Good one, though.

261
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,200
Power connection -
tiny little scuff marks round it.

262
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,720
Every night he plugs it in
but his hands are shaking.

263
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,800
You never see those marks
on a sober man's phone,

264
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,160
never see a drunk's without them.
There you go, you were right.
I was right? Right about what?

265
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,440
The police don't consult amateurs.

266
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,920
That...was amazing.

267
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,280
Do you think so? Of course it was.
It was extraordinary,
it was quite extraordinary.

268
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,160
That's not what people normally say.
What do people normally say?

269
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,640
Piss off!

270
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,120
Did I get anything wrong?

271
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,040
Harry and me don't get on,
never have,

272
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,200
Clara and Harry split up
three months ago

273
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,280
and they're getting a divorce,

274
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,760
and Harry is a drinker.

275
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,520
Spot on, then. I didn't expect
to be right about everything.

276
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,480
Harry's short for Harriet.

277
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,280
Harry's your sister.
Look, what exactly am I supposed
to be doing here? Sister!

278
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,720
No - seriously, what am I doing
here? There's always something.

279
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,320
Hello, freak! I'm here to see
Detective Inspector Lestrade.

280
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,840
Why?

281
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,040
I was invited.

282
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Why?
I think he wants me to take a look.

283
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,560
Well, you know what I think,
don't you? Always Sally.

284
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,640
I even know you didn't
make it home last night.

285
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,480
I don't... Who's this?
Colleague of mine, Dr Watson.

286
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,280
Dr Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan.

287
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,840
Old friend.

288
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,520
A colleague(?)
How do YOU get a colleague?

289
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,840
Did he follow you home?

290
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,400
Would it be better
if I just waited... No.

291
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,520
Freak's here. Bringing him in.

292
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,160
Ah, Anderson. Here we are again.

293
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,080
It's a crime scene. I don't want it
contaminated. Are we clear on that?

294
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,200
Quite clear.

295
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,080
And is your wife away for long?

296
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,760
Oh, don't pretend you worked
that out. Somebody told you that.

297
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,160
Your deodorant told me that.

298
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,280
My deodorant?

299
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,080
It's for men. Well, of course
it's for men - I'm wearing it.

300
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,320
So's Sergeant Donovan.

301
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,720
Ooh... I think it just vaporised.
May I go in?

302
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,240
Whatever you're trying to imply...

303
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:51,080
I'm not implying anything. I'm sure
Sally came round for a nice little
chat, and just happened to stay over.

304
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,760
And I assume she scrubbed
your floors, going by
the state of her knees.

305
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,520
You'll need to wear one of these.

306
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,960
Who's this?

307
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,520
He's with me.

308
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,160
But who is he? I said he's with me.

309
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,440
Aren't you going to put one on?

310
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,160
So where are we? Upstairs.

311
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,760
I can give you two minutes.

312
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,080
May need longer.

313
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,760
Her name's Jennifer Wilson
according to her credit cards,

314
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,440
we're running them now
for contact details.

315
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,200
Hasn't been here long.

316
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,800
Some kids found her.

317
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,200
Shut up.

318
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,680
I didn't say anything.
You were thinking. It's annoying.

319
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,160
Got anything?

320
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,160
Not much.

321
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,360
She's German.

322
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,920
Rache. It's German for revenge.
She could be trying to
tell us something...

323
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,880
Yes, thank you for your input.

324
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,160
So she's German? Of course she's
not. She's from out of town though.

325
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,880
Intended to stay in London
for one night

326
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,040
before returning home to Cardiff.
So far, so obvious.

327
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,080
Sorry - obvious?
What about the message though?

328
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,560
Dr Watson, what do you think?

329
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,920
Of the message?
Of the body. You're a medical man.

330
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,520
We have a whole team right outside.

331
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,600
They won't work with me. I'm breaking
every rule letting YOU in here...

332
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,000
Yes...because you need me.

333
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,360
Yes, I do.

334
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,640
God help me.

335
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,400
Dr Watson! Hm?

336
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,160
Oh, do as he says. Help yourself.

337
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,040
Anderson, keep everyone out
for a couple of minutes...

338
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,360
Well? What am I doing here?

339
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,080
Helping me make a point. I'm supposed
to be helping you pay the rent.
This is more fun.

340
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,400
Fun? There's a woman lying dead.

341
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,920
Perfectly sound analysis,
but I WAS hoping you'd go deeper.

342
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,200
Yeah...

343
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,800
Asphyxiation, probably.
Passed out, choked on her own vomit.

344
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,520
Can't smell any alcohol on her.

345
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,720
It could have been a seizure.
Possibly drugs.

346
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,640
You know what it was,
you've read the papers.

347
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,880
Well, she's one of the suicides.
The fourth...?

348
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,880
Sherlock - two minutes, I said,
I need anything you got.

349
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,480
Victim is in her late 30s.
Professional person,
going by her clothes -

350
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,760
I'm guessing the media, going by
the frankly alarming shade of pink.

351
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,080
Travelled from Cardiff today
intending to stay in London one night
from the size of her suitcase.

352
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,680
Suitcase? Yes. She's been married
at least ten years, but not happily.

353
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,480
She's had a string of lovers but
none of them knew she was married.

354
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,760
Oh, for God's sake,
if you're just making this up...

355
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,320
Her wedding ring.
Ten years old at least.

356
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:38,600
The rest of her jewellery
has been regularly cleaned,
but not her wedding ring.

357
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,400
The inside
is shinier than the outside.

358
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,120
The only polishing it gets
is when she works it off her finger.

359
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,520
It's not for work, look at her nails.
She doesn't work with her hands
so who DOES she remove her rings for?

360
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,240
Not ONE lover,
she'd never sustain the fiction
of being single for that long

361
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,200
so more likely a string of them.
Brilliant.

362
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,640
Sorry. Cardiff?

363
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,880
It's obvious, isn't it?
It's not obvious to me.

364
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,160
Dear God, what is it like
in your funny little brains,
it must be so boring. Her coat -

365
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,880
it's slightly damp, she's been
in heavy rain the last few hours -

366
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,600
no rain anywhere in London
in that time.

367
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,240
Under her coat collar is damp too.
She's turned it up against the wind.

368
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,800
She's got an umbrella in her pocket
but it's dry and unused.

369
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,360
Not just wind, strong wind -
too strong to use her umbrella.

370
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,280
We know from her suitcase that
she was intending to stay overnight

371
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,640
but she can't have travelled more
than two or three hours because
her coat still hasn't dried.

372
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,800
So - where has there been
heavy rain and strong wind within
the radius of that travel time?

373
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,120
Cardiff.

374
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,440
Fantastic.
Do you know you do that out loud?

375
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,080
Sorry, I'll shut up.
No, it's...fine.

376
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,120
Why do you keep saying suitcase?
Yes, where is it?

377
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,160
She must have had a phone or
an organiser. Find out who Rachel is.
She was writing Rachel?

378
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,840
No, she was leaving an angry note
in German - of course she was writing
Rachel, no other word it can be.

379
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,760
Why did she wait until she was dying
to write it? How do you know
she had a suitcase?

380
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,800
Tiny splash marks on her right heel
and calf not present on the left.

381
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,360
She was dragging a wheeled suitcase
behind her with her right hand,
by that splash pattern.

382
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,520
Smallish case, going by the spread.

383
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,280
Case that size,
woman this clothes-conscious -

384
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,240
could only be an overnight bag
so we know she was staying one night.

385
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,680
Where is it,
what have you done with it?

386
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,520
There wasn't a case.

387
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,520
Say that again. There wasn't a case.
There was never any suitcase.

388
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,000
Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase?
Was there a suitcase in this house?

389
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,600
Sir, there was no case!

390
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,360
But they take the poison themselves,
swallow the pills.

391
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,920
There are clear signs,
even you lot couldn't miss them.
Right, thanks. And...?

392
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,040
It's murder, all of them.
I don't know how.

393
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,400
But they're not suicides,
they're serial killings.

394
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,760
We've got a serial killer. There's
always something to look forward to.

395
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,800
Why are you saying that?
Her case! Come on, where is her case?

396
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,760
Did she eat it(?) Someone else
was here, and they took her case.

397
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,880
So the killer must have driven here.
Forgot the case was in the car.

398
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,080
She could have checked into a hotel,
left it there.

399
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,160
No, look at her hair.
She colour-coordinates
her lipstick and her shoes.

400
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,920
She'd never have left any hotel
with her hair still looking...

401
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,400
Oh...

402
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,840
Oh!

403
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,480
Sherlock? What is it, what?

404
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,200
Serial killers, always hard.
You have to wait for them
to make a mistake.

405
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,360
We can't just wait! Oh, we're done
waiting. Look at her, really look!

406
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,640
Houston, we have a mistake.
Get on to Cardiff.

407
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,760
Find out who Jennifer Wilson's
family and friends were. Find Rachel!

408
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,640
Of course, yeah - but what mistake?!

409
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,760
Pink!

410
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,600
ANDERSON: Let's get on with it...

411
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,720
He's gone. Who, Sherlock Holmes?

412
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,000
Yeah, he just took off.
He does that.

413
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,080
Is he coming back?
Didn't look like it.

414
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,040
Right.

415
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,760
Right...

416
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,720
Yes. Sorry, where am I?

417
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,320
Brixton.

418
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,200
Do you know where I could get a cab?

419
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,440
It's just er...

420
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,080
well -

421
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,760
my leg.

422
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,600
Er...

423
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,720
..try the main road.

424
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,880
Thanks.

425
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,440
But you're not his friend.

426
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,400
He doesn't HAVE friends.

427
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,560
So who are you?

428
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,440
I'm...I'm nobody. I just met him.

429
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,440
OK, bit of advice then.
Stay away from that guy.

430
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,440
Why?

431
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,560
You know why he's here?

432
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,840
He's not paid or anything.

433
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,160
He likes it. He gets off on it.

434
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,600
The weirder the crime, the more
he gets off. And you know what...?

435
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,760
One day just showing up
won't be enough.

436
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,040
One day we'll be standing
round a body and he'll be the one
that put it there.

437
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,120
Why would he do that?
Because he's a psychopath.

438
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,680
Psychopaths get bored.

439
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,640
LESTRADE: Donovan! Coming.

440
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,120
Stay away from Sherlock Holmes.

441
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,360
Hello?

442
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,880
MAN: 'There is a security camera
on the building to your left.

443
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,360
'Do you see it?'

444
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,800
Who's this?

445
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,120
Who's speaking?

446
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,080
'Do you see the camera, Dr Watson?'

447
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,400
Yeah, I see it. 'Watch...

448
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,320
'There is another camera
on the building opposite you.
Do you see it?'

449
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,400
Mm-hm.

450
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,600
'And finally, at the top of
the building on your right.'

451

CAMERA WHIRS

452
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,160
How are you doing this?

453
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,320
'Get into the car, Dr Watson.

454
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,840
'I would make some sort of threat,
but I'm sure your situation
is quite clear to you.'

455
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,840
Hello. Hi.

456
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,120
What's your name, then?

457
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,840
Er...Anthea.

458
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,680
Is that your real name? No.

459
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,280
I'm John.

460
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,960
Yes. I know.

461
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,360
Any point in asking...
where I'm going?

462
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,240
None at all...

463
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,520
John.

464
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,240
OK.

465
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,040
Have a seat, John.

466
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,440
You know, I've got a phone.

467
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,480
I mean, very clever and all that,

468
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,560
but er...

469
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,240
you could just phone me.

470
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,680
On my phone.

471
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,480
When one is avoiding the attention
of Sherlock Holmes, one learns
to be discreet, hence this place.

472
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,280
Your leg must be hurting you.
Sit down.

473
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,760
I don't want to sit down.

474
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,200
You don't seem very afraid.

475
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,880
You don't seem very frightening.

476
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,520
HE CHUCKLES
Yes...

477
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,480
The bravery of the soldier.

478
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,040
Bravery is by far the kindest
word for stupidity, don't you think?

479
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,520
What is your connection
to Sherlock Holmes?

480
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:33,160
I don't have one. I barely know him,
I met him...yesterday.

481
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,480
Mmm, and since yesterday you've
moved in with him and now you're
solving crimes together.

482
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,760
Might we expect a happy announcement
by the end of the week?

483
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,280
Who are you? An interested party.

484
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,240
Interested in Sherlock? Why?

485
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,320
I'm guessing you're not friends.

486
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,720
You've met him. How many friends
do you imagine he has?

487
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,360
I am the closest thing to a friend
that Sherlock Holmes is capable of
having. And what's that?

488
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,040
An enemy. An enemy?

489
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,920
In HIS mind, certainly.

490
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,560
If you were to ask him,
he'd probably say his arch-enemy.

491
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,440
He does love to be dramatic.

492
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,760
Well, thank God
YOU'RE above all that.

493
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,600
TEXT MESSAGE ALERT

494
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,040
I hope I'm not distracting you.

495
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,440
Not distracting me at all.

496
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,560
Do you plan to continue your
association with Sherlock Holmes?

497
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,840
I could be wrong...

498
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,360
but I think that's
none of your business.

499
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,080
It could be. It really couldn't.

500
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,000
If you DO move into, erm...

501
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,040
..221B Baker Street,

502
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,280
I'd be happy to

503
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,000
pay you a meaningful sum of money
on a regular basis to ease your way.

504
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,320
Why?

505
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,960
Because you're not a wealthy man.

506
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,560
In exchange for what?

507
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,280
Information.

508
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,760
Nothing indiscreet. Nothing
you'd feel...uncomfortable with.

509
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,520
Just tell me what he's up to. Why?

510
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,000
I worry about him. Constantly.

511
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,680
That's nice of you.

512
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,120
But I would prefer
for various reasons
that my concern go unmentioned,

513
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,360
we have what you might call a...
difficult relationship.

514
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,600
TEXT MESSAGE ALERT

515
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,200
No.
But I haven't mentioned a figure.

516
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,920
Don't bother.

517
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,960
You're very loyal VERY quickly.

518
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,760
No, I'm not,
I'm just not interested.

519
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,640
"Trust issues"...it says here.

520
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,520
What's that?

521
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,520
Could it be that you've decided to
trust Sherlock Holmes of all people?

522
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,480
Who says I trust him? You don't seem
the kind to make friends easily.

523
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,280
Are we done?

524
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,320
You tell me.

525
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,560
I imagine people have already
warned you to stay away from him,

526
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,760
but I can see from your left hand
that's not going to happen.

527
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,360
My what? Show me.

528
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,280
Don't...

529
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,800
Remarkable. What is?

530
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:38,480
Most people...blunder round
this city, and all they see
are streets and shops and cars.

531
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,320
When you walk with Sherlock
Holmes, you see the battlefield.

532
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,720
You've seen it already. Haven't you?

533
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,880
What's wrong with my hand?

534
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,480
You have an intermittent tremor
in your left hand.

535
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,560
Your therapist thinks it's
post-traumatic stress disorder.

536
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,480
She thinks you're haunted by
memories of your military service.

537
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,000
Who the hell are you?

538
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,280
How do you know that? Fire her.
She's got it the wrong way round.

539
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,960
You're under stress right now
and your hand is perfectly steady.

540
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,640
You're not haunted by the war,
Dr Watson...

541
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,120
You miss it.

542
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,600
Welcome back.

543
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,480
Time to choose a side, Dr Watson.

544
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,320
I'm to take you home.

545
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,200
Address?

546
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,360
Er, Baker Street.

547
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,080
221B Baker Street.

548
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,600
But I need to stop off
somewhere first.

549
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:29,080
Listen, your boss.
Any chance you could not tell him
this is where I went?

550
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,640
Sure. You've told him
already, haven't you?

551
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,080
Yeah.

552
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,640
Hey erm...
do you ever get any free time?

553
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,920
SHE CHUCKLES
Oh, yeah. Lots.

554
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,720
Bye... OK.

555
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,560
What are you doing?

556
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,160
Nicotine patch.

557
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,600
Helps me think.

558
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,360
Impossible to sustain a smoking
habit in London these days.

559
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,120
Bad news for brain work.

560
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,160
It's good news for breathing.
Oh... Breathing! Breathing's boring.

561
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,960
Is that...three patches?

562
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,760
It's a three-patch problem.

563
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,120
Well...?

564
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,080
You asked me to come,
I'm assuming it's important.

565
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,240
Oh - yeah, of course.
Can I borrow your phone?

566
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,120
My phone? Always a chance
that my number will be recognised.
It's on the website.

567
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,080
Mrs Hudson's got a phone.
Yeah, she's downstairs.

568
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,200
I tried shouting but she didn't hear.
I WAS the other side of London...

569
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,000
There was no hurry.

570
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,440
Here...

571
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,320
So what's this about - the case?

572
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,760
Her case... HER case?
Her suitcase, yes, obviously.

573
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,240
The murderer took her suitcase,
first big mistake.

574
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,880
OK, he took her case. So?

575
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,080
It's no use, there's no other way.
We'll have to risk it.

576
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,600
On my desk there's a number.
I want you to send a text.

577
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,560
You've brought me here...
to send a text.

578
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,080
Text, yes. The number on my desk.

579
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,880
What's wrong?
Just met a friend of yours.

580
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,840
A friend? An enemy.

581
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,320
Oh. Which one?

582
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,520
Well, your arch-enemy, according to
him. Do people have arch-enemies?

583
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,240
Did he offer you money to spy on me?

584
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,120
Yes. Did you take it?

585
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,120
No. Pity, we could have split the
fee. Think it through next time.

586
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,440
Who is he?
The most dangerous man you've ever
met, and not my problem right now.

587
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,080
On my desk, the number!

588
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,320
Jennifer Wilson. That was...

589
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,520
Hang on. Wasn't that the dead woman?

590
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,400
Yes. That's not important.
Just enter the number.

591
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,840
Are you doing it? Yes.
Have you done it?

592
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,280
Yeah - hang on!

593
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,920
These words exactly.

594
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,360
"What happened at Lauriston Gardens?

595
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,160
"I must have blacked out.

596
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,280
"22 Northumberland Street,

597
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,840
please come." You blacked out?

598
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,160
What? No... No!

599
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,920
Type and send it. Quickly.

600
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,000
Have you sent it? What's the address?

601
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,360
22 Northumberland Street. Hurry up!

602
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,920
That's...

603
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,880
That's the pink lady's case,
that's Jennifer Wilson's case.

604
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,240
Yes, obviously.

605
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,960
Oh, perhaps I should mention -
I didn't kill her.
I never said you did.

606
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,080
Why not? Given that text
and the fact I have her case
it's a perfectly logical assumption.

607
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,360
Do people usually assume
you're the murderer?

608
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,000
Now and then, yes.

609
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,560
OK...

610
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,800
How did you get this? By looking.

611
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,640
Where? The killer must have
driven her to Lauriston Gardens.

612
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,520
He could only keep her case
by accident if it was in the car.

613
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,320
Nobody could be seen with this case
without drawing attention -

614
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,240
particularly a man,
which is statistically more likely.

615
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,840
So obviously he'd feel compelled
to get rid of it.

616
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,960
Wouldn't have taken him more than
five minutes to realise his mistake.

617
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,640
I checked every backstreet
wide enough for a car
five minutes from Lauriston Gardens,

618
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,200
'and anywhere you could dispose of a
bulky object without being observed.

619
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,480
'Took me less than an hour
to find the right skip.'

620
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,680
Pink. You got all that because
you realised the case would be pink?

621
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,000
It had to be pink, obviously.
Why didn't I think of that(?)

622
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,600
Because you're an idiot.

623
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,280
No, no, no, don't look like that.
Practically everyone is.

624
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,000
Now, look. Do you see what's missing?

625
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,200
From the case? How could I?

626
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,960
Her phone. Where's her mobile phone?

627
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,480
There was no phone on the body,
there's no phone in the case.

628
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,000
We know she had one.
You just texted it.

629
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,320
Maybe she left it at home.

630
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:36,560
She has a string of lovers
and she's careful about it.
She never leaves her phone at home.

631
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,200
Er...

632
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,960
Why did I just send that text?

633
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,360
Well, the question is
where is her phone NOW?

634
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,960
She could have lost it. Yes, or?

635
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,880
The murderer... You think
the murderer has the phone?

636
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:57,160
Maybe she...left it
when she left her case. Maybe
he took it from her for some reason.

637
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,600
Either way,
the balance of probability is
the murderer has her phone.

638
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,160
Sorry...what are we doing -
did I just text a murderer?
What good will that do?

639
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,240
A few hours after his last victim,

640
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,640
and now he receives a text
that can only be from her.

641
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,640
If somebody had just found that phone
they'd ignore a text like that,
but the murderer...

642
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,320
would panic.

643
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,520
Have you talked to the police? Four
people are dead, there isn't time.

644
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,240
So why are you talking to ME?

645
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,000
Mrs Hudson took my skull.

646
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,160
So I'm basically filling in
for your skull?

647
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,440
Relax, you're doing fine.

648
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,720
Well? Well, what? Well - you could
just sit there and...watch telly.

649
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,617
What, you want me to come with you? I like company when I go out,

650
00:47:44,618 --> 00:47:46,400
and I think better when I talk aloud.

651
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,800
The skull just
attracts attention, so...

652
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,240
Problem? Yeah, Sergeant Donovan.

653
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,080
What about her?

654
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,160
She said...

655
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,400
you get off on this. You enjoy it.

656
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,000
And I said "dangerous",
and here you are.

657
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,120
Damn it!

658
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,520
Where are we going?
Northumberland Street's
a five-minute walk from here.

659
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,080
You think he's stupid enough
to go there?
No - I think he's brilliant enough.

660
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,040
I love the brilliant ones. They're
all so desperate to get caught.

661
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,280
Why? Appreciation!

662
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,960
Applause! At long last the spotlight.

663
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,680
That's the frailty of genius, John,
it needs an audience. Yeah.

664
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,000
This is his hunting ground.
Right here in the heart of the city.

665
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,360
Now that we know his victims were
abducted, that changes everything.

666
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,320
Because all of his victims
disappeared from busy streets,

667
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,360
crowded places,
but nobody saw them go.

668
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,680
Think! Who do we trust,
even though we don't know them?

669
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,040
Who passes unnoticed
wherever they go?

670
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,360
Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?

671
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,480
Don't know. Who?

672
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,440
Haven't the faintest. Hungry?

673
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,680
Thank you, Billy.

674
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,840
22 Northumberland Street.

675
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,120
Keep your eyes on it.

676
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,080
He's not just going to ring
the doorbell. He'd need to be mad.

677
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,600
He HAS killed four people.

678
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,120
OK.

679
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,320
Sherlock!

680
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,880
Anything on the menu,
whatever you want, free.

681
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,160
On the house, for you
and for your date.

682
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,880
Do you want to eat? I'm not his date.

683
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,080
This man got me off a murder charge.

684
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:38,600
This is Angelo. Three years ago
I proved to Lestrade at the time of
a particularly vicious triple murder

685
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,680
that Angelo was elsewhere,
house-breaking.

686
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,400
He cleared my name. I cleared it
a bit. Anything happening opposite?

687
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,600
Nothing.

688
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,400
But for this man, I'd have gone
to prison. You did go to prison.

689
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,120
I'll get a candle for the table.
It's more romantic.

690
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,640
I'm not his date!

691
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,520
You may as well eat.
We might have a long wait.

692
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,040
Thanks.

693
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,160
People don't have arch-enemies.

694
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,160
I'm sorry? In real life.

695
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,560
There are no arch-enemies
in real life. Doesn't happen.

696
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,920
Doesn't it? Sounds a bit dull.

697
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,920
So who did I meet?

698
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,760
What do real people have, then,
in their..."real lives"?

699
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,240
Friends?

700
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,480
People they know, people they like,
people they don't like...

701
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,360
Girlfriends, boyfriends.
Yes, well, as I was saying - dull.

702
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,960
You don't have a girlfriend, then.

703
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,040
Girlfriend? No, not really my area.

704
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,480
Mm.

705
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,080
Oh, right.

706
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,680
Do you have a...boyfriend?
Which is fine, by the way.

707
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,760
I know it's fine.

708
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,600
So you've got a boyfriend then. No.

709
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,440
Right. OK.

710
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,640
You're unattached. Like me.

711
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,400
Fine. Good.

712
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,280
John, erm...

713
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,040
I think you should know that
I consider myself married to my work,

714
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,360
and while I'm flattered,
I'm really not looking for any... No,

715
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,120
I'm...not asking. No.

716
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,080
I'm just saying, it's all fine.

717
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,520
TAXI OUTSIDE
Good.

718
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,400
Thank you.

719
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,520
Look across the street.
Taxi. It's stopped.

720
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,440
Nobody getting in,
and nobody getting out.

721
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,760
Why a taxi?

722
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,480
Oh, that's clever. Is it clever?
Why is it clever? That's him.

723
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,640
Don't stare.

724
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,680
You're staring. We can't both stare.

725
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,640
Sorry...

726
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,400
I've got the cab number.
Good for you.

727
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,240
Right turn, one way, roadworks,
traffic lights, bus lane,

728
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,640
pedestrian crossing, left turn only,
traffic lights.

729
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,040
Sorry.

730
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,680
Come on, John...

731
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,600
Come on, John. We're losing him!

732
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,120
This way.

733
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,320
No - THIS way!

734
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,120
Sorry...

735
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,960
Police! Open her up.

736
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,240
SHERLOCK PANTS
No...

737
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,440
Teeth, tan. What - Californian...?

738
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,240
LA, Santa Monica. Just arrived.

739
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,160
How could you possibly know that?
The luggage.

740
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,600
Probably your first trip
to London, right?

741
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,040
Going by your final destination
and the cabbie's route.

742
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,080
Sorry - are you guys the police?

743
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,440
Yeah. Everything all right?

744
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,320
Yeah.

745
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,400
Welcome to London.

746
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,480
Er, any problems - just let us know.

747
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,720
Basically just a cab that
happened to slow down. Basically.

748
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,760
Not the murderer.
Not the murderer, no.

749
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,800
Wrong country, good alibi.

750
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,960
As they go.
Hey, where did you get this?

751
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,200
Detective Inspector Lestrade? Yeah.

752
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,080
I pickpocket him when he's annoying.

753
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,600
You can keep that one,
I've got plenty at the flat.

754
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,360
What?
Nothing, just..."Welcome to London".

755
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,960
Got your breath back?
Ready when you are.

756
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,120
OK...

757
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,880
That was ridiculous.

758
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,400
That was the most
ridiculous thing...I've ever done.

759
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,760
And you invaded Afghanistan.
THEY LAUGH

760
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,680
That wasn't just me.

761
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,320
Why aren't we back
at the restaurant?

762
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,560
They can keep an eye out.

763
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,560
It was a long shot anyway.

764
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,480
So what were we doing there?

765
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,040
Oh, just passing the time.

766
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,800
And proving a point.

767
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,360
What point? You.

768
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,400
Mrs Hudson! Dr Watson
WILL take the room upstairs.

769
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,880
Says who?

770
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,480
Says the man at the door.

771
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,360
Sherlock texted me.
He said you forgot this.

772
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,800
Ah...

773
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,560
Er, thank you.

774
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,760
Thank you.

775
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,800
Sherlock, what have you done?

776
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,920
Mrs Hudson? Upstairs.

777
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,880
What are you doing? Well, I knew
you'd find the case, I'm not stupid.

778
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,080
You can't just break into my flat.
You can't withhold evidence -
and I didn't break in.

779
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,440
Well, what do you call this then?

780
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,120
It's a drugs bust.
Seriously? This guy - a junkie?

781
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,200
Have you met him? John...

782
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:45,440
You could search this flat all day,
you wouldn't find anything
you could call recreational.

783
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,680
John, you probably want to
shut up now. But come on...

784
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,360
No... What?

785
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,400
You?
Shut up! I'm not your sniffer dog.

786
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,640
No, Anderson's my sniffer dog.

787
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,440
Anderson, what are YOU doing here
on a drugs bust?

788
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:05,240
Oh, I volunteered. They all did.
They're not strictly speaking ON the
drug squad, but they're very keen.

789
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,200
Are these human eyes?
Put those back!

790
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,640
They were in the microwave.
It's an experiment.

791
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,080
Keep looking, guys.

792
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,360
Or you could help us properly
and I'll stand them down.

793
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,560
This is childish.
Well, I'm dealing with a child.

794
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,600
Sherlock, this is our case.
I'm letting you in,
but you do not go off on your own.

795
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,680
Clear? What - so you set up
a pretend drugs bust to bully me?

796
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,080
It stops being pretend
if we find anything. I am clean!

797
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,920
Is your flat...? All of it?

798
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,560
Don't even smoke.

799
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,760
Neither do I.

800
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,920
So let's work together.

801
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,680
We've found Rachel. Who is she?

802
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,320
Jennifer Wilson's only daughter.

803
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,280
Her daughter?

804
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,840
Why would she write
her daughter's name? Why?

805
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,280
Never mind that, we found the case.

806
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:53,080
According to SOMEONE the murderer
has the case, and we found it in the
hands of our favourite psychopath.

807
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,280
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Do your research.

808
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,960
You need to bring Rachel in
and I need to question her.

809
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,960
She's dead. Excellent.
How, when and why? Is there
a connection? There has to be.

810
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,120
Well, I doubt it,
since she's been dead for 14 years.
Technically she was never alive.

811
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:12,240
Rachel was Jennifer Wilson's
stillborn daughter, 14 years ago.

812
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,600
No, that's...

813
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,480
..that's not right. How...

814
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,400
Why would she do that? Why?

815
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,560
Why would she think of her daughter
in her last moments? Yup -
sociopath, I'm seeing it now.

816
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,600
She didn't think about her daughter.

817
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,320
She scratched her name on the floor
with her fingernails. She was dying.

818
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,120
It took effort, it would have hurt.

819
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:35,640
You said that the victims
all took the poison themselves,
that he MAKES them take it -

820
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:40,720
well, maybe he...I don't know,
talks to them. Maybe he used
the death of her daughter somehow.

821
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,040
Yeah, but that was ages ago.
Why would she still be upset?

822
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,200
Not good?

823
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,320
Bit not good, yeah.

824
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:54,680
If you were dying...
If you'd been murdered - in your very
last few seconds what would you say?

825
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,560
"Please, God, let me live."
Use your imagination!

826
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,080
I don't have to.

827
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,600
Yeah, but if you were clever...
Jennifer Wilson running
all those lovers - she WAS clever.

828
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,440
She's trying to tell us something.

829
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,120
Isn't the doorbell working?
Your taxi's here, Sherlock.

830
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:13,640
I didn't order a taxi. Go away.
Oh, dear. They're making such
a mess. What are they looking for?

831
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,360
It's a drugs bust, Mrs Hudson.

832
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,480
But they're just for my hip.
They're herbal soothers...

833
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,600
Shut up, everybody! Don't speak,
don't breathe. I'm trying to think.

834
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,880
Anderson, face the other way.
You're putting me off.

835
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,440
What? My FACE is(?)
Everybody quiet and still.

836
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,720
Anderson, turn your back.
Oh, for God's sake!

837
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,400
Your back, now, please!

838
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,400
Come on, think. Quick!
What about your taxi?

839
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,640
MRS HUDSON!

840
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,080
Oh...

841
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,320
Ah!

842
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,880
She was clever. Clever, yes!

843
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:48,320
She's cleverer than you lot and she's
dead. Do you see, do you get it?

844
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,920
She didn't lose her phone, she
never lost it. She PLANTED it on him.

845
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,960
When she got out of the car, she
knew that she was going to her death.

846
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,080
She left the phone in order to
lead us to her killer. But how?

847
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,960
What do you mean, how?

848
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,560
Rachel!

849
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,480
Don't you see? Rachel!

850
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,600
Oh...

851
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,280
Look at you lot.
You're all so vacant.

852
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,080
Is it nice not being me?
It must be so relaxing.

853
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,240
Rachel is not a name.

854
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,120
Then what is it? John -
on the luggage, there's a label.

855
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,200
E-mail address.

856
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:26,080
Er, jennie.pink@mephone.org.uk.

857
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:31,360
She didn't have a laptop, which means
she did her business on her phone.
A smartphone, it's e-mail enabled.

858
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,000
So there was a website
for her account.

859
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,160
The username is her e-mail address -
and all together, the password is?

860
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,440
Rachel.
So we can read her e-mails. So what?

861
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,440
Anderson, don't talk out loud.
You lower the IQ of the whole street.

862
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,240
We can do much more than that.
It's a smartphone, it's got GPS.

863
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:50,040
Which means if you lose it you can
locate it online. She's leading us
directly to the man who killed her.

864
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,160
Unless he got rid of it.
We know he didn't.

865
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,680
Come on, come on. Quickly!
Sherlock, dear. This taxi driver...

866
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,360
Mrs Hudson, isn't it time
for your evening soother?

867
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,440
Get vehicles, get a helicopter. This
phone battery won't last for ever.

868
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,600
We'll just have a map reference,
not a name. It's a start!

869
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,120
Sherlock... Narrows it down
from just anyone in London.

870
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,600
It's the first proper lead
that we've had. Sherlock...

871
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,040
Where is it? Quickly, where?

872
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,040
Here. It's...in 221 Baker Street.

873
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,880
How can it be here?

874
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,280
How?

875
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,800
Maybe it was in the case
when you brought it back
and it...fell out somewhere.

876
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,400
What, and I didn't notice it?
Me - I didn't notice?

877
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,200
Anyway, we texted him
and he called back.

878
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,240
Guys, we're also looking
for a mobile somewhere here,

879
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,360
belonged to the victim... 'Who do we
trust, even if we don't know them?

880
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,120
'Who passes unnoticed
wherever they go?

881
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,120
'Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?'

882
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,120
Sherlock, you OK? What...?

883
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,360
Yeah, yeah... I'm fine.

884
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,320
So, how can the phone be here?

885
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,560
Don't know.

886
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,640
I'll try it again. Good idea.

887
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,320
Where are you going?

888
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,800
Fresh air, just popping outside
for a moment. Won't be long.

889
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,920
You sure you're all right? I'm fine.

890
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,800
Taxi for Sherlock Holmes.

891
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,280
I didn't order a taxi.

892
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,400
Doesn't mean you don't need one.

893
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,280
You're the cabbie.

894
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,200
The one who stopped outside
Northumberland Street.

895
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,440
It was you. Not your passenger.

896
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,600
See?
No-one ever thinks about the cabbie.

897
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,600
It's like you're invisible.

898
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,400
Just the back of an 'ead.

899
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,080
Proper advantage
for a serial killer.

900
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,400
Is this a confession? Oh, yeah.

901
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,680
I'll tell you what else...

902
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,720
If you call the coppers now,
I won't run.

903
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,520
I'll sit quiet and they can
take me down, I promise.

904
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,840
Why?

905
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,800
Cos you're not going to do that.
Am I not?

906
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,640
I didn't kill those four people,
Mr Holmes.

907
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,800
I spoke to 'em...

908
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,880
and they killed themselves.

909
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:09,600
If you get the coppers now,
I'll promise you one thing.

910
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,320
I will never tell you what I said.

911
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:22,120
No-one else will die, though, and
I believe they call that a result.

912
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,120
And you won't ever understand
how those people died.

913
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,480
What kind of result
do you care about?

914
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,240
If I wanted to understand...

915
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,120
..what would I do?
Let me take you for a ride.

916
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:54,880
So you can kill me too?
I don't want to kill you, Mr Holmes.

917
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,040
I'm going to talk to ya...

918
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,680
..and then you're
going to kill yourself.

919
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,680
He just got in a cab...
It's Sherlock.
He just drove off in a cab.

920
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,280
I told you, he does that.

921
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,800
He bloody left again.

922
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,520
We're wasting our time!

923
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,920
I'm...calling the phone,
it's ringing out.

924
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,640
And if it's ringing, it's not here.

925
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,560
I'll try the search again.
Does it matter? Does any of it?

926
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:54,360
He's just a lunatic, and he'll
always let you down. And you're
wasting your time. All our time.

927
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,840
OK, everybody...

928
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,360
done here.

929
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,480
How did you find me?

930
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,320
Oh, I recognised ya.

931
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,880
Soon as I saw you chasing my cab.

932
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,000
Sherlock Holmes!

933
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,480
I was warned about you.

934
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,360
I've been on your website, too.
Brilliant stuff! Loved it.

935
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:28,000
Who warned you about me? Just
someone out there who's noticed.

936
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,200
Who?

937
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,040
Who would notice me?

938
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:43,240
You're too modest, Mr Holmes.
I'm really not.

939
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,520
Got yourself a fan.

940
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,200
Tell me more.

941
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,880
That's all you're going to know.

942
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,000
In THIS lifetime.

943
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,520
Why did he do that?
Why did he have to leave?

944
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,880
You know him better than I do.

945
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,120
I've known him for five years -
and no, I don't.

946
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,240
So why do you put up with him?

947
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,200
Because I'm desperate, that's why.

948
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,920
And because Sherlock Holmes
is a great man -

949
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,680
and I think one day,
if we're very, very lucky,

950
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,880
he might even be a good one.

951
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,240
Where are we?

952
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:45,600
You know every street in London.
You know exactly where we are.

953
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,600
Roland-Kerr
Further Education College.

954
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,560
Why here? It's open.

955
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,440
Cleaners are in.

956
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,640
One thing about being a cabbie -
you always know
a nice quiet spot for a murder.

957
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,720
I'm surprised more of us
don't branch out.

958
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,680
And you just walk your victims in?
How?

959
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,320
Oh... Dull.

960
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,880
Don't worry. It gets better.

961
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:14,240
You can't make people take
their own lives at gunpoint. I don't.

962
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,040
It's much better than that.

963
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,120
Don't need this with you.
Cos you'll follow me.

964
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,040
Well, what do you think?

965
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,240
It's up to you.

966
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,080
You're the one
who's going to die here.

967
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,040
No, I'm not.
That's what they all say.

968
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,760
Shall we talk?

969
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,040
Bit risky, wasn't it?

970
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,080
Took me away under the eye of
about half a dozen policemen.

971
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,400
They're not that stupid.

972
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,600
And Mrs Hudson will remember you.

973
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,560
You call that a risk? Nah...

974
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,600
THIS is a risk.

975
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,960
Oh, I like this bit.

976
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,800
Cos you don't get it yet, do ya?

977
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,840
But you're about to.

978
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,520
I just have to do this...

979
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,320
Weren't expecting that, were ya?

980
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,040
Oh, you're going to love this.

981
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:30,720
Love what?
Sherlock Holmes! Look at you!

982
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:37,240
Here in the flesh. That website
of yours, your fan told me about it.

983
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:38,920
My fan?

984
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,520
You are brilliant.

985
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,920
You are a proper genius.

986
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,920
The Science of Deduction.
Now, that...

987
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,000
is proper thinking.

988
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,200
Between you and me sitting here,
why can't people think?

989
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,160
Don't it make you mad?

990
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,920
Why can't people just think?

991
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:09,320
Oh, I see...
So you're a proper genius too.

992
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,520
Don't look it, do I?

993
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,600
Funny little man driving a cab.

994
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,840
But you'll know better in a minute.

995
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,840
Chances are it'll be
the last thing you EVER know.

996
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,320
OK, two bottles. Explain.

997
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,520
There's a good bottle
and a bad bottle.

998
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,120
You take the pill from
the good bottle, you live.

999
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:35,280
You take the pill from
the bad bottle...you die.

1000
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,920
Both bottles are of course identical.
In every way.

1001
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,880
And you know which is which.
Of course I know. But I don't.

1002
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,720
Wouldn't be a game if you knew.
You're the one who chooses.

1003
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:47,720
Why should I? I've got nothing
to go on. What's in it for me?

1004
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,520
I haven't told you the best bit yet.

1005
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,720
Whatever bottle YOU choose,

1006
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,400
I take the pill from the other one.

1007
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,840
And then together...

1008
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,320
we take our medicine.

1009
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:05,400
I won't cheat. It's your choice.

1010
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,800
I'll take whatever pill you don't.

1011
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,120
Didn't expect that,
did you, Mr Holmes?

1012
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:16,680
This is what you did
to the rest of them -

1013
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:19,080
you gave them a choice?
And now I'm giving you one.

1014
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,640
You take your time.

1015
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,520
Get yourself together.

1016
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:28,480
I want your best game.
It's not a game, it's chance.

1017
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,200
I've played four times. I'm alive.

1018
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,080
It's not chance, Mr Holmes,
it's chess.

1019
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,680
It's a game of chess,

1020
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:42,360
with one move...and one survivor.

1021
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,200
And this - this...

1022
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,960
is the move.

1023
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,600
Did I just give you the good bottle
or the bad bottle?

1024
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,840
You can choose either one.

1025
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,360
No, Detective Inspector Lestrade -
I need to speak to him.

1026
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,120
It's important. It's an emergency.

1027
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,400
Er, left here, please. Left here...

1028
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,480
You ready yet, Mr Holmes?

1029
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:30,280
Ready to play? Play what?
It's a 50:50 chance.

1030
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,920
You're not playing the numbers,
you're playing ME.

1031
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,000
Did I just give you the good pill
or the bad pill?

1032
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,120
Is it a bluff,

1033
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,200
or a double bluff?

1034
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,320
Or a triple bluff?
It's still just chance.

1035
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,320
Four people, in a row?
It's not chance.

1036
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,000
Luck. It's genius!

1037
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:52,200
I know how people think.

1038
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,160
I know how people think I think.

1039
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,600
I can see it all
like a map inside my head.

1040
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,920
Everyone's so stupid, even you.

1041
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,600
Or maybe God just loves me.

1042
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,800
Either way,
you're wasted as a cabbie.

1043
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,040
So...

1044
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:25,120
You risked your life four times
just to kill strangers? Why?

1045
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,680
Time to play.

1046
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:29,200
Oh, I am playing.

1047
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,400
This is my turn.

1048
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:35,920
There's shaving foam behind your left
ear. Nobody's pointed it out to you.

1049
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:40,680
Traces of where it's happened before,
so obviously you live on your own -
there's no-one to tell you.

1050
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,600
But there's a photograph of children.
Their mother's been cut out.

1051
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,320
If she'd died, she'd still be there.

1052
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,280
The photograph's old,
but the frame's new.

1053
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,680
You think of your children,
but you don't get to see them.

1054
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,000
Estranged father.

1055
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,920
She took the kids,

1056
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,360
but you still love them
and it still hurts.

1057
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,640
Ah, but there's more.

1058
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,680
Your clothes. Recently laundered,

1059
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:06,400
but everything you're wearing
is at least...three years old?

1060
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:10,320
Keeping up appearances,
but not planning ahead.

1061
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:15,320
And here you are on a kamikaze
murder spree. What's that about?

1062
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,640
Ah...

1063
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,840
Three years ago.
Is that when they told you?

1064
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,200
Told me what?

1065
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,280
That you're a dead man walking.
So are you.

1066
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,920
You don't have long, though.

1067
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,040
Am I right?

1068
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,400
Aneurism. Right in 'ere.

1069
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:41,280
Any breath could be my last.

1070
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,760
And because you're dying,
you've just murdered four people.

1071
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,640
I've outlived four people.

1072
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,040
That's the most fun you can have
with an aneurism.

1073
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:55,760
No... No, there's something else.

1074
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,760
You didn't just kill four people
because you're bitter.
Bitterness is a paralytic.

1075
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,760
Love
is a much more vicious motivator.

1076
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:08,400
Somehow, this is about your children.

1077
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,800
Oh...

1078
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,280
You ARE good, in't ya? But how?

1079
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,520
When I die they won't get much,
my kids.

1080
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,880
Not a lot of money in driving cabs.

1081
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,240
Or serial killing.
You'd be surprised.

1082
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,880
Surprise me.

1083
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,640
I have a sponsor.

1084
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:35,920
You have a what? For every life
I take, money goes to my kids.

1085
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:39,360
The more I kill...
the better off they'll be.

1086
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,440
You see? It's nicer than you think.

1087
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,400
Who'd sponsor a serial killer?

1088
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,040
Who'd be a fan of Sherlock Holmes?

1089
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,440
You're not the only one
to enjoy a good murder.

1090
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:58,600
There's others out there just
like you, except you're just a man.

1091
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,200
And they're so much more than that.

1092
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,760
What do you mean...

1093
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,800
more than a man?

1094
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,920
An organisation...? What?

1095
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:15,160
There's a name, that no-one says.

1096
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,960
And I'm not going to say it either.

1097
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,760
Now, enough chatter.

1098
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,480
Time to choose.

1099
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,760
Sherlock?!

1100
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,920
Sherlock!

1101
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:40,360
What if I don't choose either?
I could just walk out of here.

1102
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:46,360
You can take a 50:50 chance,

1103
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:49,320
or I can shoot you in the head.

1104
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,320
Funnily enough,

1105
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,320
no-one's ever gone for that option.

1106
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,360
I'll have the gun, please.

1107
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,040
Are you sure?

1108
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,840
Definitely. The gun.

1109
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,880
You don't want to phone a friend(?)

1110
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,240
The gun.

1111
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,920
I know a real gun when I see one.

1112
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,120
None of the others did. Clearly.

1113
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:23,560
Well, this has been very interesting.

1114
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:26,040
I look forward to the court case.

1115
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,920
Just before you go,
did you figure it out?

1116
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,480
Which one's the good bottle?

1117
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,640
Course. Child's play.

1118
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,920
Well, which one, then?

1119
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,880
Which one would you have picked?

1120
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,000
Just so I know whether
I could have beaten you.

1121
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,080
Come on!

1122
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,880
Play the game.

1123
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,840
Oh!

1124
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,240
Interesting.

1125
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:19,040
So what do you think?

1126
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,080
Shall we?

1127
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,920
Really... What do you think?

1128
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,760
Can you beat me?

1129
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:34,040
Are you clever enough...

1130
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,920
..to bet your life?

1131
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,240
FAINTLY: SHERLOCK!

1132
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:54,560
I bet you get bored, don't you?

1133
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,480
I know you do.

1134
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:01,200
A man like you. So clever.

1135
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:06,600
But what's the point of being clever
if you can't prove it?

1136
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,400
Still the addict.

1137
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,720
But this...this is what
you're really addicted to.

1138
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,120
You'll do anything...

1139
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,320
..anything at all,
to stop being bored.

1140
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,080
You're not bored now, are ya?

1141
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,400
Isn't it good?

1142
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,160
Was I right?

1143
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,000
I was, wasn't I?

1144
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,400
Did I get it right?!

1145
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:56,120
OK... Tell me this.

1146
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,960
Your sponsor. Who was it?

1147
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:02,040
The one who told you about me,
my fan.

1148
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,880
I want a name.

1149
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:05,400
No...

1150
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:08,520
You're dying,
but there's still time to hurt you.

1151
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:11,160
Give me...a name.

1152
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,640
A name! Now.

1153
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:19,920
The name!

1154
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:48,240
Why have I got this blanket?
They keep putting this blanket on me.

1155
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,960
Yeah, it's for shock.
I'm not in shock.

1156
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:52,640
Yeah, but some of the guys
want to take photographs.

1157
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,040
So, the shooter. No sign?

1158
01:21:56,040 --> 01:22:00,160
Cleared off before we got here.
But a guy like that
would have had enemies, I suppose.

1159
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:03,360
One of them could have
been following him, but...

1160
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,440
we've got nothing to go on.

1161
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,040
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1162
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:10,200
OK. Give me.

1163
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:13,200
The bullet they just dug
out of the wall's from a handgun.

1164
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:17,760
A kill shot over that distance,
that's a crack shot.
But not just a marksman, a fighter.

1165
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,400
His hands couldn't have shaken at all
so clearly he's acclimatised
to violence.

1166
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:25,280
He didn't fire until I was
in immediate danger though,
so strong moral principle.

1167
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:29,360
You're looking for a man
probably with a history
of military service, and...

1168
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,640
nerves of steel...

1169
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:40,680
Actually, do you know what?
Ignore me. Sorry? Ignore all of that.

1170
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,400
It's just the er...the shock talking.

1171
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,280
Where are you going? I just
need to...talk about the rent.

1172
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:49,680
I've still got questions.
What now? I'm in shock -
look, I've got a blanket.

1173
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:54,920
Sherlock! And, I just caught you
a serial killer... More or less.

1174
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,920
OK. We'll pull you in tomorrow,
off you go.

1175
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:12,200
Erm - Sergeant Donovan has...
just been explaining everything.

1176
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,240
The two pills...

1177
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,240
Dreadful business, isn't it?
Dreadful.

1178
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,440
Good shot.

1179
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:23,720
Yes. Yes, must have been. Through
that window. Well, you'd know.

1180
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:28,200
Need to get the powder burns
out of your fingers.

1181
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:32,320
I don't suppose you'd serve time for
this, but let's avoid the court case.

1182
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,080
Are you all right?
Yes, of course I'm all right.

1183
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:36,760
Well, you have just killed a man.
Yes...

1184
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:41,840
That's true, isn't it?

1185
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,120
But he wasn't a very nice man.

1186
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:50,560
No. No, he wasn't, really, was he?
Frankly a bloody awful cabbie.

1187
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,520
SHERLOCK CHUCKLES
That's true, he was a bad cabbie.

1188
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,280
You should have seen
the route he took us to get here.

1189
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:59,000
Stop it! We can't giggle,
it's a crime scene. Stop it.

1190
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,480
Well, you're the one who shot him.
Keep your voice down.

1191
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:05,040
Sorry, it's just erm...
nerves, I think. Sorry.

1192
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:09,360
You were going to take that damn
pill, weren't you? Course I wasn't.

1193
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:12,360
Biding my time. Knew you'd turn up.

1194
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,000
No, you didn't.

1195
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,720
That's how you get your kicks,
isn't it - you risk your life
to prove you're clever.

1196
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:20,680
Why would I do that?
Because you're an idiot.

1197
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:24,840
Dinner? Starving.

1198
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:27,600
End of Baker Street there's
a good Chinese. Stays open till two.

1199
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,160
You can tell a good Chinese by the
bottom third of the door handle.

1200
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:34,120
Sherlock... That's him, that's
the man I was talking to you about.

1201
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,720
I know exactly who that is.

1202
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:39,320
So... Another case cracked.

1203
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,840
How very public-spirited.

1204
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,160
Though that's never really
your motivation, is it?

1205
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,840
What are you doing here?

1206
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,400
As ever, I'm concerned about you.

1207
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,800
Yes, I've been hearing
about your "concern".

1208
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,560
Always so aggressive.

1209
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:55,440
Did it never occur to you that
you and I belong on the same side?

1210
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,520
Oddly enough - no.

1211
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:00,600
We have more in common
than you'd like to believe.

1212
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:03,720
This petty feud between us
is simply childish.

1213
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:07,480
People will suffer. And you know
how it always upset Mummy.

1214
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,280
I upset her?

1215
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:12,640
Me?

1216
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,960
It wasn't me that upset her, Mycroft.

1217
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,360
No. No, wait...

1218
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,760
Mummy? Who's Mummy?

1219
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,200
Mother. Our mother.

1220
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,880
This is my brother, Mycroft.

1221
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,840
Putting on weight again?

1222
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,280
Losing it, in fact.
He's your brother?

1223
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,160
Course he's my brother.

1224
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:31,720
So he's not... Not what?

1225
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,640
I don't know... Criminal mastermind?

1226
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,960
Close enough. For goodness' sake.

1227
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,280
I occupy a minor position
in the British government.

1228
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:46,160
He IS the British government,
when he's not too busy being
the British secret service

1229
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,800
or the CIA on a freelance basis.

1230
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:51,400
Good evening, Mycroft. Try not
to start a war before I get home,

1231
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,040
you know what it does
for the traffic.

1232
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:59,320
So, when you say you're
concerned about him -
you actually are concerned?

1233
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,840
Yes, of course.

1234
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,960
I mean, it actually is
a childish feud?

1235
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,920
He's always been so resentful.

1236
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:10,560
You can imagine
the Christmas dinners. Yeah...

1237
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,600
No... God, no.

1238
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,520
I'd better erm...

1239
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,680
Hello again.

1240
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:20,920
Hello.
We met earlier on this evening.

1241
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,960
Oh! OK. Goodnight.

1242
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,600
Goodnight, Dr Watson.

1243
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,200
So, dim sum. Mmm!

1244
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,720
I can always predict
the fortune cookies. No, you can't.

1245
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,760
Almost can. You did get shot, though.

1246
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,120
Sorry? In Afghanistan.
There was an actual wound.

1247
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:38,520
Oh. Yeah, shoulder.
Shoulder! I thought so.

1248
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:41,840
No, you didn't. The left one.
Lucky guess. I never guess.

1249
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,400
Yes, you do.

1250
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:46,040
What are you so happy about?
Moriarty.

1251
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:49,200
What's Moriarty?
I've absolutely no idea.

1252
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,480
Sir, shall we go?

1253
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:56,280
Interesting, that soldier fellow.

1254
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:59,040
He could be the making
of my brother...

1255
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,680
or make him worse than ever.

1256
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:04,680
Either way, we'd better
upgrade their surveillance status.

1257
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,080
Grade three active.

1258
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,080
Sorry, sir - whose status?

1259
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:14,440
Sherlock Holmes, and Dr Watson.
