1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,159
Just tell me what happened from
the beginning.

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,839
We had been to a bar,

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,599
nice place, and, er, I got
chatting

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,959
with one of the waitresses, and
Karen weren't happy with that,
so...

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,239
when we get back to the hotel, we
end up having a bit of a
ding-dong,

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,919
don't we?

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,599
She's always getting at me, saying
I weren't a real man.

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,039
Wasn'ta real man.

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,399
- What?
- It's not "weren't", it's
"wasn't".

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,119
Oh.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,159
Go on.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,399
Well... then I don't know how it
happened,

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,879
but suddenly there's a knife in my
hands...

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,439
...and you know me old man was a
butcher, so I know how to handle
knives.

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,959
- He learned us how to cut up a
beast.
- Taught.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,199
- What?
- Taught you how to cut up a
beast.

17
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,399
Yeah, well, then I done it.

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,759
- Did it.
- Did it! Stabbed her!

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,799
Over and over and over, and I
looked down, and she weren't...

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,879
...wasn't...

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,039
...moving no more.

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,639
Any more.

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,559
God help me, I dunno how it
happened, but it was an accident,
I swear.

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,879
Eh, you've gotta help me, Mr
Holmes!

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,439
Everyone says you're the best.

26
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,839
Without you...

27
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,359
...I'll get hung for this.

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,599
No, not at all, Mr Bewick.

29
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,999
Hanged, yes.

30
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,239
What the hellare you doing?!

31
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,719
- Bored.
- What?!

32
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,599
- Bored!
- No...

33
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,279
- Bored!

34
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,559
Don't know what's got into the
criminal classes.

35
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,919
- Good job I'm not one of them.
- So you take it out on the wall?

36
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,759
The wall had it coming.

37
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,679
What about that Russian case?

38
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,079
Belarus? Open and shut domestic
murder. Not worth my time.

39
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,839
Oh, shame!

40
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,439
Anything in? I'm starving.

41
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,199
Oh, f...

42
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,359
There's a head.

43
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,799
- A severed head!
- Just tea for me, thanks.

44
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,199
- No, there's a head in the
fridge.
- Yes?

45
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,479
A bloody head!

46
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,679
Well, where else was I supposed to
put it? You don't mind, do you?

47
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,279
- Well...
- Got it from Bart's morgue.

48
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,359
I'm measuring the coagulation of
saliva after death.

49
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,519
I see you've written up the taxi
driver case.

50
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,959
Er... yes.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,039
A Study In Pink.

52
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,239
Nice.

53
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,719
Well, you know. Pink lady, pink
case,

54
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,039
pink phone. There was a lot of
pink. Did you like it?

55
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,879
- Um... no.
- Why not? I thought you'd be
flattered.

56
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,199
Flattered?! "Sherlock sees through
everything and everyone in
seconds.

57
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,159
"What's incredible, though, is how
spectacularly ignorant he is

58
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,119
- "about some things."
- Hang on a minute, I didn't mean
that...

59
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,959
Oh, you meant "spectacularly
ignorant" in a nice way!

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,159
Look, it doesn't matter to me

61
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,399
- who's Prime Minister or...
- Yeah, I know.

62
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,519
...who's sleeping with who...

63
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,639
- Whether the earth goes round the
sun.
- Not that again! It's not
important!

64
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,199
Not impor...?!

65
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,799
It's primary school stuff. How can
you not know that?

66
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,199
Well, if I ever did, I've deleted
it.

67
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,119
Deleted it?

68
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,119
Listen. This is my hard drive, and
it only makes sense

69
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,319
to put things in there that are
useful. Reallyuseful.

70
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,559
Ordinary people fill their heads
with all kinds of rubbish.

71
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,919
That makes it hard to get at the
stuff that matters. Do you see?

72
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,399
But it's the solar system!

73
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,439
Oh, hell! What does that matter?!

74
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,279
So we go round the sun. If we went
round the moon,

75
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,399
or round and round the garden like
a teddy bear,

76
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,799
it wouldn't make any difference!

77
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,479
All that matters to me is the
work! Without that, my brain rots!

78
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,919
Put that in your blog!

79
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,559
Or, better still, stop inflicting
your opinions on the world!

80
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,279
- Where are you going?
- Out! I need some air.

81
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,039
Oh, sorry, love!

82
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,399
Woo-hoo! Have you two had a little
domestic?

83
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,519
Ooh, it's a bit nippy out there.

84
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,159
He should have wrapped himself up
a bit more.

85
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,319
Look at that, Mrs Hudson.

86
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,119
Quiet.

87
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,719
Calm.

88
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,759
Peaceful.

89
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,639
Isn't it hateful?

90
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,719
Oh, I'm sure something will turn
up, Sherlock.

91
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,599
A nice murder. That'll cheer you
up.

92
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,559
Mmm. Can't come too soon.

93
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,919
Hey, what have you done to my
bloody wall?!

94
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,239
I'm putting this on your rent,
young man!

95
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,439
- Morning.
- Oh... m-morning.

96
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,159
See, told you you should have gone
with the Lilo.

97
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,999
No, no, no, it's fine, I slept
fine.

98
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,639
It's very kind of you.

99
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,519
Well, maybe next time I'll let you
kip at the end of my bed, you
know.

100
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,319
...which was discovered quietly
mouldering...

101
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,719
What about the time after that?

102
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,319
...18 months ago. Experts are
hailing it

103
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,599
as the artistic find of the
century and no-one...

104
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,279
- So, do you want some breakfast?
- Love some.

105
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,799
Yeah, well, you'd better make it
yourself because I'm going to have
a shower.

106
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,199
...It fetched over Â£20 million.

107
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,159
This one is anticipated to do even
better. Back now to our main
story.

108
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,719
There has been a massive explosion
in central London.

109
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,079
As yet, there are no reports of
any casualties

110
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,079
and the police are unable to say

111
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,119
if there's any suspicion of
terrorist involvement.

112
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,039
Sarah!

113
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,559
Police have issued an emergency
number...

114
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,999
- Sarah!
...for friends and relatives.

115
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,399
Sorry! I've got to run!

116
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,439
Excuse me, can I get through?
Excuse me. Can I get through?

117
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,479
I live over there.

118
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,599
- Sherlock!

119
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,679
Sherlock!

120
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,799
- John.

121
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,119
I saw it on the telly. Are you OK?

122
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,439
Me? What? Oh, yeah, fine.

123
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,319
- Gas leak, apparently.

124
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,919
- I can't.
- Can't?

125
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,479
Stuff I've got on is just too big.
I can't spare the time.

126
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,839
Never mind your usual trivia. This
is of national importance.

127
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,439
- How's the diet?

128
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,279
Fine.

129
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,999
Perhaps you can get through to
him, John?

130
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,879
- What?
- I'm afraid my brother

131
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,079
can be very intransigent.

132
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,439
If you're so keen, why don't you
investigate it?

133
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,479
No, no, no, no, no. I can't
possibly be away

134
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,159
from the office for any length of
time. Not with the Korean
elections so...

135
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,519
Well, you don't need to know about
that, do you?

136
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,439
Besides, a case like this, it
requires... legwork.

137
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,879
How's Sarah, John? How was the
Lilo?

138
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,999
Sofa, Sherlock. It was the sofa.

139
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,159
- Oh, yes, of course.
- How...? Oh, never mind.

140
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,519
Sherlock's business seems to be
booming since you and he
became... pals.

141
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,119
What's he like to live with?

142
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,799
- Hellish, I imagine.
- I'm never bored.

143
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,799
Good. That's good, isn't it?

144
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,719
Andrew West, known as Westie to
his friends. Civil servant.

145
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,799
Found dead on the tracks at
Battersea station this morning

146
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,439
with his head smashed in.

147
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,239
Jumped in front of a train?

148
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,039
Seems the logical assumption.

149
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,799
- But?
- But?

150
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,559
Well, you wouldn't be here if it
was just an accident.

151
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,559
Huh!

152
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,359
The MoD is working on a new
missile defence system,

153
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,119
the Bruce-Partington Program, it's
called.

154
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,639
The plans for it were on a memory
stick.

155
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,799
That wasn't very clever.

156
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,519
- It's not the only copy.
- Oh.

157
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,079
But it is secret.

158
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,319
And missing.

159
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,599
Top secret?

160
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,079
Very. We think West must have
taken the memory stick.

161
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,479
We can't possibly risk it falling
into the wrong hands.

162
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,359
You've got to find those plans,
Sherlock.

163
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,479
- Don't make me order you.
- I'd like to see you try.

164
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,999
Think it over.

165
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,439
- Goodbye, John.
- Mm.

166
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,479
See you very soon.

167
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,239
Why did you lie?

168
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,959
You've got nothing on.

169
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,799
Not a single case. That's why the
wall took a pounding.

170
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,399
Why did you tell your brother you
were busy?

171
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,039
Why shouldn't I?

172
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,719
Oh.

173
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,959
Nice.

174
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,279
Sibling rivalry. Now we're getting
somewhere.

175
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,959
Sherlock Holmes.

176
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,079
Of course. How can I refuse?

177
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,759
Lestrade - I've been summoned.

178
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,319
Coming?

179
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,879
- If you want me to.
- Of course.

180
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,359
I'd be lost without my blogger.

181
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,799
You like the funny cases, don't
you?

182
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,839
- The surprising ones.
- Obviously.

183
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,079
- You'll love this. That
explosion.
- Gas leak, yes?

184
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,239
- No.
- No?

185
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,839
- No. Made to look like one.
- What?

186
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,119
Hardly anything left of the place,
except a strongbox.

187
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,319
A very strong box, and inside it
was this.

188
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,199
- You haven't opened it?
- It's addressed to you, isn't it?

189
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,039
We've X-rayed it. It's not
booby-trapped.

190
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,199
How reassuring.

191
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,999
Nice stationery.

192
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,079
Bohemian.

193
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,599
What?

194
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,199
From the Czech Republic. No
fingerprints?

195
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,799
No.

196
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,599
She used a fountain pen. Parker
Duofold, Meridian nib.

197
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,119
- She?
- Obviously.

198
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,759
Obviously.

199
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,359
That... That's the phone. The pink
phone.

200
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,359
What, from The Study In Pink?

201
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,999
Well, obviously, it's not the same
phone, but it's supposed to look
like...

202
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,599
Studyln Pink, you read his blog?

203
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,239
Of course I read his blog. We all
do.

204
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,119
Do you really not know that the
Earth goes round the sun?

205
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,599
It isn't the same phone. This
one's brand new.

206
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,999
Someone's gone to a lot of trouble
to make it look like the same
phone.

207
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,599
Which means your blog has a far
wider readership.

208
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,599
You have one new message.

209
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,399
- Was that it?
- No, that's not it.

210
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,159
What in the hell are we supposed
to make of that?

211
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,079
An estate agent's photo and the
bloody Greenwich pips.

212
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,919
- It's a warning.
- A warning?

213
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,279
Some secret societies used to send
dried melon seeds,

214
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,679
orange pips, things like that -
five pips.

215
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,799
They're warning us it's going to
happen again.

216
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,239
- I've seen this place before.
- Hang on.

217
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,439
- What's going to happen again?
- Boom!

218
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,079
Mrs Hudson?

219
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,799
You had a look, didn't you,
Sherlock, when you first came

220
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,399
- to see about your flat?
- The door's been opened.

221
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,319
- Recently.
- No, can't be. That's the only
key.

222
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,999
I can't get anyone interested in
this flat.

223
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,839
It's the damp, I expect - that's
the curse of basements.

224
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,719
I'd a place once when I was first
married. Black mould all up the
wall...

225
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,159
Oh. Dear me.

226
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,519
Shoes.

227
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,519
He's a bomber, remember.

228
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,319
Hello.

229
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,439
H-Hello... sexy.

230
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,839
- Who's this?

231
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,919
I've... sent you... a little puzzle.

232
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,719
Just to say hi.

233
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,759
Who's talking? Why are you crying?

234
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,359
I... I'm not crying.

235
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,159
I'm typing.

236
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,359
And this... stupid bitch

237
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,519
is reading it out.

238
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,959
The curtain rises.

239
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,479
- What?
- Nothing.

240
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,639
- No, what did you mean?
- I've been expecting this for
some time.

241
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,479
12 hours to solve...

242
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,479
my puzzle, Sherlock...

243
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,439
or I'm going to be...

244
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,359
...so... naughty.

245
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,119
- So, who do you suppose it was?
- Hmm?

246
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,759
Woman on the phone - the crying
woman.

247
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,039
Oh, she doesn't matter, she's just
a hostage. No lead there.

248
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,239
For God's sake, I wasn't thinking
about leads.

249
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,679
You're not going to be much use to
her.

250
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,559
Are they trying to trace it -
trace the call?

251
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,239
- The bomber's too smart for that.

252
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,839
- Pass me my phone.
- Where is it?

253
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,879
Jacket.

254
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,519
Careful!

255
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,239
Text from your brother.

256
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,079
- Delete it.
- Delete it?

257
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,919
Missile plans are out of the
country now.

258
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,199
Nothing we can do about it.

259
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,759
Well, Mycroft thinks there is.
He's texted you eight times.

260
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,119
Must be important.

261
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,559
Then why didn't he cancel his
dental appointment?

262
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,759
His what?

263
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,599
Mycroft never texts if he can
talk.

264
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,039
Look, Andrew West stole the
missile plans, tried to sell them,

265
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,199
got his head smashed in for his
pains, end of story.

266
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,799
The only mystery is this -

267
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,239
why's my brother so determined to
bore me

268
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,319
when somebody else is being so
delightfully interesting?

269
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,279
Try and remember there's a woman
who might die.

270
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,359
What for? There's hospitals full
of people dying, Doctor.

271
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,399
Why don't you go and cry by their
bedside and see what good it does
them?

272
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,319
- Ah!

273
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,439
- Any luck?
- Oh, yes!

274
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:12,639
- Oh, sorry. I didn't...
- Jim, hi! Come in! Come in!

275
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,159
- Jim, this is Sherlock Holmes.
- Ah.

276
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,919
- And, er... Sorry.
- John Watson. Hi.

277
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,959
Hi. So, you're Sherlock Holmes.

278
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,879
Molly's told me all about you. You
on one of your cases?

279
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,759
Jim works in IT, upstairs.

280
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,879
- That's how we met. Office
romance.

281
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,919
Gay.

282
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,359
- Sorry, what?
- Nothing. Um, hey.

283
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,159
Hi.

284
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,159
- Sorry. Sorry!

285
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,119
Well, I'd better be off.

286
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,839
I'll see you at the Fox.

287
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,439
- About sixish?
- Yeah.

288
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,759
- Bye.
- Bye.

289
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,079
It was nice to meet you.

290
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,399
You too.

291
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,279
What do you mean, gay? We're
together.

292
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,959
And domestic bliss must suit you,
Molly.

293
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,159
You've put on three pounds since I
last saw you.

294
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,879
- Two-and-a-half.
- No, three.

295
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,799
- Sherlock.
- He's not gay!

296
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,599
- Why do you have to spoil...?
He's not!
- With that level of personal
grooming?

297
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,759
Because he puts a bit of product
in his hair? I put product in my
hair.

298
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,279
You wash your hair, there's a
difference.

299
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,759
No, no - tinted eyelashes, clear
signs of taurine cream around the
frown lines.

300
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,719
Those tired, clubber's eyes.

301
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,639
- Then there's his underwear.
- His underwear?

302
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,599
Visible above the waistline. Very
visible. Very particular brand.

303
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,559
Plus the extremely suggestive fact
that he just left his number under
this dish.

304
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,839
I'd say you'd better break it off
now and save yourself the pain.

305
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,479
- Charming, well done!

306
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,839
Just saving her time. Isn't that
kinder?

307
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,039
Kinder? No, no. Sherlock,
thatwasn't kind.

308
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,079
Go on, then.

309
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,679
Hm?

310
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,599
You know what I do. Off you go.

311
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,039
- Oh... No.
- Go on.

312
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,079
I'm not going to stand here so you
can humiliate me

313
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,159
- while I try and disseminate...
- An outside eye, a second
opinion.

314
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,599
- It's very useful to me.
- Yeah, right!

315
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,839
Really!

316
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,239
Fine.

317
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,159
Oh, they're just a pair of shoes.
Trainers!

318
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,679
Good.

319
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,319
Um...

320
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,799
They're in good nick. I'd say they
were pretty new,

321
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,319
except the sole has been well
worn, so the owner must have had
them for a while.

322
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,439
Er, very '80s. Probably one of
those retro designs.

323
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,799
You're on sparkling form. What
else?

324
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,719
They're quite big. A man's.

325
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,199
But...

326
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,999
But there's traces of a name
inside in felt-tip.

327
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,199
Adults don't write their names
inside their shoes, so these
belong to a kid.

328
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,479
Excellent. What else?

329
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,119
Er...

330
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,159
- That's it.
- That's it.

331
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,799
- How did I do?
- Well, John.

332
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,759
Really well.

333
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,839
I mean, you missed almost
everything of importance, but, you
know...

334
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,519
The owner loved these. Scrubbed
them clean.

335
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,959
Whitened them where they got
discoloured. Changed the laces
three...

336
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,879
no, four times. Even so, there are
traces of his flaky skin

337
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,279
where his fingers have come into
contact with them, so he suffered
from eczema.

338
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,279
The shoes are well worn, more so
on the inner side,

339
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,799
which means the owner had weak
arches.

340
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,359
British-made, 20 years old.

341
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,319
- 20 years?
- They're not retro, they're
original.

342
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,559
Limited edition - two blue
stripes, 1989.

343
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,279
There's still mud on them. They
look new.

344
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,119
Someone's kept them that way.

345
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,199
Quite a bit of mud caked on the
soles.

346
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,359
Analysis shows it's from Sussex
with London mud overlaying it.

347
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,599
How do you know?

348
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,239
Pollen. Clear as a map reference
to me. South of the river, too.

349
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,239
So, the kid who owned these
trainers came to London from
Sussex 20 years ago

350
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,479
- and left them behind.
- So, what happened to him?

351
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,319
Something bad.

352
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,039
He loved those shoes, remember.
He'd never leave them filthy.

353
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,079
Wouldn't let them go unless he had
to.

354
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,919
So, a child with big feet gets...

355
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,999
Oh!

356
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,279
What?

357
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,359
Carl Powers.

358
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,519
- Sorry, who?
- Carl Powers, John.

359
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,319
What is it?

360
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,879
It's where I began.

361
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,319
1989, young kid, champion
swimmer,

362
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,279
came up from Brighton for a school
sports tournament, drowned in the
pool.

363
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,719
Tragic accident. You wouldn't
remember it.

364
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,439
- Why should you?
- But you remember.

365
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,159
- Yes.
- Something fishy about it?

366
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,799
Nobody thought so.

367
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,359
Nobody except me.

368
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,559
I was only a kid myself. I read
about it in the papers.

369
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,079
- You started young, didn't you?
- The boy, Carl Powers,

370
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,959
had some kind of fit in the water,

371
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,439
but by the time they got him out,
it was too late.

372
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,839
There was something wrong
somewhere and I couldn't get it
out of my head.

373
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,399
- What?
- His shoes.

374
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,759
- What about them?
- They weren't there. I made a
fuss.

375
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,439
I tried to get the police
interested

376
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,479
but nobody seemed to think it was
important.

377
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,559
He'd left all the rest of his
clothes in his locker.

378
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,639
But there was no sign of his
shoes.

379
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,559
Until now.

380
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,679
Can I help?

381
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,119
I want to help.

382
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,199
- There's only five hours left.

383
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,999
It's your brother.

384
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,599
He's texting me now.

385
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,119
- How does he know my number?
- Must be a root canal.

386
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,919
- Look, he did say... national
importance.
- Hmm!

387
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,319
- How quaint!
- What is?

388
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,279
You are. Queen and country.

389
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,119
- You can't just ignore it.
- I'm not ignoring it.

390
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,759
Putting my best man onto it right
now.

391
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,799
Right, good!

392
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,439
Who's that?

393
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,039
John, how nice! I was hoping it
wouldn't be long. How can I help
you?

394
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,839
Thank you.

395
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,559
Um, I was wanting to...

396
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,759
Your brother sent me to collect
more facts

397
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,559
about the stolen plans - the
missile plans.

398
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,719
- Did he?
- Yes.

399
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,239
He's investigating now.

400
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,399
He's, er... investigating away.

401
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,319
Um, I just wondered what else you
could tell me about the dead man.

402
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,359
Er, 27. Clerk at Vauxhall Cross.

403
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,639
Ml6.

404
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,399
He was involved in the
Bruce-Partington Program in a
minor capacity.

405
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,159
Security checks A-OK. No known
terrorist affiliations or
sympathies.

406
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,919
Last seen by his fiancĂ©e 10.30
yesterday evening.

407
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,719
Lucy, love, I've got to go out.

408
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,719
I've got to see someone.

409
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,439
Westie!

410
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,719
He was found at Battersea, yes. So
he got on the train?

411
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,239
- No.
- What?

412
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,679
He had an Oyster card...

413
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,119
...but it hadn't been used.
- He must have bought a ticket.

414
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,679
- Hm. There was no ticket on the
body.
- Then...

415
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,519
Then how did he end up with a
bashed-in brain on the tracks at
Battersea?

416
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,959
That is the question -

417
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,599
the one I was rather hoping
Sherlock would provide an answer
to.

418
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,679
How's he getting on?

419
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,639
He's fine.

420
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,039
And it is going... very well.

421
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,519
He's, um... He's completely
focused on it.

422
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,439
- Poison!
- What are you going on about?

423
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,359
Clostridium botulinum.

424
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,679
It's one of the deadliest poisons
on the planet.

425
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,759
Carl Powers.

426
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,359
Are you saying he was murdered?

427
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,119
- Remember the shoelaces.
- Mmm.

428
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,599
The boy suffered from eczema. It
would be the easiest thing in the
world

429
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,759
to introduce the poison into his
medication.

430
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,119
Two hours later he comes up to
London,

431
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,359
the poison takes effect, paralyses
the muscles and he drowns.

432
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,879
How come the autopsy didn't pick
that up?

433
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,279
It's virtually undetectable.
Nobody would have been looking for
it.

434
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,639
There's still tiny traces of it
left inside the trainers

435
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,679
from where he put the cream on his
feet.

436
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,799
- That's why they had to go.
- So, how do we let the bomber
know?

437
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,559
Get his attention, stop the clock.

438
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,719
The killer kept the shoes all
these years.

439
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,519
Yes.

440
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,239
- Meaning...
- He's our bomber.

441
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,759
Well done, you.

442
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,559
Come and get me.

443
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,559
Where are you?

444
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,599
Tell us where you are.

445
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,879
She lives in Cornwall.

446
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,319
Two men broke in wearing masks,

447
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,919
forced her to drive to the car
park

448
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,159
and decked her out in enough
explosives to take down a house.

449
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,319
Told her to phone you.

450
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,639
Check the read-out from this -
pager.

451
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,079
If she deviated by one word, the
sniper would set her off.

452
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,799
- Or if you hadn't solved the
case.
- Oh... Elegant!

453
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,639
Elegant?

454
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,479
What was the point? Why would
anyone do this?

455
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,279
Oh... I can't be the only person
in the world that gets bored.

456
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,399
You have one new message.

457
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,919
Four pips.

458
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,999
First test passed, it would seem.

459
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,279
Here's the second.

460
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,679
- It's abandoned, wouldn't you
say?

461
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,319
I'll see if it's been reported.

462
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,159
Freak, it's for you.

463
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,359
Hello.

464
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,279
It's OK that you've gone to the
police.

465
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,919
Who is this?

466
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,759
Is this you again?

467
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,039
But don't rely on them.

468
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,839
Clever you.

469
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,039
Guessing about Carl Powers.

470
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,599
I never liked him.

471
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,799
- Carl laughed at me

472
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,919
so I stopped him laughing.

473
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,999
You've stolen another voice, I
presume.

474
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,479
This is about you and me.

475
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,479
Who are you? What's that noise?

476
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,119
It's the sounds of life, Sherlock.

477
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,519
But don't worry. I can soon fix
that.

478
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,479
You solved my last puzzle in nine
hours.

479
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,639
- This time you have eight.

480
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,999
Great!

481
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,919
We've found it.

482
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,239
The car was hired yesterday
morning by an lan Monkford. Banker
of some kind.

483
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,359
City boy. Paid in cash.

484
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,599
Told his wife he was going away on
a business trip and he never
arrived.

485
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,479
- You're still hanging round him.
- Yeah, well...

486
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,359
- Opposites attract, I s'pose.
- We're not...

487
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,719
You should get yourself a hobby.
Stamps, maybe. Model trains.
Safer.

488
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,359
Before you ask, yes, it's
Monkford's blood. DNA checks out.

489
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,719
- No body.
- Not yet.

490
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,519
Get a sample sent to the lab.

491
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,839
Oh!

492
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,719
Mrs Monkford...

493
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,599
Yes. Sorry, but I've already
spoken with two policemen.

494
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,399
We're not from the police,
we're...

495
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,839
Sherlock Holmes. Very old friend
of your husband's.

496
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,519
We, um...

497
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,959
We grew up together.

498
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,559
I'm sorry. Who?

499
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,399
I don't think he ever mentioned
you.

500
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,559
Oh, he must have done. This is...

501
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,559
This is horrible. I mean, I just
can't believe it.

502
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,479
I only saw him the other day.

503
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,999
Same old lan. Not a care in the
world.

504
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:58,319
Sorry... My husband has been
depressed for months. Who are you?

505
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,239
Really strange that he hired a
car.

506
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,519
Why would he do that? It's a bit
suspicious, isn't it?

507
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,839
No, it isn't. He forgot to renew
the tax on the car, that's all.

508
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,319
Ah, well! That was lan.

509
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,959
- That was lan all over.
- No, it wasn't.

510
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,679
Wasn't it? Interesting.

511
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,519
- Who was I talking to?
- Why did you lie to her?

512
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,919
People don't like telling you
things. They love to contradict
you.

513
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,479
Past tense, did you notice?

514
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,679
- Sorry, what?
- I referred to her husband

515
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,799
in the past tense. She joined in.
Bit premature.

516
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,639
- They've only just found the car.
- You think she murdered her
husband.

517
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,039
Definitely not. That's not a
mistake a murderer would make.

518
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,999
- I see... No, I don't. What am I
seeing?
- Fishing.

519
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,279
- Try fishing.
- Where now?

520
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,719
Janus Cars.

521
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,959
Just found this in the glove
compartment.

522
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,359
Can't see how I can help you
gentlemen.

523
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,279
Mr Monkford hired the car from you
yesterday.

524
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,319
Yeah, lovely motor. Mazda RX8.
Wouldn't mind one of them myself.

525
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,159
Is that one?

526
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,159
No, they're all Jags.

527
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,319
I can see you're not a car man,
eh!

528
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,799
But surely you can afford one - a
Mazda, I mean.

529
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,999
Yeah, that's a fair point. You
know how it is.

530
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,439
It's like working in a sweet shop.

531
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,439
Once you start picking up the
Liquorice Allsorts, when does it
all stop, eh?

532
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,959
- You didn't know Mr Monkford.
- No, he was just a client.

533
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,319
He came in here and hired one of
my cars.

534
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,479
I've no idea what happened to him.
Poor sod!

535
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,199
- Nice holiday, Mr Ewart?
- Eh?

536
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,959
- You've been away, haven't you?
- Oh, the... No, it's sunbeds, I'm
afraid.

537
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,959
Too busy to get away. My wife
would love it, though - bit of
sun.

538
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,679
Have you got any change for the
cigarette machine?

539
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,719
What?

540
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,999
I noticed one on the way in and I
haven't got any change. I'm
gasping.

541
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,039
Um... Oh!

542
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,839
No, sorry.

543
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,999
Oh, well! Thank you very much for
your time, Mr Ewart.

544
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,519
You've been very helpful. Come on,
John!

545
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,839
I've got change, if you still want
to...

546
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,879
Nicotine patches. Remember? I'm
doing well.

547
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,239
- So, what was all that about?
- I needed to look inside his
wallet.

548
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,479
- Why?
- Mr Ewart's a liar.

549
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,639
Hello.

550
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,439
The clue's in the name - Janus
Cars.

551
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,479
Why would you be giving me a clue?

552
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,759
Why does anyone do anything?

553
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,439
Because I'm bored.

554
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,199
We were made for each other,
Sherlock.

555
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,519
- Then talk to me in your own
voice.
- Patience.

556
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,279
How much blood was on that seat,
would you say?

557
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,039
How much? About a pint.

558
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,879
Not about. Exactly a pint. That
was their first mistake.

559
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,039
The blood's definitely lan
Monkford's, but it's been frozen.

560
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,559
- Frozen?
- There are clear signs.

561
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,799
I think lan Monkford gave a pint
of his blood some time ago

562
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,879
- and that's what they spread on
the seat.
- Who did?

563
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,319
Janus Cars. The clue's in the
name.

564
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,639
- The god with two faces?
- Exactly.

565
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,319
They provide a very special
service.

566
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,599
If you've got any kind of a
problem - money troubles,

567
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,239
bad marriage, whatever - Janus
Cars will help you disappear.

568
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,879
Lan Monkford was up to his eyes in
some kind of trouble -

569
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,559
financial at a guess, he's a
banker - couldn't see a way out.

570
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,159
But if he were to vanish, if the
car he hired

571
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,519
was found abandoned with his blood
all over the driver's seat...

572
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,199
- So where is he?
- Colombia.

573
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,519
- Colombia?!
- Mr Ewart, ofJanus Cars,

574
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,119
had a 20,000 Colombian peso note
in his wallet.

575
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,599
Quite a bit of change, too.

576
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,359
He told us he hadn't been abroad
recently,

577
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,159
but when I asked him about the
cars, I could see his tan line
clearly.

578
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,639
No-one wears a shirt on a sunbed.

579
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,599
- That, plus his arm.
- His arm?

580
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,879
He kept scratching it. Obviously
irritating him, and bleeding.

581
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,719
Why? Because he'd recently had a
boosterjab.

582
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,919
Hep-B, probably. Difficult to tell
at that distance.

583
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,359
Conclusion - he'd just come back
from settling lan Monkford

584
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,799
into his new life in Colombia.

585
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,919
Mrs Monkford cashes in the life
insurance, and she splits it with
Janus Cars.

586
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,399
- Mrs Monkford?
- Oh, yes. She's in on it too.

587
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,159
Now, go and arrest them,
Inspector, that's what you do
best.

588
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,479
We need to let our friendly bomber
know that the case is solved.

589
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,079
I am on fire!

590
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,879
He says...

591
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,719
you can come and fetch me.

592
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,199
Help!

593
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,599
Help me, please!

594
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,839
Feeling better?

595
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,999
To be honest, we've hardly stopped
for breath since this thing
started.

596
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,839
- Has it occurred to you...?
- Probably.

597
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,199
No, has it occurred to you that
the bomber's playing a game with
you?

598
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,519
The envelope, breaking into the
other flat,

599
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,559
the dead kid's shoes - it's all
meant for you.

600
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,879
Yes, I know.

601
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,399
Is it him, then? Moriarty?

602
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,919
Perhaps.

603
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,399
- That could be anybody.
- Well, it could be, yeah.

604
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,439
Lucky for you, I've been more than
a little unemployed.

605
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,959
- How d'you mean?
- Lucky for you,

606
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,639
Mrs Hudson and I watch far too
much telly.

607
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,999
...Thank you, Tyra! Doesn't she
look lovely, everybody, now?

608
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,599
Anyway...

609
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,039
Speaking of silk purses...

610
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,079
- Hello?
- This one...

611
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,919
is a bit...

612
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,479
...defective.

613
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,639
Sorry.

614
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,959
She's blind.

615
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,519
This is...

616
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,799
...a funny one.

617
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,199
I'll give you...

618
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,319
...12 hours.

619
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,599
Why are you doing this?

620
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,559
I like...

621
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,239
...to watch you...

622
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,359
dance.

623
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,759
...And I see you're back to your
bad habits.

624
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,959
...continuing into the sudden
death of the popular TV
personality

625
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,639
Connie Prince.

626
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,759
Miss Prince, famous for her
makeover programmes, was found
dead two days ago

627
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,359
by her brother in the house they
shared in Ham...

628
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,639
Connie Prince, 54, she had one of
those makeover shows on the telly.

629
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,759
- Did you see it?
- No.

630
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,039
- Very popular, she was going
places.
- Not any more.

631
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,439
So, dead two days.

632
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,319
According to one of her staff,
Raoul de Santos,

633
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,359
she cut her hand on a rusty nail
in the garden.

634
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,599
Nasty wound. Tetanus bacteria
enters the bloodstream,

635
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,479
good night, Vienna.

636
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,399
I s'pose.

637
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,999
Something's wrong with this
picture.

638
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,279
Eh?

639
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,719
Can't be as simple as it seems,

640
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,559
otherwise the bomber wouldn't be
directing us towards it.

641
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,959
Something's wrong.

642
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,399
- John?
- Mm.

643
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,759
Cut on her hand, it's deep. Would
have bled a lot, right?

644
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,759
- Yeah.
- But the wound's clean.

645
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,319
Very clean, and fresh.

646
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,399
How long would the bacteria have
been incubating inside her?

647
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,919
Ooh, eight, ten days.

648
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,399
The cut was made later.

649
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,799
- After she was dead?
- Must have been.

650
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,959
The only question is, how did the
tetanus enter the dead woman's
system?

651
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,119
- You want to help, right?
- Of course.

652
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,719
Connie Prince's background -
family history, everything, give
me data.

653
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,839
Right.

654
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,679
There's something else that we
haven't thought of.

655
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,279
- Is there?
- Yes. Why is he doing this, the
bomber?

656
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,159
If this woman's death was
suspicious, why point it up?

657
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,279
- Good Samaritan.
- Who press-gangs suicide bombers?

658
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,199
- Bad Samaritan.
- I'm... I'm serious, Sherlock.

659
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,999
Listen, I'm cutting you slack
here, I'm trusting you,

660
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,159
but out there somewhere, some poor
bastard's covered in Semtex

661
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,359
and he's just waiting for you to
solve the puzzle, so just tell me
-

662
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,999
what are we dealing with?

663
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,359
Something new.

664
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,959
Connection, connection,
connection. There must be a
connection.

665
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,759
Carl Powers, killed 20 years ago.

666
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,559
The bomber knew him, admitted that
he knew him.

667
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,839
The bomber's iPhone was in the
stationery from the Czech
Republic.

668
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,599
The first hostage from Cornwall,
the second from London,

669
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,199
the third from Yorkshire, judging
by her accent.

670
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,239
What's he doing? Working his way
round the world, showing off?

671
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,759
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

672
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,399
Joining the... dots.

673
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,159
Three hours.

674
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,639
Boom... boom.

675
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,679
We're devastated, of course we
are.

676
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,119
Can I get you anything, sir?

677
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,719
Er, no. No, thanks.

678
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,239
Raoul is my rock. I don't think I
could have managed.

679
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:15,679
We didn't always see eye to eye...
but my sister was very dear to me.

680
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,279
- And to the, er, public, Mr
Prince.

681
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,279
Oh, she was adored.

682
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,999
I've seen her take girls who
looked like the back end of
Routemasters

683
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,399
and turn them into princesses.

684
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,999
Still, it's a relief, in a way, to
know that she's beyond this veil
of tears.

685
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,679
- Absolutely.

686
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,719
Great.

687
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,319
Thank you. Thanks again.

688
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,759
It's a real shame. I liked her.

689
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,999
She taught you how to do your
colours.

690
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,919
- Colours?
- You know, what goes best with
what.

691
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,679
I should never wear cerise,
apparently.

692
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,239
- Drains me.
- Who's that?

693
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,999
- Home Office.
- Home Office?

694
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,879
Well, Home Secretary, actually.
Owes me a favour.

695
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,119
She was a pretty girl, but she
messed about with herself too
much.

696
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,599
They all do these days. People can
hardly move their faces.

697
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,959
It's silly, isn't it?

698
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,719
- Did you ever see her show?
- Not until now.

699
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,599
You lookpasty, love.

700
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,639
Ah, rained every day but one...

701
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,879
That's the brother. No love lost
there,

702
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,039
- if you can believe the papers.
- So I gather.

703
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,039
I've just been having a very
fruitful chat with people who love
this show.

704
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,119
- The fan site's indispensable for
gossip.
...really only one thing we can
do

705
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,039
with that ensemble, don't you
think, girls?

706
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:38,039
- Off, off, off, off, off, off,
off!

707
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,719
Yeah, it's more common than people
think.

708
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,599
The tetanus is in the soil,

709
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,279
people cut themselves on rose
bushes, garden forks, that sort of
thing,

710
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,799
if left un... treated...

711
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,799
- I don't know what I'm going to
do now.
- Right.

712
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,319
I mean, she's left me this
place... which is lovely...

713
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,399
...but it's not the same without
her.

714
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,919
That's why...

715
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,799
my paper wanted to get the,
erm... the full story straight from
the horse's mouth.

716
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,519
Are you sure it's not too soon?

717
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,719
- No.
- Right.

718
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,959
You fire away.

719
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,879
John.

720
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,439
Hi. Look, get over here quickly. I
think I'm onto something.

721
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,159
You'll need to pick up some stuff
first. Have you got a pen?

722
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,399
I'll remember.

723
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,519
- That'll be him.
- What?

724
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,039
- Ah, Mr Prince, isn't it?
- Yes.

725
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,239
- Very good to meet you.
- Yes, thank you.

726
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,799
- So sorry to hear about...
- Yes, yes, very kind.

727
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,479
Shall we, er...?

728
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,199
You were right, the bacteria got
into her another way.

729
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,839
- Oh, yes?
- Yes.

730
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,759
- Right, are we all set?
- Er, yes. Shall we, erm...?

731
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,159
Er, not too close. I'm raw from
crying.

732
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,439
- Oh, who's this?

733
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,359
Sekhmet. Named after the Egyptian
goddess.

734
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,559
How nice. Was she Connie's?

735
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,599
Yes, a little present from yours
truly.

736
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,879
Sherlock, light reading?

737
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,439
Oh, er...

738
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,319
- Bloody hell! What are you
playing at?
- Sorry!

739
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,119
You're like Laurel and bloody
Hardy, you two! What's going on?

740
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,559
Actually, I think we've got what
we came for. Excuse us.

741
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,079
- What?
- Sherlock.

742
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,719
- What?
- We've got deadlines.

743
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,679
But you've not taken anything!

744
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,359
Yes! Ooh, yes!

745
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,239
You think it was the cat. It
wasn't the cat.

746
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,119
What? Yes. Yeah, it is.

747
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,399
It must be. It's how he got the
tetanus into her system.

748
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,039
- Its paws stink of disinfectant.
- Lovely idea.

749
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,439
No, he coated it onto the claws of
her cat.

750
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,479
It's a new pet, bound to be a bit
jumpy around her.

751
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,519
A scratch is almost inevitable.
She wouldn't...

752
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,039
I thought of it the minute I saw
the scratches on her arm,

753
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,679
but it's too random and too clever
for the brother.

754
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,439
He murdered his sister for her
money.

755
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,639
- Did he?
- Didn't he?

756
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,479
Nope. It was revenge.

757
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,679
- Rev...? Who wanted revenge?
- Raoul, the houseboy.

758
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,319
Kenny Prince was the butt of his
sister's jokes week in, week out.

759
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,719
Virtual bullying campaign.
Finally, he had enough, fell out
with her badly.

760
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,439
It's all on the website.

761
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,519
She threatened to disinherit
Kenny, Raoul had grown accustomed

762
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,079
- to a certain lifestyle...
- Wait. Wait!

763
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,519
Wait a second. What about the
disinfectant, then, on the cat's
claws?

764
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,959
Raoul keeps a very clean house.
You came through the kitchen door,

765
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,639
saw the state of that floor -
scrubbed within an inch of its
life.

766
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,639
You smell of disinfectant. I know
the cat doesn't come into it.

767
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,879
Raoul's internet records do,
though. I hope we can get a cab
from here.

768
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,479
Raoul de Santos is your killer.

769
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,599
Kenny Prince's houseboy.

770
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,039
Second autopsy shows it wasn't
tetanus that poisoned Connie
Prince,

771
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,999
it was botulinum toxin.

772
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,799
We've been here before. Carl
Powers. Tut-tut.

773
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,479
- Our bomber's repeated himself.
- So how'd he do it?

774
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,359
- Botox injection.
- Botox?

775
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,919
Botox is a diluted form of
botulinum.

776
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,359
Among other things,

777
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,919
Raoul de Santos was employed to
give Connie her regular facial
injections.

778
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,359
My contact at the Home Office

779
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,879
gave me the complete records of
Raoul's internet purchases.

780
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,639
He's been bulk ordering Botox for
months.

781
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,519
Bided his time, then upped the
strength to a fatal dose.

782
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,199
- Are you sure about this?
- I'm sure.

783
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,919
All right, my office.

784
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,759
- Hey, Sherlock, how long?
- What?

785
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,439
- How long have you known?
- Well, this one was quite simple.

786
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,639
And like I said, the bomber
repeated himself. That was a
mistake.

787
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,599
No, but, Sherlock, the hostage,
the old woman, she's been there
all this time!

788
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,039
I knew I could save her. I also
knew that the bomber had given us
12 hours.

789
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,799
I solved the case quickly, that
gave me time to get on with other
things.

790
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,839
Don't you see? We're one up on
him.

791
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,759
Hello.

792
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,479
Help me!

793
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,639
Tell us where you are.

794
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,279
- Address?
- He was so...

795
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,119
His voice...

796
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,759
No, no, no, no! Tell me nothing
about him, nothing.

797
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,759
He sounded so soft.

798
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,839
Hello?

799
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,799
Sherlock?

800
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,319
What's happened?

801
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,679
The explosion,

802
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,599
which ripped through several
floors, killing 12 people...

803
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,879
- Old block of flats.
...caused by a faulty gas main.

804
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,079
A spokesman from the utility
company...

805
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:44,639
- He certainly gets about.
- Well, obviously I lost that
round.

806
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,519
Although technically, I did solve
the case.

807
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,799
He killed the old lady because she
started to describe him.

808
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,799
Just once, he put himself in the
firing line.

809
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,239
What d'you mean?

810
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,839
Well, usually, he... must stay
above it all.

811
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,639
He organises these things, but
no-one ever has direct contact.

812
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,919
What, like the Connie Prince
murder, he arranged that?

813
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,079
So, people come to him wanting
their crimes fixed up, like
booking a holiday?

814
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,159
Novel.

815
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,039
Huh!

816
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,039
Taking his time this time.

817
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,999
Anything on the Carl Powers case?

818
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,239
Nothing.

819
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,559
All the living classmates check
out spotless, no connection.

820
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,719
- Maybe the killer was older than
Carl?
- The thought had occurred.

821
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,359
So why is he doing this, then?

822
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,079
Playing this game with you. Do you
think he wants to be caught?

823
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,519
- I think he wants to be
distracted.
- Oh...

824
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,479
I hope you'll be very happy
together.

825
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:04,959
- Sorry, what?
- There are lives at stake,
Sherlock.

826
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,079
Actual human lives! Just so I
know,

827
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,239
- do you care about that at all?
- Will caring about them help save
them?

828
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,319
Nope.

829
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,639
Then I'll continue not to make
that mistake.

830
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,079
- And you find that easy, do you?
- Yes, very.

831
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:18,759
- Is that news to you?
- No, no.

832
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,359
I've disappointed you.

833
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,719
That's good, that's a good
deduction, yeah.

834
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,639
Don't make people into heroes,
John.

835
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,959
Heroes don't exist, and if they
did, I wouldn't be one of them.

836
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,959
- Excellent.

837
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,839
A view of the Thames.

838
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,199
South Bank, somewhere between
Southwark Bridge and Waterloo.

839
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,239
You check the papers, I'll look
online.

840
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,239
Oh, you're angry with me, so you
won't help.

841
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,719
Not much cop, this caring lark.

842
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,439
- Archway suicide...
- Ten-a-penny.

843
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,519
Two kids stabbed in Stoke
Newington.

844
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:23,199
Ah, man found on the train line,
Andrew West.

845
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,719
Nothing!

846
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,639
It's me. Have you found anything
on the South Bank between Waterloo
Bridge

847
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,159
and Southwark Bridge?

848
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,599
Do you reckon this is connected,
then, the bomber?

849
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,279
Must be. Odd, though, he hasn't
been in touch.

850
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,599
Then we must assume that some poor
bugger's primed to explode, yeah?

851
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,959
Yes.

852
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,279
- Any ideas?
- Seven, so far.

853
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,799
Seven?

854
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,759
He's dead about 24 hours.

855
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,279
Maybe a bit longer. Did he drown?

856
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,599
Apparently not. Not enough of the
Thames in his lungs, asphyxiated.

857
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,199
Yes, I'd agree.

858
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,519
There's quite a bit of bruising
around the nose and mouth.

859
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,319
More bruises...

860
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,599
here and here.

861
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,839
Fingertips.

862
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,839
He's late 30s, I'd say, not in the
best condition.

863
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,639
He's been in the river a long
while, the water's destroyed most
of the data.

864
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,719
But I'll tell you one thing, that
lost Vermeer painting's a fake.

865
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,799
- What?
- We need to identify the corpse,

866
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,319
find out about his friends and...

867
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,799
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What
painting? What are you on about?

868
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,959
It's all over the place, haven't
you seen the posters?

869
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,599
Dutch old master, supposed to have
been destroyed centuries ago.

870
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,199
Now it's turned up, worth Â£30
million.

871
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,919
OK, so what has that got to do
with the stiff?

872
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,559
Everything.

873
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,319
- Have you ever heard of the
Golem?
- Golem?

874
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,799
It's a horror story, isn't it?
What are you saying?

875
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,759
Jewish folk story, a gigantic man
made of clay, it's also the name
of an assassin.

876
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,919
Real name - Oskar Dzundza. One of
the deadliest assassins in the
world.

877
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,879
That is his trademark style.

878
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,799
- So this is a hit?
- Definitely.

879
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,039
The Golem squeezes the life out of
his victims with his bare hands.

880
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,879
But what has this got to do with
that painting? I don't see...

881
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,559
You do see, you just don't
observe!

882
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,279
Yes, all right, all right, girls!
Calm down.

883
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,559
Sherlock, do you want to take us
through it?

884
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,159
What do we know about this corpse?

885
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,679
The killer's not left us with
much, just the shirt and the
trousers.

886
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,919
They're pretty formal, maybe he
was going out for the night.

887
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,879
The trousers are heavy duty.
Polyester, nasty, same as the
shirt, cheap.

888
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,679
They're both too big for him. So
some kind of standard-issue
uniform.

889
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,439
Dressed for work, then. What kind
of work?

890
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,239
There's a hook on his belt... for
a walkie-talkie.

891
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,039
Tube driver?

892
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,719
- Security guard?
- More likely.

893
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,799
- That'll be borne out by his
backside.
- Backside?!

894
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,039
Flabby, you'd think he led a
sedentary life.

895
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:40,599
Yet the soles of his feet and the
nascent varicose veins in his legs
show otherwise.

896
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,359
So, a lot of walking anda lot of
sitting around.

897
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,799
Security guard's looking good. The
watch helps too.

898
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,879
The alarm shows he did regular
night shifts.

899
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,519
Why regular? Maybe he set his
alarm like that the night before
he died?

900
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,759
No, no, no. The buttons are stiff,
hardly touched.

901
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,279
He set his alarm like that a long
time ago, his routine never
varied.

902
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,039
But there's something else. The
killer must have been interrupted,

903
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,679
otherwise he would have stripped
the corpse completely.

904
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,839
There was some kind of badge or
insignia on the shirt front

905
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,119
that he tore off, suggesting the
dead man works somewhere
recognisable,

906
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,759
some kind of institution.

907
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,519
I found this inside his trouser
pockets.

908
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:15,319
Sodden by the river, but still
recognisably...

909
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,759
- Tickets?
- Ticket stubs.

910
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,599
He worked in a museum or gallery.
Did a quick check.

911
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,319
The Hickman Gallery has reported
one of its attendants as missing,

912
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,839
Alex Woodbridge.

913
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,719
Tonight, they unveil the
rediscovered masterpiece.

914
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,919
Now, why would anyone want to pay
the Golem

915
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,119
to suffocate a perfectly ordinary
gallery attendant?

916
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,319
Inference, the dead man knew
something about it,

917
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,319
something that would stop the
owner getting paid Â£30 million.

918
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,119
- The pictures are fake.
- Fantastic.

919
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,919
- Meretricious.
- And a Happy New Year.

920
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,479
Poor sod.

921
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,519
I'd better get my feelers out for
this Golem character.

922
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,079
Pointless, you'll never find him,
but I know a man who can.

923
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,279
- Who?
- Me.

924
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,199
Why hasn't he phoned? He's broken
his pattern. Why?

925
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,119
- Waterloo Bridge.
- Where now, the gallery?

926
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,999
In a bit.

927
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,959
The Hickman's contemporary art,
isn't it?

928
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,599
Why have they got hold of an old
master?

929
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,679
Don't know. Dangerous to jump to
conclusions.

930
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,119
Need data...

931
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,399
Stop!

932
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,599
Can you wait here?

933
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,679
I won't be a moment.

934
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,199
Sherlock?

935
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,879
Change? Any change?

936
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,759
- What for?
- Cup of tea, of course.

937
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,079
Here you go, a 50.

938
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,799
Thanks.

939
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,079
- What are you doing?
- Investing.

940
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,999
Now we go to the gallery.

941
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,519
Have you got any cash?

942
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,359
No, I need you to find out all you
can about the gallery attendant.

943
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,279
- Lestrade will give you the
address.
- OK.

944
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,759
We'd been sharing about a year.

945
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,439
- Just sharing.
- Mmm.

946
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,319
- May I?
- Yeah.

947
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,159
Sorry.

948
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,879
Stargazer, was he?

949
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,719
God, yeah. Mad about it.

950
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,439
It's all he ever did in his spare
time.

951
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,919
He was a nice guy, Alex.

952
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,879
I liked him.

953
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,279
He was, er...

954
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,439
never much of a one for hoovering.

955
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,679
What about art? Did he know
anything about that?

956
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,239
It was just a job, you know?

957
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,439
Mmm.

958
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,439
Has anyone else been round asking
about Alex?

959
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,719
No.

960
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,119
We had a break-in, though.

961
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,999
- When?
- Last night.

962
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,079
There was nothing taken.

963
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:57,999
Oh, there was a message left for
Alex on the land line.

964
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,319
- Who was it from?
- I can play it for you, if you
like.

965
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,599
- I'll get the phone...
- Please.

966
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,279
Oh, should I speak now? Alex?

967
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,039
Love, it's Professor Cairns.

968
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:16,079
Listen, you were right. You were
bloody right.

969
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,319
Give us a call when...

970
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,119
Professor Cairns?

971
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,239
- No idea, sorry.
- Mmm.

972
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,519
Can I try and ring back?

973
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:30,199
No good. I've had other calls
since. Sympathy ones, you know.

974
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,079
Don't you have something to do?

975
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,039
Just admiring the view.

976
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,759
Yes.

977
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,359
Lovely. Now go back to work - we
open tonight.

978
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,039
- Doesn't it bother you?
- What?

979
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,399
That the painting's a fake.

980
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,559
- What?
- It's a fake. It has to be.

981
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,279
It's the only possible
explanation.

982
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,559
You are in charge, aren't you,
Miss Wenceslas?

983
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,799
Who are you?

984
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,919
Alex Woodbridge knew that the
painting was a fake,

985
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,799
so somebody sent the Golem to take
care of him. Was it you?

986
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,759
Golem? What the hell are you
talking about?

987
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,519
Are you working for someone else?
Did you fake it for them?

988
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,039
It's not a fake.

989
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,799
It is a fake.

990
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,079
I don't know why. But there's
something wrong with it, there has
to be.

991
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,799
What the hell are you on about?
You know I could have you

992
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,119
- sacked on the spot.
- Not a problem.

993
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,919
- No?
- No, I don't work here, you see.

994
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,239
Just popped in to give you a bit
of friendly advice.

995
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,959
How did you get in?

996
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,119
- Please!
- I want to know.

997
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,439
The art of disguise is knowing how
to hide in plain sight.

998
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,359
- Who are you?
- Sherlock Holmes.

999
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,799
Am I supposed to be impressed?

1000
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,999
You should be.

1001
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,599
Have a nice day.

1002
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,959
He wouldn't. He just wouldn't.

1003
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,319
- Stranger things have happened.
- Westie wasn't a traitor.

1004
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,039
It's a horrible thing to say!

1005
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,919
I'm sorry. But you must
understand...

1006
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,559
That's what they think, isn't it,
his bosses?

1007
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,199
He was young man, about to get
married, he had debts.

1008
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,359
Everyone's got debts,

1009
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,239
and Westie wouldn't want to clear
them by selling out his country.

1010
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:39,559
Can you, erm...? Can you tell me
exactly what happened that night?

1011
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,679
We were having a night in.

1012
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,999
Just... watching a DVD.

1013
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:49,119
He normally falls asleep, you
know, but he sat through this one.

1014
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,519
He was quiet.

1015
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,959
Out of the blue he said he just
had to go and see someone.

1016
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,519
And you've no idea who?

1017
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,879
Hi, Liz. You OK, love?

1018
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,039
- Yeah.
- Who's this?

1019
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,679
- John Watson, hi.
- This is my brother, Joe.

1020
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,919
John's trying to find out what
happened to Westie, Joe.

1021
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,239
- You with the police?
- Sort of, yeah.

1022
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,159
Tell them to get off their arses,
will you? It's bloody ridiculous.

1023
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,679
I'll do my best.

1024
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,879
Well, er,

1025
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:36,719
thanks very much for your help.
Again, I'm very, very sorry.

1026
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,359
He didn't steal those things, Mr
Watson.

1027
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,719
I knew Westie, he was a good man.

1028
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,239
He was my good man.

1029
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,319
- Spare change?
- No.

1030
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,759
Any spare change?

1031
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,079
Alex Woodbridge didn't know
anything special about art.

1032
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,719
- And?
- And...

1033
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,279
Is that it? No habits, hobbies,
personality?

1034
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,559
Give us a chance. He was an
amateur astronomer.

1035
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,679
- Hold that cab.
- Spare change, sir?

1036
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,199
- Don't mind if I do.
- Can you wait here?

1037
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:42,319
Fortunately, lhaven't been idle.
Come on.

1038
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,919
Beautiful, isn't it?

1039
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:14,479
- I thought you didn't care
about...
- Doesn't mean I can't appreciate
it.

1040
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:18,279
Listen, Alex Woodbridge had a
message on the answerphone at his
flat.

1041
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,319
- A Professor Cairns.
- This way.

1042
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,719
Nice. Nice part of town.

1043
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,799
- Any time you want to explain?
- Homeless network.

1044
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,919
- Really is indispensable.
- Homeless network?

1045
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,519
My eyes and ears, all over the
city.

1046
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,359
Ah, that's... clever.

1047
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,279
- So you scratch their backs,
and...?
- Yes, then disinfect myself.

1048
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,039
Sherlock! Come on!

1049
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,999
What's he doing sleeping rough?

1050
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:09,359
Well, he has a very distinctive
look. He has to hide somewhere

1051
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,719
where tongues won't wag... much.

1052
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,919
- Oh...
- What?

1053
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,119
- I wish I...
- Don't mention it.

1054
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,879
No! No! No! No!

1055
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,719
It'll take us weeks to find him
again.

1056
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,319
Or not. I have an idea where he
might be going.

1057
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,239
- What?
- I told you,

1058
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,079
someone left Alex Woodbridge a
message.

1059
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,999
There can't be that many Professor
Cairns in the book. Come on.

1060
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,919
Jupiter, the fifth planet in our
solar system, and the largest.

1061
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:55,359
Jupiter is a gas giant. Planet
Earth would fit into it 11 times.

1062
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,439
Yes, we know that.

1063
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:05,359
- Titan is the largest moon...
- Come on, Neptune.

1064
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,479
Many are actually long dead...

1065
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:15,519
- Tom, is that you?
...exploded into supernovas.

1066
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:21,319
Discovered by Urbain Le Verrier in
1846...

1067
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:28,199
...composed mainly of hydrogen.

1068
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,079
Their light takes so long to reach
us...

1069
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:33,479
- Golem!
...many are actually long dead,

1070
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,719
exploded into...

1071
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,199
I can't see him.

1072
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:43,999
- I'll go round.
- Who are you working for,
Dzundza?

1073
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,999
A star begins as a collapsing ball
of material

1074
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,159
- composed mainly of...
- Golem!

1075
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,079
Let him go...

1076
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,639
or I will kill you.

1077
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:15,199
The fourth planet of the solar
system, named after the Roman God
of War.

1078
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,799
...it is a gas giant...

1079
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,519
...takes so long to reach us...

1080
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,159
...into supernovas...

1081
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,639
...exploded into supernovas...

1082
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,479
- It's a fake. It has to be.
- That painting has been subjected
to

1083
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,039
- every test known to science.
- It's a very good fake, then.

1084
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,959
You know about this, don't you?
This is you, isn't it?

1085
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,639
Inspector, my time is being
wasted.

1086
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,839
Would you mind showing yourself
and your friends out?

1087
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,719
- The painting is a fake.

1088
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:13,199
It's a fake, that's why Woodbridge
and Cairns were killed.

1089
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,359
Oh, come on, proving it's just a
detail. The painting is a fake.

1090
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,319
I've solved it, I've figured it
out.

1091
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,679
It's a fake, that's the answer,
that's why they were killed.

1092
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,519
OK, I'll prove it. Give me time.
Will you give me time?

1093
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,879
- 10...
- It's a kid.

1094
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,039
- Oh God, it's a kid.
- What did he say?

1095
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,079
- 10.
- 9.

1096
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,199
He's giving me time.

1097
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,999
- Jesus...
- It's a fake, but how can I prove
it?

1098
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,959
- How?! How?!
- 8.

1099
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,079
This kid will die. Tell me why the
painting is a fake. Tell me!

1100
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,119
- 7.
- No, shut up.

1101
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,399
Don't say anything. It only works
if I figure it out.

1102
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,839
It must be possible. It must be
staring me in the face.

1103
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,399
- 6.
- How?

1104
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,639
Woodbridge knew, but how?!

1105
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:02,759
- 5.
- It's speeding up! Sherlock!

1106
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,719
- 4.
- In the Planetarium, you heard it
too.

1107
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,759
Oh, that is brilliant, that is
gorgeous!

1108
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,399
- 3.
- What's brilliant? What is?!

1109
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:09,679
This is beautiful.

1110
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,639
2.

1111
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,239
- Sherlock!
- The Van Buren Supernova.

1112
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:20,439
Please, is somebody there?
Somebody help me.

1113
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:24,839
There you go. Go and find out
where he is and pick him up.

1114
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,599
Van Buren Supernova, so-called.

1115
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,799
Exploding star. Only appeared in
the sky in 1858.

1116
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:36,839
So how could it have been...

1117
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,839
painted in the 1640s?

1118
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,559
- Oh...

1119
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,079
Oh.

1120
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,479
Oh, Sherl...

1121
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,919
You know, it's interesting.
Bohemian stationery,

1122
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,399
an assassin named after a Prague
legend, and you, Miss Wenceslas.

1123
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,479
This whole case has a distinctly
Czech feeling about it.

1124
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,999
Is that where this leads?

1125
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,719
What are we looking at, Inspector?

1126
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,439
Well, criminal conspiracy, fraud,

1127
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:14,719
accessory after the fact, at the
very least.

1128
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,079
The murder of the old woman, all
the people in the flat...

1129
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,479
I didn't know anything about that.

1130
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,159
All those things, please, believe
me.

1131
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:26,959
I just wanted my share.

1132
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,479
The 30 million.

1133
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,279
I found a little old man in
Argentina.

1134
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,119
A genius - I mean, really.

1135
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,039
Brushwork, immaculate.

1136
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,679
- Could fool anyone.
- Mmm.

1137
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,199
Well, nearly anyone.

1138
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,439
But I didn't know how to go about
convincing the world

1139
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,919
the picture was genuine.

1140
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,719
It was just an idea.

1141
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,879
A spark which he blew into a
flame.

1142
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,639
Who?

1143
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,159
I don't know.

1144
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,799
- It's true!

1145
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,479
It took a long time, but
eventually I was...

1146
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,279
put in touch with people.

1147
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,959
His people...

1148
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,719
Well, there was never any real
contact.

1149
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:30,599
Just messages...

1150
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:35,719
...whispers.

1151
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,999
And did those whispers have a
name?

1152
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,959
Moriarty.

1153
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,919
- So this is where West was found?
- Yeah.

1154
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,239
- Are you going to be long?
- I might be.

1155
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,239
- Are you the police, then?
- Sort of.

1156
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,079
- I hate 'em.
- The police?

1157
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,679
No, jumpers.

1158
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,399
People who chuck 'emselves in
front of trains. Selfish bastards.

1159
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,199
Well, that's one way of looking at
it.

1160
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,679
I mean it. It's all right for
them.

1161
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,639
It's over in a split second,
strawberry jam all over the lines.

1162
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,679
What about the drivers, eh?

1163
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,839
They've got to live with it,
haven't they?

1164
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,799
Yeah, speaking of strawberry jam,
there's no blood on the line.

1165
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,479
- Has it been cleaned off?
- No, there wasn't that much.

1166
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,999
You said his head was smashed in.

1167
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,039
It was, but there wasn't much
blood.

1168
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,599
- OK.
- Well, I'll leave you to it,
then.

1169
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:52,999
- Just give us a shout when you're
off.
- Right.

1170
01:12:53,040 --> 01:13:00,799
Right, so, Andrew West... got on
the train somewhere. Or did he?

1171
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:03,519
There was no ticket on the body.

1172
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,919
How did he end up here?

1173
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,839
- The points.
- Yes!

1174
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:18,079
I knew you'd get there eventually.

1175
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,679
West wasn't killed here, that's
why there was so little blood.

1176
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,999
- How long have you been following
me?
- Since the start.

1177
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,879
You don't think I'd give up on a
case like this

1178
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,759
just to spite my brother, do you?

1179
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,239
Come on, we've got a bit of
burglary to do.

1180
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,559
Missile defence plans haven't left
the country,

1181
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,159
otherwise Mycroft's people would
have heard about it.

1182
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,519
Despite what people think, we do
still have a secret service.

1183
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,719
Yeah, I know, I've met them.

1184
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,279
Which means whoever stole the
memory stick can't sell it

1185
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,879
or doesn't know what to do with
it.

1186
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,839
My money's on the latter.

1187
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,399
We're here.

1188
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,039
Where?

1189
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,119
Sherlock! What if there's someone
in?

1190
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,839
There isn't.

1191
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:14,879
Jesus...

1192
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,039
- Where are we?
- Oh, sorry, didn't I say?

1193
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,639
Joe Harrison's flat.

1194
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,159
Joe...?

1195
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,239
Brother of West's fiancĂ©e. He
stole the memory stick,

1196
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,599
killed his prospective
brother-in-law.

1197
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,719
Then why did he do it?

1198
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,199
Let's ask him.

1199
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,959
Don't! Don't.

1200
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,159
He wasn't meant to...

1201
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,879
What's Lucy gonna say? Jesus.

1202
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,199
Why did you kill him?

1203
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:18,359
It was an accident. I swear it
was.

1204
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,759
But stealing the plans for the
missile defence program

1205
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,319
wasn't an accident, was it?

1206
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,519
I started dealing drugs.

1207
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,399
I mean, the bike thing's a great
cover, right?

1208
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,959
I don't know how it started.

1209
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,319
I just got out of my depth.

1210
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:38,799
I owed people thousands. Serious
people.

1211
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:43,479
Then at Westie's engagement do, he
starts talking about his job.

1212
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:48,519
I mean, usually, he's so careful.

1213
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:53,439
But that night, after a few pints,
he really opened up.

1214
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,679
He told me about these missile
plans.

1215
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:58,359
Beyond top secret.

1216
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,239
He showed me the memory stick, he
waved it in front of me.

1217
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,999
You hear about these things
getting lost,

1218
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,079
ending up on rubbish tips and
whatnot.

1219
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,399
But there it was. And I thought...

1220
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:13,439
Well, I thought it could be worth
a fortune.

1221
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:16,519
It was pretty easy to get the
thing off him, he was so
plastered.

1222
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,319
Next time I saw him,

1223
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,639
I could tell by the look on his
face that he knew.

1224
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:28,639
- What are you doing here?
- What have you done with the
plans?

1225
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,239
What happened?

1226
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:40,479
I was going to call an ambulance,
but it was too late.

1227
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,319
I just didn't have a clue what to
do.

1228
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,919
So I dragged him in 'ere.

1229
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:49,159
I just sat in the dark, thinking.

1230
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,599
When a neat little idea popped
into your head.

1231
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:36,159
Carrying Andrew West way away from
here.

1232
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,839
His body would have gone on for
ages

1233
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,919
if the train hadn't hit a stretch
of track with curves.

1234
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,079
- And points.
- Exactly.

1235
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,279
Do you still have it, then - the
memory stick?

1236
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,839
Fetch it for me, if you wouldn't
mind.

1237
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,279
Distraction over - the game
continues.

1238
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:07,959
Maybe that's over, too. We've
heard nothing from the bomber.

1239
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,439
Five pips, remember, John.

1240
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:13,279
It's a countdown. We've only had
four.

1241
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:21,479
No, no, no! Course he's not the
boy's father.

1242
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,719
Look at the turn-ups on his jeans!

1243
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,999
- I knew it was dangerous.
- Hm?

1244
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,199
Getting you into crap telly.

1245
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,919
Not a patch on Connie Prince.

1246
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,959
Have you given Mycroft the memory
stick yet?

1247
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,359
Yep. He was over the moon.

1248
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:41,199
Threatened me with a
knighthood... again.

1249
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,919
- You know, I'm still waiting.
- Hm?

1250
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,879
For you to admit that a little
knowledge of the solar system

1251
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,519
and you'd have cleared up the fake
painting a lot quicker.

1252
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,079
It didn't do you any good, did it?

1253
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,679
No, but I'm not the world's only
consulting detective.

1254
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,359
- True.
- I won't be in for tea.

1255
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,439
I'm going to Sarah's. There's
still some of that risotto left in
the fridge.

1256
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,079
- Milk, we need milk.
- I'll get some.

1257
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,839
- Really?
- Really.

1258
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,719
- And some beans, then?
- Mm.

1259
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,799
Bought you a little
getting-to-know-you present.

1260
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:29,319
That's what it's all been for,
isn't it?

1261
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,279
All your little puzzles, making me
dance.

1262
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,679
All to distract me from this.

1263
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,279
Evening.

1264
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,839
This is a turn-up, isn't it,
Sherlock?

1265
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:03,039
- John! What the hell...?
- Bet you never saw this coming.

1266
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:16,479
What... would you like me to make
him say... next?

1267
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:21,399
Gottle o' gear, gottle o' gear,

1268
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,319
- gottle o' gear.
- Stop it.

1269
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:26,639
Nice touch, this. The pool,

1270
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,079
where little Carl dies.

1271
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:34,839
I stopped him. I can stop John
Watson, too.

1272
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:39,719
- Stop his heart.
- Who are you?

1273
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,879
I gave you my number.

1274
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,519
I thought you might call.

1275
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:04,119
Is that a British Army Browning
L9A1 in your pocket,

1276
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:07,719
or are you just pleased to see me?

1277
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:09,999
Both.

1278
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:15,599
Jim Moriarty. Hi.

1279
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,919
Jim?

1280
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:22,079
Jim from the hospital?

1281
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,199
Oh, did I really make such a
fleeting impression?

1282
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:30,599
But then, I suppose, that was
rather the point.

1283
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:36,839
Don't be silly. Someone else is
holding the rifle.

1284
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,919
I don't like getting my hands
dirty.

1285
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:47,479
I've given you a glimpse,
Sherlock, just a teensy glimpse

1286
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:52,159
of what I've got going on out
there in the big bad world.

1287
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:55,519
I'm a specialist, you see.

1288
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,159
Like you.

1289
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,719
DearJim...

1290
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,839
...please will you fix it for me

1291
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:07,159
to get rid of my lover's nasty
sister?

1292
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:10,999
DearJim, please will you fix it
for me to disappear to South
America?

1293
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,599
Just so.

1294
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:15,719
Consulting criminal.

1295
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,559
- Brilliant.
- Isn't it?

1296
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,479
No-one ever gets to me.

1297
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,919
And no-one ever will.

1298
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,119
- I did.

1299
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,439
You've come the closest. Now
you're in my way.

1300
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:31,239
- Thank you.
- Didn't mean it as a compliment.

1301
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,439
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah, OK, I did.

1302
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,159
But the flirting's over, Sherlock.

1303
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,159
Daddy's had enough now.

1304
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,599
I've shown you what I can do.

1305
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:44,559
I cut loose all those people, all
those little problems,

1306
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:48,319
even 30 million quid, just to get
you to come out and play.

1307
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:52,519
So take this as a friendly
warning... my dear.

1308
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,239
Back off.

1309
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:00,599
Although I have loved this,

1310
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,439
this little game of ours.

1311
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,479
Playing Jim from IT.

1312
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,079
Playing gay. Did you like the
little touch with the underwear?

1313
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:10,919
- People have died.
- That's what people do!

1314
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:16,719
- I will stop you.
- No, you won't.

1315
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,159
Are you all right?

1316
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:22,239
You can talk, Johnny boy.

1317
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:24,639
Go ahead.

1318
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:28,399
- Take it.
- Mm? Oh...

1319
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,559
...that?

1320
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,799
The missile plans.

1321
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,279
Boring!

1322
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,359
I could have got them anywhere.

1323
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:46,319
- Sherlock, run!
- Good!

1324
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:49,559
Very good.

1325
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:53,719
If your sniper pulls that trigger,
Mr Moriarty, then we both go up.

1326
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:57,199
Isn't he sweet? I can see why you
like having him around.

1327
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:00,199
But then, people do get so
sentimental about their pets.

1328
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,079
They're so touchingly loyal.

1329
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,399
But oops!

1330
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:08,199
You've rather shown your hand
there, Dr Watson.

1331
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,039
Gotcha.

1332
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:24,199
Westwood. Do you know what happens
if you don't leave me alone,
Sherlock? To you?

1333
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:26,999
Oh, let me guess. I get killed.

1334
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,479
Kill you?

1335
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:32,959
No, don't be obvious. I mean, I'm
going to kill you anyway, some
day.

1336
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,799
I don't want to rush it, though.

1337
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,999
I'm saving it up for something
special.

1338
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:43,079
No, no, no, no, no. If you don't
stop prying, I'll burn you.

1339
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:50,079
I'll burn the heart out of you.

1340
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:54,799
I have been reliably informed that
I don't have one.

1341
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,879
But we both know that's not quite
true.

1342
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:04,079
Well, I'd better be off.

1343
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:07,359
Well, so nice to have had a proper
chat.

1344
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,239
What if I was to shoot you now?

1345
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,519
Right now?

1346
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:14,799
Then you could cherish the look of
surprise on my face.

1347
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,599
Cos I'd be surprised, Sherlock.

1348
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,359
Really, I would.

1349
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:23,959
And just a teensy
bit... disappointed.

1350
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,119
And of course, you wouldn't be
able to cherish it for very long.

1351
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:34,159
Ciao, Sherlock Holmes.

1352
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:40,479
Catch you... later.

1353
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:44,399
- No, you won't!

1354
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:52,239
All right? Are you all right?

1355
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:56,359
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Sherlock...

1356
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,239
Sherlock!

1357
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,479
Oh, Christ.

1358
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:20,439
- Are you OK?
- Me? Yeah, fine. I'm fine. Fine.

1359
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:26,839
That, er... thing that you... that
you did,

1360
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:32,359
that, um... you offered to do...
that was, um... good.

1361
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:37,839
- I'm glad no-one saw that.
- Mm?

1362
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,919
You ripping my clothes off in a
darkened swimming pool.

1363
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,039
People might talk.

1364
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,919
They do little else.

1365
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:55,919
- Oh...
- Sorry, boys. I'm so changeable!

1366
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:58,679
It is a weakness with me, but to
be fair to myself,

1367
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,479
it is my only weakness.

1368
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,359
You can't be allowed to continue.

1369
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,879
You just can't.

1370
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,479
I would try to convince you,

1371
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:12,399
but everything I have to say has
already crossed your mind.
