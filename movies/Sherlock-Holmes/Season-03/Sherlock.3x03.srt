1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,080
Mr Magnussen, please state your
full name for the record.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,040
Charles Augustus Magnussen.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,960
Mr Magnussen,

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,160
how would you describe your
influence over the Prime Minister?

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,720
The British Prime Minister?

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,800
Any of the British Prime Ministers
you have known.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,960
I never had the slightest
influence over any of them.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,440
Why would I?

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,697
I notice you've had seven meetings

10
00:00:25,698 --> 00:00:28,520
at Downing Street this year.

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,320
Why?

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,920
Because I was invited.

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,720
Can you recall the subjects
under discussion?

14
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,400
Not without being more indiscreet
than I believe is appropriate.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,880
Do you think it right that
a newspaper proprietor,

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,316
a private individual,

17
00:00:43,317 --> 00:00:45,640
and in fact a foreign national,

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,160
should have such regular access
to our Prime Minister?

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,800
I don't think it's wrong that
a private individual should

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,760
accept an invitation.

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,160
However, you have my sincere
apologies for being foreign.

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,240
That's not what I meant. That is
not in any way...

23
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,360
Mr Magnussen,
can you recall an occasion

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,920
when your remarks could have
influenced government policy?

25
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,600
Or the Prime Minister's
thinking in any way?

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,480
No.

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,680
Are you sure?

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,160
I have an excellent memory.

29
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,120
Your car is waiting outside...
See you tomorrow.

30
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,720
May I join you?

31
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,760
I don't think it's appropriate.

32
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,600
It isn't. Mr Magnussen, outside the
inquiry, we can have no contact,

33
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,040
no communication at all.

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,360
Please don't do that.

35
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,400
In 1982, your husband corresponded
with Helen Catherine Driscoll.

36
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,800
That was before I knew him.

37
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,360
The letters were lively, loving...

38
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,320
some would say explicit.

39
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,480
And currently in my possession.

40
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,400
Will you please move your hand?

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,320
"I long, my darling, to know
the touch of your... body."

42
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,320
I know what was in the letters.

43
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,760
She was 15.

44
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,480
She looked older.

45
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,240
Oh, she looked delicious.
We have photographs too.

46
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,880
The ones she sent him.

47
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,720
Yum-yum.

48
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,680
He was unaware of her age.

49
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,840
He met her only
once before the letters began.

50
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,720
When he discovered the truth,
he stopped immediately.

51
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,440
Those are the facts.

52
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,200
Facts are for history books.
I work in news.

53
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,880
Your hand is sweating.

54
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,640
Always, I'm afraid.
I have a condition.

55
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,960
It's disgusting.

56
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,720
I'm used to it.

57
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,800
The whole world is wet to my touch.

58
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,680
I will call someone,
I will have you removed.

59
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,080
What is that?

60
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,720
Claire de la Lune?

61
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,560
A bit young for you, isn't it?

62
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,120
You want to hit me now?
Could you, still?

63
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,960
Little old lady now.

64
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,720
Perhaps you should
settle for calling someone.

65
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,800
Well, go on.

66
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,200
No?

67
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,360
Because now there are consequences.

68
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,760
I have the letters
and therefore I have you.

69
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,440
This is blackmail.

70
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,000
Of course it isn't blackmail.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,320
This is...

72
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,480
ownership.

73
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,520
You do not own me.

74
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,720
Claire de la Lune.

75
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,160
It never tastes like it smells,
does it?

76
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,720
Lady Smallwood's bill is on me.
See to it.

77
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,120
Yes, Mr Magnussen.

78
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,320
Oh, God! Oh!

79
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,920
You all right, ma'am?

80
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,040
Fine, yes.

81
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,840
Magnussen!

82
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,800
No-one stands up to him.

83
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,120
No-one dares, no-one even tries.

84
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,160
There isn't a man or woman
in England capable of stopping

85
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,760
that disgusting creature...

86
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,000
Ma'am?

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,480
Turn the car around. We're going
back into town. Turn around.

88
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,920
Where are we going, ma'am?

89
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,080
Baker Street.

90
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,200
'You've seen a lot of injuries,
then? Violent deaths?'

91
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,600
'Enough for a lifetime.'
'Want to see some more?'

92
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,160
'Oh, God, yes.'

93
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,240
'The game is on.'

94
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,000
I know it's early.
Really, I'm sorry.

95
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,080
Is that Kate?
Yeah, it's Kate.

96
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,560
Invite her in?

97
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,600
Er, sorry, yes,
do you want to come in, Kate?

98
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,200
Hey!

99
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,520
It's hard.

100
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,240
There you go. It's Isaac.
Oh, your husband? Son. Son, yeah.

101
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,760
He's gone missing again.
Didn't come home last night.

102
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,000
The usual.

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,880
He's the drugs one, yeah?

104
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,000
Er, yeah, nicely put, John.

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,960
But is it Sherlock Holmes you want?
Because I've not seen him in ages.

106
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,040
About a month.
Who is Sherlock Holmes?

107
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,760
See, that does happen.

108
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,280
There's a place they all go to,
him and his friends.

109
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,240
They all do whatever they do.

110
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,560
Shoot up, whatever you call it.

111
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,172
Where is he?

112
00:07:51,173 --> 00:07:54,280
It's a house, it's a dump. It's practically falling down.

113
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,400
No, the address? Where, exactly?

114
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,800
Seriously? Why not?

115
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,160
She's not going to the police,
someone's got to get him.

116
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,400
Why you? I'm being neighbourly.
Since when?

117
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,040
Ha, since now.
Since this exact minute.

118
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,560
Why are you being so...? What?

119
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,360
I don't know,
what's the matter with you?

120
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,360
There is NOTHING the matter with me.

121
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,160
Imagine I said that without
shouting. I'm trying.

122
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,160
No, you can't come, you're pregnant.

123
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,760
You can't go, I'm pregnant!

124
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,880
What is that?!

125
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,000
It's a tyre lever. Why? Cos there
were loads of smackheads in there

126
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and one of them
might need help with a tyre.

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,520
If there's any trouble,
just go, I'll be fine.

128
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,320
John, John, John, John...

129
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,400
It is a tiny bit sexy.

130
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,880
Yeah, I know.

131
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,360
Hello?

132
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,160
What do you want? Excuse me.

133
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,960
Oh, no, you can't come in here!

134
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,480
I'm looking for a friend.
A very specific... friend.

135
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm not just browsing.

136
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,440
You've got to go.
No-one's allowed here.

137
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,280
Isaac Whitney, you seen him?

138
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,120
I'm asking you
if you've seen Isaac Whitney

139
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,560
and now you're showing me a knife.

140
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,960
Is it a clue? Are you doing a mime?

141
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,000
Go. Or I'll cut you.

142
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,520
Oh, not from there. Let me help.

143
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,160
Now, concentrate. Isaac... Whitney?

144
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,640
OK, you asked for it.

145
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,480
Agh! Ohh!

146
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,360
Right. Are you concentrating yet?

147
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,920
You broke my arm!

148
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,240
No, I sprained it.

149
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,920
It feels squishy.
Is it supposed to feel squishy?

150
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,000
Feel that! Yeah, it's a sprain.

151
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm a doctor,
I know how to sprain people.

152
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,120
Now where is Isaac Whitney?

153
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,240
I don't know! Maybe upstairs.

154
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,480
There you go. Wasn't that easy?

155
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,960
No, it was really sore.

156
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,480
Mental, you are!

157
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,240
No, just used to a better
class of criminal.

158
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,560
Isaac? Isaac Whitney?

159
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,920
Isaac?

160
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,080
Hello, mate. Sit up for me, sit up.

161
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,760
Dr Watson? Yep.

162
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,200
Where am I?

163
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,840
Arse-end of the universe with
the scum of the earth. Look at me.

164
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,240
Have you come for me?

165
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,920
Do you think
I know a lot of people here?

166
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,280
Hey, all right?

167
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,680
Oh, hello, John.
Didn't expect to see you here.

168
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,440
Come for me too?

169
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,720
Hello, Isaac. Mrs Watson,
can I, can I get in, please?

170
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,760
Yes, of course, get in. Where's
John? They're having a fight.

171
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,160
Who is?!

172
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,680
For God sakes, John, I'm on a case!

173
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,120
A month. That's all it took.

174
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,960
One! I'm working.

175
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,480
"Sherlock Holmes in a drug den."
How's that going to look?!

176
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,400
I'm undercover. No, you're not!

177
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,640
Well, I'm not now!

178
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,040
In, both of you, quickly!

179
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,840
Please, can I come?
I think I've got a broken arm.

180
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,440
No, go away. No, let him. Why?

181
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:32,360
Yeah, just get in. It's a sprain.

182
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,800
Anyone else? I mean, are we taking
everybody home, are we?

183
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,560
All right, Shezza?

184
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,720
"Shezza"? I WAS undercover!

185
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,240
Seriously, Shezza, though?

186
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,200
We're not going home, we're going to
Bart's. I'm calling Molly. Why?

187
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,400
Because Sherlock Holmes needs
to pee in a jar.

188
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,840
Well? Is he clean?

189
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,120
Clean?

190
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,320
How dare you throw away the
beautiful gifts you were born with!

191
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,440
And how dare you betray
the love of your friends!

192
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,720
Say you're sorry.

193
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,160
Sorry your engagement's over. Though I'm
fairly grateful for the lack of a ring.

194
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,520
Stop it. Just stop it!

195
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,960
If you were anywhere near this
kind of thing again,

196
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,240
you could have called,
you could have talked to me.

197
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,200
Please, do relax.
This is all for a case.

198
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
What kind of case would need
you doing this?

199
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,040
I might as well ask you why you've
started cycling to work?

200
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,000
No, we're not playing this game.

201
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,520
Quite recently, I'd say,
you're very determined about it.

202
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,720
Not interested. I am. Ow!

203
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,360
Oh, sorry, you moved,
but it is just a sprain.

204
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,880
Yeah, somebody hit me. Huh?

205
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,680
Yeah, just some guy.

206
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,760
Yeah, it was probably just
an addict in need of a fix.

207
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,440
Yes, I think in a way it was.

208
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,720
Is it his shirt? I'm sorry?

209
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,640
Well, it's the creases, isn't it?

210
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,960
The two creases down the front.

211
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,440
It's been recently folded,
but it's not new.

212
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,960
You must have dressed in a hurry
this morning.

213
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,280
So all your shirts must be
kept like that.

214
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,560
But why?

215
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,320
Maybe cos you cycle to work
every morning, shower

216
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,760
when you get there and then dress
in the clothes you brought with you.

217
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,480
You keep your shirts folded,
ready to pack.

218
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,880
Not bad.

219
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,400
And I further deduce...

220
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,200
...you've only started recently
because you've got a bit of chafing.

221
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,920
No, he's always walked like that.

222
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,560
Remind me, what's your name again?

223
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,280
They call me the Wig.
No, they don't.

224
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Well, they... they call me Wiggy.

225
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,400
Nope.

226
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,480
Bill. Bill Wiggins.

227
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,760
Nice observational skills, Billy.

228
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,560
Ah, finally!

229
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,760
Finally what? Good news?

230
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,320
Oh, excellent news, the best.

231
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,280
There's every chance that my drug
habit might hit the newspapers.

232
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,360
The game is on.
Excuse me... for a second.

233
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,240
You've heard of Charles Augustus
Magnussen, of course?

234
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,640
Yeah. Owns some newspapers.
Ones I don't read.

235
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,920
Hang on, weren't there other people?

236
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,160
Mary's taking the boys home,
I'm taking you, we did discuss it.

237
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,600
People were talking, none of them
were me, I must have filtered.

238
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,000
I noticed. I have to filter out
a lot of witless babble.

239
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,560
I've got Mrs Hudson
on semi-permanent mute.

240
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,440
What is my brother doing here?

241
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,640
So I'll just pay, then, shall I?

242
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,320
He's straightened the knocker.

243
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,760
He always corrects it, it's OCD,
doesn't even know he's doing it.

244
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,160
Why do you do that? Do what?
Nothing.

245
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,880
Well then, Sherlock,
back on the sauce?

246
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,920
What are you doing here?
I phoned him.

247
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,680
The siren call of old habits.
How very like Uncle Rudy.

248
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,886
Though in many ways, cross-dressing would have been a wiser path for you.

249
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:10,720
You phoned him.

250
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,080
Of course I bloody phoned him.
Of course he bloody did.

251
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,800
Now save me a little time -
where should we be looking?

252
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,640
"We"?
Mr Holmes?

253
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,800
For God's sake!

254
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,200
Anderson?! Sorry, Sherlock,
it's for your own good.

255
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,960
Oh, that's him, isn't it?
You said he'd be taller.

256
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,560
Some members of your little fan
club. Do be polite.

257
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,200
They're entirely trustworthy
and even willing to search

258
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,360
through the toxic waste dump that
you are pleased to call a flat.

259
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,480
You're a celebrity these days,
Sherlock.

260
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,040
You can't afford a drug habit.

261
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,760
- I do not have a drug habit.
- Hey, what happened to my chair?

262
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,000
It was blocking my view to the
kitchen.

263
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,400
Well, it's good to be missed!

264
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,720
You were gone, I saw an opportunity.
No, you saw the kitchen.

265
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,680
What have you found so far?
Clearly, nothing.

266
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,280
There's nothing to find!

267
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,200
Your bedroom door is shut.
You haven't been home all night.

268
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,440
So, why would a man who has never
knowingly closed a door without

269
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,760
the direct orders of his mother
bother to do so on this occasion?

270
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,920
OK, stop, just stop! Point made.

271
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,400
Jesus, Sherlock!

272
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,040
I shall have to phone our parents,
of course. In Oklahoma.

273
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,760
It won't be the first time that
your substance abuse

274
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,240
has wreaked
havoc with their line dancing.

275
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,520
This is not what you think.
This is for a case.

276
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,640
What case could possibly
justify this?

277
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,560
Magnussen.

278
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,000
Charles Augustus Magnussen.

279
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,120
That name you think you may have
just heard, you were mistaken.

280
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,560
If you ever mention hearing that
name in this room,

281
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,240
in this context,
I guarantee you, on behalf

282
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,160
of the British Security Services,
that materials will be found on

283
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,120
your computer hard-drives, resulting
in your immediate incarceration.

284
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,960
Don't reply, just look frightened
and scuttle.

285
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,160
I hope I won't have to
threaten you as well.

286
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,120
Well, I think we'd both find
that embarrassing.

287
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,720
Magnussen is not your business.

288
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,132
Oh, you mean he's yours? You may

289
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:11,720
consider him under my protection.

290
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,480
I consider you under his thumb.

291
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,400
If you go against Magnussen,

292
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,640
then you will find yourself
going against me.

293
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,960
OK. I'll let you know if I notice.

294
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,840
Um, what was I going to say?
Oh, yeah.

295
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,440
Bye-bye.

296
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,680
Unwise, brother mine.

297
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,880
Ohh! Ugh!

298
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,040
Brother mine...

299
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,840
...don't appal me when I'm high.

300
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,680
Mycroft, don't say another word,
just go.

301
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,040
He could snap you in two
and right now,

302
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,640
I'm slightly worried that he might.

303
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,680
Don't speak, just leave.

304
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,160
Oh.

305
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,280
Er, Magnussen?

306
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,200
What time is it? About eight.

307
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,840
I'll be meeting him in three hours.
I need a bath.

308
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,605
It's for a case, you say? Yep.

309
00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:12,840
What sort of case?

310
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,640
Too big and dangerous for any sane
individual to get involved in.

311
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,400
You trying to put me off? God, no.

312
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,720
Trying to recruit you.

313
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,040
And stay out of my bedroom.

314
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,560
Oh, John, hi. How are you?

315
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,680
Janine?

316
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,840
Sorry, not dressed.
Has everybody gone?

317
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,240
I heard shouting.
Yes, they're gone.

318
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,400
God, look at the time. I'll be late.

319
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,520
It sounded like an argument.
Was it Mike? Mike?

320
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,640
Mike, yeah. His brother, Mike.
They're always fighting.

321
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,880
Mycroft.

322
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,440
Do people actually call him that?

323
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,640
Yeah. Huh!

324
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,760
Oh, could you be a love
and put some coffee on?

325
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,200
Sure, right, yeah.

326
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,840
Thanks. Oh, how is Mary?
How's married life?

327
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,360
She's fine. We're both fine. Yeah.

328
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,320
Oh, it's over there now.
Where's Sherl?

329
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,400
(Sherl!)

330
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,280
Er, he's just having a bath.
I'm sure he'll be out in a minute.

331
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,240
Oh, like he ever is! Yeah.

332
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,120
Morning. Room for a little one?

333
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,400
Morning.

334
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,560
Ooh!

335
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,520
So, it's just a guess, but you've
probably got some questions?

336
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,880
Yeah, one or two. Pretty much.

337
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,280
Naturally.

338
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,560
You have a girlfriend? Yes, I have.

339
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,200
Now, Magnussen.
Magnussen is like a shark.

340
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000
It's the only way
I can describe him.

341
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,920
Have you ever been to the shark tank at the London
Aquarium, John? Stood up close to the glass?

342
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:00,360
Those floating, flat faces,
those dead eyes. That's what he is.

343
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,880
I've dealt with murderers,
psychopaths,

344
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,160
terrorists, serial killers.

345
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,000
None of them can turn my stomach
like Charles Augustus Magnussen.

346
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,120
Yes, you have?

347
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,480
Sorry, what?

348
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,600
You have a girlfriend? What? Yes,
yes, I'm going out with Janine.

349
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,400
I thought that was fairly obvious.
Yes. Well, yes.

350
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,280
You... You... You are
in a relationship?

351
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,080
Yes, I am.

352
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,920
You and Janine? Hmm.
Yes, me and Janine.

353
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,040
Care to elaborate?

354
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,840
Well, we're in a good place.
It's, um...

355
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,120
very affirming.
You got that from a book.

356
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,520
Everyone got that from a book.

357
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,280
OK, you two bad boys.
Behave yourselves.

358
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,480
You, Sherl, you're going to have to
tell me where you were last night.

359
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,400
Working. Working? Of course.

360
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,560
I'm the only one who really knows
what you're like, remember?

361
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,280
Well, don't you go letting on.

362
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,920
I might just, actually.

363
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
I haven't told Mary about this.

364
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,240
I kind of wanted to surprise her.
Yeah, I think you probably will.

365
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,760
But we should have you two
over for dinner, really soon.

366
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah. My place though,
not the scuzz-dump.

367
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,920
Great, yeah.

368
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,600
Dinner, yeah.

369
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,040
I'd better dash. It was
brilliant to see you. You too.

370
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,080
Have a lovely day. Call me later.

371
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,920
I might do. I might call you.

372
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,960
Unless I meet someone prettier.

373
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,760
Solve me a crime, Sherlock Holmes.

374
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,560
You know Magnussen
as a newspaper owner,

375
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,280
but he is so much more than that.

376
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,840
He uses his power and wealth
to gain information.

377
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,880
The more he acquires,
the greater his wealth and power.

378
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,440
And I'm not exaggerating when I say that he knows
the critical pressure point on every person of note

379
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,920
or influence in the whole of the
Western World and probably beyond.

380
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,560
He is the Napoleon of blackmail.

381
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,870
And he has created an unassailable

382
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:11,520
architecture of forbidden knowledge.

383
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,480
Its name...

384
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,280
is Appledore.

385
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,600
Dinner? Sorry, what dinner?

386
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,720
Me and Mary coming for dinner with...

387
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,360
wine and...

388
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,560
sitting.

389
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,480
Seriously? I have just told you that
the Western World is run

390
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,554
from this house and you want to talk about dinner?

391
00:22:30,555 --> 00:22:31,840
Fine. Talk about the house.

392
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,160
It is the greatest repository
of sensitive and dangerous

393
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,880
information anywhere in the world,

394
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,640
the Alexandrian Library
of secrets and scandals

395
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,760
and none of it is on a computer.

396
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,680
He's smart. Computers can be hacked.

397
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,480
It's all on hard copy, in vaults,
underneath that house.

398
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,160
And as long as it is,
the personal freedom of anyone

399
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,040
you've ever met is a fantasy.

400
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,960
That was the doorbell.
Couldn't you hear it?

401
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,920
It's in the fridge. It kept ringing.
Oh, that's not a fault, Sherlock!

402
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,640
Who is it?

403
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,080
Mr Holmes said you can go right up.

404
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,760
Oh. Go ahead.

405
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,520
Sir?

406
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,800
Can I have a moment?

407
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,120
He's fine.

408
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,120
Look, I... Right.
I should probably tell you...

409
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,720
OK, I...

410
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,800
There.

411
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,400
Doesn't mean I'm not
pleased to see you.

412
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,440
I can vouch for this man.
He is a doctor.

413
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,280
If you know who I am,
then you know who he is.

414
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,960
Don't you, Mr Magnussen?

415
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,200
I understood we were meeting
at YOUR office.

416
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,600
This is my office.

417
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,080
Well, it is now.

418
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,520
Mr Magnussen, I have been
asked to intercede with you

419
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,600
by Lady Elizabeth Smallwood

420
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,400
on the matter
of her husband's letters.

421
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,760
Some time ago you put pressure
on her concerning those letters.

422
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
She would like those letters back.

423
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,880
Obviously, the letters no longer
have any practical use to you,

424
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,520
so with that in mind...

425
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,080
Something I said?

426
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,960
No, no. I was reading.

427
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,840
There's rather a lot.

428
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,200
Redbeard?

429
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,480
Sorry. Sorry, you were
probably talking.

430
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,160
I...

431
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,040
I was trying to explain that I have
been asked to act on behalf of...

432
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,080
Bathroom?
Along from the kitchen, sir.

433
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,120
OK. I've been asked to negotiate
the return of those letters.

434
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,160
I am aware you do not make copies
of sensitive documents.

435
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,817
Is it like the rest of the flat?

436
00:25:13,818 --> 00:25:15,560
Sir? The bathroom?

437
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,440
Yes, sir. Maybe not then.

438
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,160
Am I acceptable to you
as an intermediary?

439
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,160
Lady Elizabeth Smallwood...

440
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,560
I like her.

441
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,640
Mr Magnussen,
am I acceptable to you

442
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,480
as an intermediary?

443
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,080
She's English with a spine.

444
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,120
Best thing about the English...

445
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,400
...you're so domesticated.

446
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,560
All standing around, apologising...

447
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,480
...keeping your little heads down.

448
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,440
You can do what you like here.
No-one's ever going to stop you.

449
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,960
A nation of herbivores.

450
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,520
I have interests
all over the world but...

451
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,320
everything starts in England.

452
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,720
If it works here...

453
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
...I try it in a real country.

454
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,880
The United Kingdom,

455
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,360
Petri dish to the Western World.

456
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,320
Tell Lady Elizabeth I might need
those letters so...

457
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,600
I'm keeping them.

458
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,880
Goodbye.

459
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,840
Anyway...

460
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,040
...they're funny.

461
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,360
Jesus!

462
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,320
Did you notice the one
extraordinary thing he did?

463
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,360
There was a moment that
kind of stuck in the mind, yeah.

464
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,760
Exactly. When he showed us
the letters.

465
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,400
OK. So, he's brought
the letters to London,

466
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,560
so no matter what he says,
he's ready to make a deal.

467
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,120
Now, Magnussen only makes a deal once he's established a person's weaknesses,

468
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,599
the pressure point, he calls it.

469
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,800
So, clearly he believes

470
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,720
I'm a drug addict
and no serious threat.

471
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,756
And of course, because he's in town tonight, the

472
00:27:19,757 --> 00:27:21,920
letters will be in his safe in his London office

473
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,120
while he's out to dinner with the Marketing
Group of GB from seven till ten.

474
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,000
How do you know his schedule? Because
I do. I'll see you tonight.

475
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,240
I've got some shopping to do.
What's tonight?

476
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,480
I'll text instructions.

477
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,080
Yeah, I'll text YOU if I'm available.
You are, I checked.

478
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,840
Don't bring a gun.
Why would I bring a gun?

479
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,000
Or a knife or a tyre lever. Probably
best not to do any arm-spraining,

480
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,519
but we'll see how the night goes. Are

481
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,080
you just assuming I'm coming along?

482
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,398
Time you got out of the house, John. You've put on

483
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,040
7lbs since you married and the cycling isn't doing it.

484
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,200
It's actually 4lbs. Mary and I
think seven. See you later.

485
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,880
And breaking news now.

486
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,520
John Garvie MP has been arrested
today on charges of corruption.

487
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,520
This follows an investigation...

488
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,960
Magnussen's office is on the top
floor, just below his private flat.

489
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,560
There are 14 layers of security
between us and him,

490
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,200
two of which aren't even
legal in this country.

491
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,256
Want to know how we're going to break in? Is that

492
00:28:31,257 --> 00:28:33,480
what we're doing? Of course it's what we're doing.

493
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,560
Magnussen's private lift.

494
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,120
Goes straight to his penthouse
and office. Only he uses it

495
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,320
and only his keycard calls the lift.

496
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,000
If anyone else even tries,
security is automatically informed.

497
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,320
Standard keycard for the building.

498
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,960
Nicked it yesterday. Only gets us
as far as the canteen.

499
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,502
Here we go then.

500
00:28:53,503 --> 00:28:55,800
If I was to use this card on that lift now,

501
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,840
what happens?

502
00:28:56,841 --> 00:28:59,400
Well, the alarms would go off

503
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,480
and you'd be dragged away
by security. Exactly.

504
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,120
Get taken to a small room somewhere
and your head kicked in.

505
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,960
Do we really need so much colour?
It passes the time.

506
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,760
But if I do this...

507
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,600
If you press a keycard against
your mobile phone for long enough,

508
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,160
it corrupts the magnetic strip.
The card stops working.

509
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,880
It's a common problem. Never put
your keycard with your phone.

510
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,680
What happens if I use the card now?

511
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,440
It still doesn't work.

512
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,920
But it doesn't read
as the wrong card now.

513
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,880
It registers as corrupted.

514
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,000
But if it's corrupted, how
do they know it's not Magnussen?

515
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,120
Would they risk dragging him off?
Probably not.

516
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,440
So, what do they do?
What do they have to do?

517
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,640
Check if it's him or not.

518
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,720
There's a camera at eye height
to the right of the door.

519
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,120
A live picture of the card user
is relayed directly

520
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,320
to Magnussen's personal staff
in his office,

521
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,080
the only people trusted
to make a positive ID.

522
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,040
At this hour,
almost certainly his PA.

523
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,040
So, how does that help us?

524
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,680
Human error.

525
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,800
I've been shopping.

526
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,280
Here we go then.

527
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,200
You realise you don't exactly
look like Magnussen?

528
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,960
Which in this case is
a considerable advantage.

529
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,920
Sherlock, you complete loon. What are
you doing?! Hang on, was that...?

530
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,480
Hi, Janine.

531
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,600
Go on, let me in.

532
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,880
I can't. You know I can't.
Don't be silly.

533
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,880
Don't make me do it out here.

534
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,280
Not in front of everyone.

535
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,000
Do what in front of everyone?

536
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,221
You see, as long as there's people, there's always a weak spot.

537
00:31:01,222 --> 00:31:02,040
That was Janine.

538
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Yes, of course it was.
She's Magnussen's PA.

539
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,968
That's the whole point.

540
00:31:04,969 --> 00:31:06,983
Did you just get engaged to break into an office?

541
00:31:06,984 --> 00:31:08,520
Yeah. Stroke of luck meeting her

542
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,040
at your wedding. You can take
some of the credit. Jesus!

543
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,960
Sherlock, she loves you.

544
00:31:13,961 --> 00:31:16,600
Yes. Like I said, human error.

545
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,320
What are you going to do? Well, not
actually marry her, obviously.

546
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,480
There's only so far you can go.
So, what will you tell her?

547
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,640
Well, I'll tell her that our entire
relationship was a ruse

548
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,040
to break into her boss's office.

549
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:31,440
I imagine she'll want to stop

550
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,160
seeing me at that point,
but you're the expert on women.

551
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,160
So, where did she go?

552
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,840
That's a bit rude.
I just proposed to her.

553
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,160
Sherlock.

554
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,240
Did she faint?

555
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,080
Do they really do that?!

556
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,120
It's a blow to the head.

557
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,760
She's breathing.

558
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,800
Janine?

559
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,040
Another in here.

560
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,280
Security.

561
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,520
Does he need help?

562
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,120
Ex-con. White supremacist
by the tattoos, so who cares?

563
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,240
Stick with Janine.

564
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,520
Janine, focus on my voice.
Can you hear me?

565
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,160
Hey, they must still be here.

566
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,040
So is Magnussen.
His seat's still warm.

567
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,000
He should be at dinner,
but he's still in the building.

568
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,669
Upstairs. We should call the police.

569
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,920
During our own burglary?

570
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,880
You're really not a natural
at this, are you?

571
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,520
No, wait. Sssh.

572
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,000
Perfume and not Janine's.

573
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,720
Claire de la Lune.
Why do I know it?

574
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,960
Mary wears it. No, not Mary.
Somebody else.

575
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,000
Sherlock!

576
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,200
What would your husband think?

577
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,440
Your lovely husband,
upright and honourable,

578
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,720
so English. What would
he say to you now?

579
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,480
No, no!

580
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,640
You're doing this to protect
him from the truth?

581
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,200
Well, is this the protection
he would want?

582
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,320
Additionally, if you're
going to commit murder,

583
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,120
you might consider changing
your perfume, Lady Smallwood.

584
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,040
Sorry. Who?

585
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,280
That's... not Lady Smallwood,
Mr Holmes.

586
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,320
Is John with you? He's, um...

587
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,360
Is John here?

588
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,960
He's downstairs.

589
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,240
So, what do you do now?

590
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,960
Kill us both?

591
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,033
Mary, whatever he's got on you,

592
00:34:11,034 --> 00:34:12,520
let me help.

593
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,880
Oh, Sherlock, if you take one more
step, I swear I will kill you.

594
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,360
No, Mrs Watson...

595
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,960
you won't.

596
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,400
I'm sorry, Sherlock.

597
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,160
I truly am.

598
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,960
Mary?

599
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,960
It's not like it is in the movies.

600
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,200
There's not a great big spurt of
blood and you go flying backwards.

601
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,920
The impact isn't spread
over a wide area.

602
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,760
It's tightly focused so there's
little or no energy transfer.

603
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,680
You stay still
and the bullet pushes through.

604
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,320
You're almost certainly going
to die, so we need to focus.

605
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,920
I said, "Focus!"

606
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,160
It's all well and clever
having a mind palace,

607
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,840
but you've only three seconds
of consciousness left to use it.

608
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,480
So, come on.
What's going to kill you?

609
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,320
Blood loss. Exactly.
So, it's all about one thing now -

610
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,600
forwards or backwards?

611
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,960
We need to decide which way
you're going to fall.

612
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,558
One hole or two? Sorry?

613
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:26,920
Is the bullet still inside you?

614
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,600
Or is there an exit wound?
It'll depend on the gun.

615
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,800
That one, I think.

616
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,360
Or that one.

617
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,280
Oh, for God's sake, Sherlock.
It doesn't matter about the gun.

618
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,040
Don't be stupid.

619
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,400
You always were so stupid.

620
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,560
Such a disappointment.

621
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,160
I'm not stupid.

622
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,640
You're a very stupid little boy.

623
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,840
Mummy and Daddy are very cross

624
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,280
because it doesn't matter
about the gun.

625
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,560
Why not?

626
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,760
You saw the whole room
when you entered it.

627
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,360
What was directly behind you
when you were murdered?

628
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,600
I've not been murdered YET.

629
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,800
Balance of probability,
little brother.

630
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,360
If the bullet had passed through
you, what would you have heard?

631
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,800
The mirror shattering.

632
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,320
You didn't. Therefore...?

633
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,960
The bullet's still inside me.

634
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,000
So we need to take him
down backwards.

635
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,960
I agree. Sherlock,
you need to fall on your back.

636
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,200
Right now the bullet is
the cork in a bottle.

637
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,760
The bullet itself is blocking
most of the blood flow.

638
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,120
But any pressure or impact on the
entrance wound could dislodge it.

639
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,640
Plus, on your back, gravity's
working for us.

640
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,960
Fall...

641
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,200
now.

642
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,960
What the hell is that?!
What's happening?!

643
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,200
You're going into shock. It's the
next thing that's going to kill you.

644
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,160
What do I do? Don't go
into shock, obviously.

645
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,320
Must be something in this ridiculous
memory palace of yours

646
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,760
that can calm you down.

647
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,520
Find it.

648
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,920
The East Wind is coming, Sherlock.

649
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,600
It's coming to get you.

650
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,240
Find it.

651
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,160
Hello, Redbeard. Here, boy.

652
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,760
Come on. Come to me.

653
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,560
It's OK. It's all right.

654
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,600
Come on.
It's me. It's me.

655
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,800
Come on.

656
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,720
Good boy. Clever boy.

657
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,200
Good boy.

658
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,080
Hello, Redbeard. They're putting
me down too now.

659
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,680
It's no fun, is it?

660
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,360
Redbeard.

661
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,400
That was shock. You're going
to feel the pain.

662
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,640
There's a hole ripped through you.

663
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,840
Massive internal bleeding.

664
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,120
You have to control the pain.

665
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,040
Control. Control. Control.

666
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,520
You...

667
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,480
You never felt pain, did you?

668
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,280
Why did you never feel pain?

669
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,000
You always feel it, Sherlock.

670
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,920
But you don't have to fear it!

671
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,560
Pain...

672
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,720
...heartbreak...

673
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,480
...loss...

674
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,960
...death...

675
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,520
...it's all good.

676
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,080
It's all good.

677
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,040
Sherlock! Sherlock. Can you hear me?

678
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,520
What happened?

679
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,760
He got shot.

680
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,880
Jesus!

681
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,200
Sherlock.

682
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,800
Oh, my!

683
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,000
Who shot him?!

684
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,240
'Emergency. Which service

We're losing you. Sherlock!

Come on, Sherlock.
Just die, why can't you?

694

One little push

695
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,000
and off you pop.

696
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,720
You're going to love being dead,
Sherlock. No-one ever bothers you.

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,640
Mrs Hudson will cry...

698
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,960
and Mummy and Daddy will cry...

699
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,200
and the woman will cry and John
will cry buckets and buckets.

700
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,280
It's him that I worry about
the most. That wife!

701
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,520
You're letting him down, Sherlock.

702
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,480
John Watson is definitely in danger.

703
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,360
Oh, you're not getting
better, are you?

704
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,000
Was it something I said, huh?

705
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,200
Sherlock!

706
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,520
Mary. Hey.

707
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,240
He's only bloody woken up.

708
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,600
He's pulled through. Really?
Yeah. Seriously? You...

709
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,360
Mrs Watson, you're in big trouble.

710
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,760
Really? Why?

711
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,720
His first word when he woke up...

712
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,960
"Mary."

713
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,680
You don't tell him.

714
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,200
Sherlock?

715
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,760
You don't tell John.

716
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,000
Bad girl.

717
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,760
Bad, bad girl.

718
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,200
Look at me...

719
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,720
...and tell me you're not
going to tell him.

720
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,040
I'm buying a cottage.

721
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,520
I've made a lot of money
out of you, mister.

722
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,880
Nothing hits the spot
like revenge with profits.

723
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,360
You didn't give those stories
to Magnussen, did you?

724
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,560
God, no. One of his rivals.
He was spitting.

725
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,160
Hmm.

726
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,640
Sherlock Holmes, you are
a back-stabbing, heartless,

727
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,400
manipulative bastard.

728
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,560
And you, as it turns out,
are a grasping, opportunistic,

729
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,040
publicity-hungry, tabloid whore.

730
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,520
So, we're good then?

731
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,560
Yeah, of course.

732
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,320
Where's the cottage? Sussex Downs.

733
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,240
Nice. It's gorgeous.

734
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,640
There's beehives,
but I'm getting rid of those.

735
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,960
Oh, it hurts, does it?

736
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,040
Probably want to restart
your morphine.

737
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,680
I might have fiddled with the taps.

738
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,200
How much more revenge are you going
to need? Just the occasional top-up.

739
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,360
Dream come true for you, this place.

740
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,560
They actually attach
the drugs to you.

741
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,200
Not good for working.

742
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,760
You won't be working
for a while, Sherl.

743
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,680
You lied to me.

744
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,000
You lied and lied.

745
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,800
I exploited the fact
of our connection.

746
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,080
When?

747
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,600
Just once would have been nice.

748
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,160
Oh.

749
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,520
I was waiting till we got married.

750
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,640
That was never going to happen.

751
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,400
Got to go.

752
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,560
I'm not supposed
to keep you talking.

753
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,200
And also, I have an interview
with The One Show

754
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,600
and I haven't made it up yet.

755
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,320
Just one thing...

756
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,840
you shouldn't have lied to me.

757
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,320
I know what kind of man you are,

758
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,040
but we could have been friends.

759
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,160
I'll give your love
to John and Mary.

760
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,520
You don't tell him.

761
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,880
You don't tell John.

762
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,240
So...

763
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,240
...Mary Watson...

764
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,720
...who are you?

765
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,840
Mary Watson.

766
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,640
I don't know how much sense
you'll get out of him.

767
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,840
He's drugged up,
so he's pretty much babbling.

768
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,040
Oh, they won't let you use
that in here, you know?

769
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,480
No, I'm not going to use the phone.
I just want to take a video.

770
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,800
Oh, Jesus!

771
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,880
So, where would he go?

772
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,560
Oh, Christ knows!

773
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,040
Try finding Sherlock in London.

774
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,360
He's got three known bolt-holes.

775
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,360
Parliament Hill, Camden Lock
and Dagmar Court.

776
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,000
Five known bolt holes.

777
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,280
There's the blind greenhouse
in Kew Gardens

778
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,360
and the leaning tomb
in Hampstead Cemetery.

779
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,840
Just the spare bedroom.

780
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,120
Well, my bedroom.

781
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,760
We agreed he needs the space.

782
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,520
Behind the clock face of Big Ben.

783
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,160
I think he was probably joking.

784
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,440
No, I don't think so.

785
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,640
Leinster Gardens. It's his number
one bolt hole. Top, top secret.

786
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,880
He only knows about it
cos he stalked him one night.

787
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,760
Followed! Followed, yeah.

788
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,720
He knew who shot him.

789
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,600
The bullet wound was here,
so he was facing whoever it was.

790
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,794
So, why not tell us?

791
00:46:22,795 --> 00:46:25,360
Because he's tracking them down himself.

792
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,680
Or protecting them.
Protecting the shooter, why?

793
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,160
Well, protecting someone then.
But why would he care?

794
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,920
He's Sherlock. Who would he
bother protecting?

795
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,200
Call me if you hear anything.
Don't hold out on me, John.

796
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,520
Call me, OK? Yeah. Yeah, right.

797
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,520
Good night then. Bye then.

798
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,720
John, need a cuppa?

799
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,680
Mrs Hudson, why does Sherlock think
that I'll be moving back in here?

800
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,520
Oh, yes, he's put your chair
back again, hasn't he?

801
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,080
That's nice. It looks much better.

802
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,800
John, what's wrong? Tell me. John?

803
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,120
That's your phone, isn't it?

804
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,560
It's Sherlock, John. Sherlock.

805
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,880
John, you have to answer it!

806
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,240
Spare any change, love? No.
Oh, come on, love.

807
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,920
Don't be like all the rest.

808
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,080
Rule one of looking
for Sherlock Holmes, he finds you.

809
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,400
You're working for Sherlock now?

810
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,080
Keeps me off the streets,
doesn't it? Well... no.

811
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,360
Where are you?
'Can't you see me?'

812
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,320
Well, what am I looking for?

813
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,080
'The lie, the lie of Leinster
Gardens, hidden in plain sight.

814
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,240
'Hardly anyone notices. People live
here for years and never see it.

815

'But if you are what I think you are,
it will take you less than a minute.

816
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,160
'The houses, Mary.
Look at the houses.'

817
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,240
How did you know I'd come here?

818
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,080
'I knew you'd talk to the people
no-one else would bother with.'

819
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,280
Huh, I thought I was being clever.

820
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,160
'You're always clever,
Mary, I was relying on that.

821
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,600
'I planted the information
for you to find.'

822
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,800
Ohh!

823
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,960
'30 seconds.'

824
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,640
But what am I looking at?

825
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,120
'No door knobs, no letterbox.
Painted windows.

826
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,280

not enough to kill me.

00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,847
That wasn't a miss,

871
00:51:08,848 --> 00:51:10,960
that was surgery.

872
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,240
I'll take the case. What case?

873
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,840
Yours. Why didn't you come to me
in the first place?

874
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,600
Because John can't ever know that
I lied to him.

875
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,240
It would break him
and I would lose him forever.

876
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,720
And Sherlock, I will never
let that happen.

877
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,280
Please, understand,

878
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:40,360
there is nothing in this world I
would not do to stop that happening.

879
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,560
Sorry.

880
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,800
Not that obvious a trick.

881
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,440
Now talk and sort it out
and do it quickly.

882
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:20,120
"Hark! The Herald
Angels Sing"

883
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:23,000
Oh, dear God, it's only two o'clock.

884
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,200
It's been Christmas Day
for at least a week now.

885
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,760
How can it only be two o'clock?
I'm in agony.

886
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,760
Mikey, is this your laptop?

887
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,640
Upon which depends the security
of the free world, yes,

888
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,400
and you've got potatoes on it!

889
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,920
You shouldn't leave it lying around
if it's so important.

890
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,200
Why are we doing this?
We never do this.

891
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,920
We are here because Sherlock
is home from hospital

892
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,080
and we are all very happy.

893
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,720
Am I happy too? I haven't checked.

894
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,960
Behave, Mike!

895
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,640
Mycroft is the name you gave me,

896
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,560
if you could possibly struggle all
the way to the end. Mrs Holmes.

897
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:57,960
Oh, thank you, dear. I'm not
absolutely sure why you're here.

898
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,360
I invited him.

899
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,080
I'm his protege, Mrs Holmes.

900
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,160
When he dies,
I get all his stuff and his job.

901
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,680
No. Oh, well, I help out a bit.

902
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,760
Closer.

903
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,600
If he does get murdered or
something...

904
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,680
Probably stop talking now. OK.

905
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,800
Lovely when you
bring your friends round(!)

906
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,960
Stop it, you.
Somebody's put a bullet in my boy.

907
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:22,600
If I ever find out who,
I shall turn absolutely monstrous.

908
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,880
This was for Mary.
I'll be back in a minute.

909
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,920
Ah. Mary. There you are.

910
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,280
Cup of tea. If Father starts
making little humming noises,

911
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,360
just give him a little poke.
That usually does it.

912
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,440
Did you write this?

913
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,560
Oh, that silly old thing,
you mustn't read that.

914
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,720
Mathematics must seem terribly
fatuous now.

915
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,800
No humming, you.

916
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,440
Complete flake, my wife, but happens
to be a genius.

917
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,000
She was a mathematician?

918
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,986
Gave it all up for children. I could

919
00:53:58,987 --> 00:54:01,640
never bear to argue with her.

920
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,360
I'm something of a moron myself.

921
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:08,120
But she's... unbelievably hot.

922
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:12,120
Oh my God, you're the sane one,
aren't you?

923
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,400
Aren't you?

924
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,040
Oh. Sorry, I just, er...

925
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,400
Oh, you two need a moment?

926
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,280
If you don't mind?

927
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,240
No, course not. I'll go and see if
I can help with...

928
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,720
something or another.

929
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,160
Those two. They all right?

930
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,520
Well, you know,
they've had their ups and downs.

931
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,480
Baker Street, now.

932
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,200
John, Mary...

933
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,120
Oh, Sherlock, oh, good gracious,
you look terrible!

934
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,520
Get me some morphine
from your kitchen, I've run out.

935
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:20,160
I don't have any morphine. Then what
exactly is the point of you?!

936
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,680
What is going on?

937
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,000
Bloody good question.

938
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,061
The Watsons are about to have a domestic and fairly

939
00:55:25,062 --> 00:55:27,000
quickly I hope, because we've got work to do.

940
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,360
No, I have a better question -

941
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:32,440
is everyone I have ever met
a psychopath?

942
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,960
Yes.

943
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,720
Good that we've settled that.
Now we... SHUT UP!

944
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,680
And stay shut up,
because this is not funny.

945
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,720
Not this time.

946
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,560
I didn't say it was funny. You.

947
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,280
What have I ever done? Hmm?

948
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,080
My whole life, to deserve you?

949
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,640
Everything.

950
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,320
Sherlock, I've told you, shut up.

951
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,360
No, I mean it -
seriously, everything.

952
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,680
Everything you've ever done,
is what you did.

953
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,080
Sherlock, one more word
and you will not need morphine.

954
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,080
You were a doctor who went to war.

955
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,960
You're a man who couldn't stay in
the suburbs for more than a month

956
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,360
without storming a crack den,
beating up a junkie.

957
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,880
Your best friend is a
sociopath, who solves crimes

958
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,755
as an alternative to getting high.

959
00:56:15,756 --> 00:56:17,520
That's me, by the way, hello.

960
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,440
Even the landlady used to
run a drug cartel.

961
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,440
It was my husband's cartel.
I was just typing.

962
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,080
And exotic dancing.

963
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,480
Sherlock Holmes,
if you've been YouTubing...

964
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,240
John, you are addicted to
a certain lifestyle.

965
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,269
You are abnormally attracted to

966
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:34,560
dangerous situations and people,

967
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:39,440
so is it truly such a surprise
that the woman you fall in love with

968
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,080
conforms to that pattern?

969
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,480
But she wasn't supposed to
be like that!

970
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,080
Why is SHE like that?

971
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,600
Because you chose her.

972
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,880
Why is everything always

973
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,960
Oh, neighbours!

974
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,560
John, listen. Be calm and answer me.

975
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,520
What is she?

976
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,760
My lying wife? No, what is she?

977
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,280
And the woman who is carrying my child, who
has lied to me since the day I met her.

978
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,640
No. Not in this flat,
not in this room.

979
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:23,360
Right here, right now, what is she?

980
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,400
OK.

981
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,720
Your way.

982
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,920
Always your way.

983
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,120
Sit.

984
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,480
Why?

985
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,560
Because that's where they sit.

986
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,640
The people who come in here
with their stories.

987
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,000
They're the clients,
that's all you are now, Mary.

988
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,040
You're a client.

989
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,640
This is where you sit and talk
and this is where we sit and listen.

990
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,600
Then we decide
if we want you or not.

991
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,440
So, are you OK?

992
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:39,440
Oh, are we doing conversation today?
It really is Christmas(!)

993
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,600
Now?

994
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:50,000
Seriously, months of silence
and we're going to do this now?

995
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,280
A.G.R.A., what's that?

996
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,440
Er... my initials.

997
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,560
Everything about who
I was is on there.

998
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,920
If you love me,
don't read it in front of me.

999
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,840
Why?

1000
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:18,040
Because you won't love me
when you've finished

1001
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,840
and I don't want to see that happen.

1002
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,920
How much do you know already?

1003
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,240
By your skill set, you are, or were,
an intelligence agent.

1004
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,280
Your accent is currently English,
but I suspect you are not.

1005
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,840
You're on the run from something.

1006
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,080
You've used your skills
to disappear.

1007
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,000
Magnussen knows your secret, which
is why you were going to kill him.

1008
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,880
And I assume you befriended
Janine in order to get close to him.

1009
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,160
Oh, you can talk!

1010
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,480
Oh, look at you two,
you should have got married.

1011
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,840
The stuff Magnussen has on me,

1012
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,640
I would go to prison for the rest of
my life.

1013
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,223
So you were going to kill him? People

1014
00:59:57,224 --> 00:59:58,720
like Magnussen should be killed,

1015
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,160
that's why there are people like me.
Perfect!

1016
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:04,240
So that's what you were, an assassin?
How could I not see that?

1017
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,480
You did see that.

1018
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,680
And you married me.

1019
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,160
Because he's right.

1020
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,840
It's what you like.

1021
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,080
So, Mary, any documents that
Magnussen has

1022
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:30,360
concerning yourself,
you want extracted and returned.

1023
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,400
Why would you help me?

1024
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,680
Because you saved my life.

1025
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,000
Sorry-sorry, what?

1026
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,280
When I happened on you
and Magnussen...

1027
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,520
...you had a problem.

1028
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,000
More specifically,
you had a witness.

1029
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,720
What do you do now?

1030
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,840
Kill both of us?

1031
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:01,600
'The solution, of course, was
simple. Kill us both and leave.'

1032
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,800
However,
sentiment got the better of you.

1033
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,720
'One precisely calculated shot
to incapacitate me,

1034
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:25,840
'in the hope that it would buy you
more time to negotiate my silence.'

1035
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,520
Of course,
you couldn't shoot Magnussen.

1036
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,640
On the night both of us
broke into the building,

1037
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,320
your own husband would
become a suspect. So...

1038
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:43,040
'You calculated that Magnussen would
use the fact of your involvement...'

1039
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:47,560
rather than sharing the information
with the police, as is his MO.

1040
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:54,680
And then you left the way you came.

1041
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,160
Have I missed anything?

1042
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,760
How did she save your life?

1043
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,040
She phoned the ambulance.
I phoned the ambulance.

1044
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,560
She phoned first.

1045
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,920
'Emergency,
which service do you require?'

1046
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,000
You didn't find me
for another five minutes.

1047
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,440
Left to you, I would have died.

1048
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,600
The average arrival
time for a London ambulance is...

1049
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,720
Did somebody call an ambulance?

1050
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:18,720
Eight minutes. Did you bring any
morphine? I asked on the phone.

1051
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,360
We were told there was a shooting.

1052
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,080
There was, last week.

1053
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,800
But I believe I'm bleeding
internally,

1054
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,960
my pulse is very erratic, you may need
to restart my heart on the way...

1055
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,600
Jesus, Sherlock. Come on, Sherlock.
Argh!

1056
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:34,200
John, John,
Magnussen is all that matters now.

1057
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,680
You can trust Mary -
she saved my life.

1058
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,280
She shot you.

1059
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,840
Mixed messages, I grant you that...
Argh!

1060
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,000
Sherlock! Sherlock! Take him.

1061
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,240
Got him? Yeah.

1062
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,400
So, have you read it?

1063
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,280
Would you come here a moment?
No, tell me, have you?

1064
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,360
Just... Come here.

1065
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,360
No, I'm fine.

1066
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,840
I've thought long and hard
about what I want to say to you.

1067
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,280
These are prepared words, Mary.

1068
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,920
I've chosen these words with care.
OK.

1069
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:37,440
The problems of your past
are your business.

1070
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,840
The problems of your future...

1071
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,960
are my privilege.

1072
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,480
It's all I have to say,
it's all I need to know.

1073
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,960
No, I didn't read it.

1074
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,240
You don't even know my name.

1075
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,720
Is "Mary Watson" good enough for you?

1076
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,520
Yes. Oh my God, yes.

1077
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,360
Then it's good enough for me, too.

1078
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,600
All this does not mean that I'm not
still basically pissed off with you.

1079
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,000
Hmm, I know, I know.

1080
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I am very pissed off,
and it will come out now and then.

1081
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,240
I know, I know, I know.

1082
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,640
You can mow the sodding
lawn from now on.

1083
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,440
I do mow the lawn. I do it loads.

1084
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,680
You really don't.

1085
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,080
I choose the baby's name.
Not a chance. OK.

1086
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,120
I'm glad you've given up on the
Magnussen business. Are you?

1087
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,786
I'm still curious, though. He's

1088
01:04:41,787 --> 01:04:43,720
hardly your usual kind of puzzle.

1089
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,200
Why do you hate him?

1090
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,240
Because he attacks people
who are different

1091
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,840
and preys on their secrets.
Why don't you?

1092
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,520
He never causes too much damage
to anyone important.

1093
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,440
He's far too intelligent for that.

1094
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,571
He's a businessman, that's all.

1095
01:04:56,572 --> 01:04:58,840
And occasionally useful to us.

1096
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,920
A necessary evil,
not a dragon for you to slay.

1097
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,480
A dragon-slayer.
Is that what you think of me?

1098
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,680
No. It's what you think of yourself.

1099
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,080
Are you two smoking?!

1100
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,440
No. It was Mycroft.

1101
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:22,200
I have, by the way, a job offer
I should like you to decline.

1102
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,240
I decline your kind offer.

1103
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,640
I shall pass on your regrets.

1104
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,793
What was it? MI6.

1105
01:05:26,794 --> 01:05:30,320
They want to place you back into Eastern Europe.

1106
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:33,720
An undercover assignment
that would prove fatal to you in,

1107
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:36,520
I think, about six months.

1108
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,040
Then why don't you want me
to take it?

1109
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:43,200
It's tempting, but on balance, you
have more utility closer to home.

1110
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,480
Utility! How do I have utility?

1111
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,720
Here be dragons.

1112
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,600
This isn't agreeing with me.

1113
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,920
I'm going in.

1114
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,480
You need low tar.
You still smoke like a beginner.

1115
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,720
Also...

1116
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,280
...your loss would break my heart.

1117
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,320
What the hell am
I supposed to say to that?!

1118
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,360
Merry Christmas? You hate Christmas.

1119
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:18,120
Yes. Perhaps there was
something in the punch.

1120
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,120
Clearly. Go and have some more.

1121
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:27,320
So you realise that Sherlock got us out
here to see his mum and dad for a reason?

1122
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:31,640
His lovely mum and dad, a fine
example of married life, I get that.

1123
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:35,200
That is the thing with Sherlock,
it's always the unexpected.

1124
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,520
Oi. Oi? Mary?

1125
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:41,600
Jesus Christ! Mary? Sit down.

1126
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,840
Mary, can you hear me?

1127
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,360
Don't drink Mary's tea.

1128
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,120
Or the punch.

1129
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,720
Sherlock...

1130
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,840
Did you just drug my pregnant wife?!

1131
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,200
Don't worry,
Wiggins is an excellent chemist.

1132
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:05,560
I calculated your wife's dose
myself. Won't affect the little one.

1133
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,680
I'll keep an eye on her.

1134
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:09,720
He'll monitor their recovery.
It's more or less his day job.

1135
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,000
What the hell have you done?!

1136
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,040
A deal with the devil.

1137
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,200
Shouldn't you be in hospital?

1138
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,800
I am in hospital.
This is the canteen.

1139
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,120
Is it? In my opinion, yes.
Have a seat.

1140
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,160
Thank you.

1141
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,360
I've been thinking about you.

1142
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,520
I've been thinking about you.

1143
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,960
Really?

1144
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,760
I want to see Appledore.

1145
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,160
Where you keep all the secrets,
all the files,

1146
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,440
everything you've got on everyone.

1147
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,160
I want you to invite me.

1148
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,800
What makes you think
I'd be so careless?

1149
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:04,800
Oh, I think you're a lot more
careless than you let on.

1150
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,520
Am I?

1151
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,880
It's the dead-eyed stare
that gives it away.

1152
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,720
Except it's not dead-eyed, is it?

1153
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,360
You're reading.

1154
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:34,960
Portable Appledore.
How does it work?

1155
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:40,920
Built-in flash drive? 4G wireless?

1156
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:58,160
They're just ordinary spectacles.

1157
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:00,920
Yes, they are.

1158
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,040
You underestimate me, Mr Holmes.

1159
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,920
Impress me, then. Show me Appledore.

1160
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,520
Everything is available for a price.

1161
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,280
Are you making me an offer?

1162
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,520
A Christmas present.

1163
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:38,520
And what are you giving me
for Christmas, Mr Holmes?

1164
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,880
My brother.

1165
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,440
Oh, Jesus!

1166
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:54,000
Sherlock, please tell me you haven't
just gone out of your mind.

1167
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,440
I'd rather keep you guessing.

1168
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,720
Ah, there's our lift.

1169
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:06,840
Coming?

1170
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,320
Where?

1171
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,240
You want your wife to be safe?
Of course I do.

1172
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,640
Good, because this is going to be
incredibly dangerous.

1173
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,400
One false move and we'll have betrayed the
security of the United Kingdom and be in prison

1174
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,720
for high treason. Magnussen is the most
dangerous man we've ever encountered

1175
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,400
and the odds are
comprehensively stacked against us.

1176
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,800
But it's Christmas! I feel the same.

1177
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,317
Oh, you mean it's actually Christmas.

1178
01:10:26,318 --> 01:10:28,040
Did you bring your gun, as I suggested?

1179
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,939
Why would I bring my gun to your parents' house

1180
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:31,960
for Christmas dinner?! Is it in your coat? Yes.

1181
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,811
Off we go, then. Where are we going?

1182
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:34,480
Appledore.

1183
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:34,520
I would offer you a drink,
but it's very rare and expensive.

1184
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,800
Oh, it WAS you.

1185
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,560
Yes, of course.

1186
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,160
Very hard to find a pressure
point on you, Mr Holmes.

1187
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:51,080
The drugs thing
I never believed for a moment.

1188
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:55,360
Anyway, you wouldn't care
if it was exposed, would you?

1189
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:58,480
But look how you
care about John Watson.

1190
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,920
Your damsel in distress.

1191
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:08,240
You put me in a fire, for leverage?!

1192
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,000
Oh, I would never let you burn,
Dr Watson.

1193
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,362
I had people standing by.

1194
01:12:13,363 --> 01:12:15,440
I'm not a murderer.

1195
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,920
Unlike your wife.

1196
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,720
Let me explain how leverage works,
Dr Watson.

1197
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,520
For those who understand
these things,

1198
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:36,480
Mycroft Holmes is the most powerful
man in the country.

1199
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,680
Well, apart from me.

1200
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:44,800
Mycroft's pressure point is his
junkie detective brother, Sherlock.

1201
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,760
Sherlock's pressure point
is his best friend, John Watson.

1202
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,640
John Watson's pressure
point is his wife.

1203
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,880
I own John Watson's wife,
I own Mycroft.

1204
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,760
He's what I'm getting for Christmas.

1205
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,880
It's an exchange, not a gift.

1206
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,280
Forgive me, but...

1207
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,640
I already seem to have it.

1208
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,160
It's password protected.

1209
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,560
In return for the password,
you will give me any material

1210
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,680
in your possession pertaining to the
woman I know as Mary Watson.

1211
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,254
Oh, she's bad, that one.

1212
01:13:24,255 --> 01:13:26,720
So many dead people.

1213
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,360
You should see what I've seen.
I don't need to see it.

1214
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,836
You might enjoy it, though.

1215
01:13:31,837 --> 01:13:33,120
I enjoy it.

1216
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,240
Then why don't you show us?

1217
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,437
Show you Appledore?

1218
01:13:38,438 --> 01:13:39,760
The secret vaults.

1219
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,400
Is that what you want?

1220
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,720
I want everything you've
got on Mary.

1221
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:59,120
You know, I honestly expected
something good.

1222
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,411
Oh, I think you'll find the contents of

1223
01:14:01,412 --> 01:14:03,760
that laptop... Include a GPS locator.

1224
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,680
By now your brother will
have noticed the theft

1225
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:10,560
and the security services will be
converging on this house.

1226
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,480
Having arrived, they'll find
top-secret information in my hands

1227
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:18,120
and they have every justification
to search my vaults.

1228
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,720
They will discover further
information of this kind

1229
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,640
and I will be imprisoned.

1230
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,985
You would be exonerated and restored

1231
01:14:24,986 --> 01:14:27,200
to your smelly little apartment

1232
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,960
to solve crimes with
Mr and Mrs Psychopath.

1233
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:35,520
Mycroft has been looking for this
opportunity for a long time.

1234
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,360
He'll be a very, very proud
big brother.

1235
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,800
The fact that you know it's going to
happen isn't going to stop it.

1236
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,000
Then why am I smiling?

1237
01:14:48,001 --> 01:14:49,600
Ask me.

1238
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,480
Why are you smiling?

1239
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,480
Because Sherlock Holmes has made
one enormous mistake,

1240
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,880
which will destroy
the lives of everyone he loves.

1241
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,560
And everything he holds dear.

1242
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,723
Let me show you

1243
01:15:09,724 --> 01:15:12,160
the Appledore vaults.

1244
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,240
The entrance to my vaults.

1245
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,120
This is where I keep you all.

1246
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,040
OK, so where are the vaults, then?

1247
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:50,120
Vaults? What vaults? There are no
vaults beneath this building.

1248
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,560
They're all in here.

1249
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,000
The Appledore vaults
are my mind palace.

1250
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,560
You know about mind palaces,
don't you, Sherlock?

1251
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:08,640
How to store information so you
never forget it, by picturing it.

1252
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:15,360
I just sit here, I close my eyes
and down I go to my vaults.

1253
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:22,040
I can go anywhere inside my vaults.

1254
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,000
My memories.

1255
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:34,280
I'll look at the files
on Mrs Watson.

1256
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:43,840
Hmm.

1257
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:48,280
Oh, this is one of my favourites.

1258
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,480
Oh, it's so exciting.

1259
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,560
All those wet jobs for the CIA.

1260
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:02,160
Ooh, she's gone a bit freelance now,
bad girl.

1261
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:13,400
Oh, she's so wicked.

1262
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,800
I can really see why you like her.

1263
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,880
You see?

1264
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:27,080
So there are no documents, you don't
actually have anything here?

1265
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,880
Oh, sometimes
I send out for something,

1266
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:32,600
if I really need it,
but mostly I just remember it all.

1267
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:33,720
I don't understand.

1268
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:36,560
You should have that on a T-shirt.
You just remember it all?

1269
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:41,360
It's all about knowledge,
everything is. Knowing is owning.

1270
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,520
But if you just know it,
then you don't have proof.

1271
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,240
Proof? What would I need proof for?

1272
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,360
I'm in news, you moron.

1273
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:51,440
I don't have to prove it,
I just have to print it.

1274
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,360
Speaking of news...

1275
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:56,240
You'll both be heavily
featured tomorrow.

1276
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,600
Trying to sell state secrets to me.

1277
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,640
Tut tut.

1278
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:05,800
Let's go outside.
They'll be here shortly.

1279
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,600
Can't wait to see you arrested.

1280
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,680
Sherlock, do we have a plan?

1281
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,280
Sherlock?

1282
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:29,720
They're taking their time,
aren't they?

1283
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,160
I still don't understand.

1284
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,320
And there's the back of the T-shirt.

1285
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:36,640
You just know things -
how does that work?

1286
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:40,240
I just love your little soldier
face. I'd like to punch it.

1287
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,600
Bring it over here a minute.

1288
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:46,320
Come on. For Mary.
Bring me your face.

1289
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,680
Lean forward a bit
and stick your face out.

1290
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:00,720
Please.

1291
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:03,800
Now, can I flick it?

1292
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:08,720
Look at me. Can I flick your face?

1293
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:21,040
I just love doing this.
I could do it all day.

1294
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,320
Well, it works like this, John.

1295
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,480
I know who Mary hurt and killed.

1296
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,480
I know where to find
people who hate her.

1297
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,960
I know where they live,
I know their phone numbers.

1298
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,120
All in my mind palace, all of it.

1299
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:46,520
I could phone them right now
and tear your whole life down...

1300
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,720
...and I will,

1301
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:53,120
unless you let me flick your face.

1302
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,200
This is what I do to people.

1303
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,280
This is what I do to
whole countries.

1304
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:09,040
Just because I know.

1305
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,160
Can I do your eye now?

1306
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,240
See if you can keep it open, hmm?

1307
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,400
Come on, for Mary. Keep it open.

1308
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,720
Sherlock?

1309
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:22,720
Let him. I'm sorry, just... let him.

1310
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,080
Hmm? Come on, eye open.

1311
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,280
It's difficult, isn't it?

1312
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,136
Janine managed to once.

1313
01:20:35,137 --> 01:20:37,800
She makes the funniest noises.

1314
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:50,840
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,
stand away from that man.

1315
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:53,000
Here we go, Mr Holmes.

1316
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,240
To clarify, Appledore's vaults only
exist in your mind,

1317
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:59,400
nowhere else, just there?

1318
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,640
They're not real,
they never have been.

1319
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:06,040
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,
step away!

1320
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,960
It's fine, they're harmless.

1321
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,640
'Target is not armed,
I repeat target is not armed.'

1322
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:12,920
Sherlock, what do we do?

1323
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:16,000
Nothing. There is
nothing to be done.

1324
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,840
Oh, I'm not a villain,
I have no evil plan.

1325
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:24,560
I'm a businessman, acquiring assets.
You happen to be one of them.

1326
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,480
Sorry, no chance for you to be
a hero this time, Mr Holmes.

1327
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:34,040
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,
stand away from that man. Do it now!

1328
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:36,160
Oh, do your research.

1329
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:41,320
I'm not a hero,
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.

1330
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,280
Merry Christmas!

1331
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,440
'Man down, man down.'

1332
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,560
Get away from me,
John! Stay well back!

1333
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,560
Christ, Sherlock!

1334
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,720
Don't fire! Do not
fire on Sherlock Holmes!

1335
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:55,720
Do not fire!

1336
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,600
Oh Christ, Sherlock!

1337
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,668
Give my love to Mary.

1338
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:07,840
Tell her she's safe now.

1339
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,280
Oh, Sherlock.

1340
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,000
What have you done?

1341
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:54,160
As my colleague is
fond of remarking,

1342
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:57,400
this country sometimes needs
a blunt instrument.

1343
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,160
Equally,
it sometimes needs a dagger,

1344
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:02,697
a scalpel wielded with precision

1345
01:23:02,698 --> 01:23:04,520
and without remorse.

1346
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:08,829
There will always come a time

1347
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:11,200
when we need Sherlock Holmes.

1348
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,221
If this is some expression

1349
01:23:13,222 --> 01:23:15,320
of familial sentiment...

1350
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,520
Don't be absurd.

1351
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:19,560
I am not given to
outbursts of brotherly compassion.

1352
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:24,440
You know what
happened to the other one.

1353
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:28,160
In any event, there is no prison in
which we could incarcerate Sherlock

1354
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:31,520
without causing a riot
on a daily basis.

1355
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,074
The alternative, however,

1356
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:37,240
would require your approval.

1357
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,160
Hardly merciful, Mr Holmes.

1358
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:41,720
Regrettably, Lady Smallwood,

1359
01:23:41,721 --> 01:23:44,280
my brother is a murderer.

1360
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,760
You will look after him for me,
won't you?

1361
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,880
Hmm. Don't worry.
I'll keep him in trouble.

1362
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,000
That's my girl.

1363
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:13,320
Since this is likely to be the last
conversation I'll have with John Watson,

1364
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,240
would you mind if we took a moment?

1365
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:25,960
So here we are.

1366
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,000
William Sherlock Scott Holmes.

1367
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,120
Sorry?

1368
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,640
That's the whole of it.
If you're looking for baby names.

1369
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,800
No, we've had a scan,
we're pretty sure it's a girl.

1370
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,200
Oh. OK.

1371
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,400
Yeah.

1372
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,000
You know, actually, I can't
think of a single thing to say.

1373
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,360
No, neither can I.

1374
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,400
The game is over.

1375
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:56,280
The game is never over, John.

1376
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,320
But there may be some
new players now.

1377
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:01,046
That's OK, the East Wind takes us all in the end.

1378
01:25:01,047 --> 01:25:01,880
What's that?

1379
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:06,120
It's a story my brother told me
when we were kids.

1380
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:10,640
The East Wind is a terrifying force
that lays waste to all in its path.

1381
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:14,080
It seeks out the unworthy
and plucks them from the earth.

1382
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,280
That was generally me.

1383
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,720
Nice(!)
He's a rubbish big brother.

1384
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:24,200
So what about you, then?
Where are you actually going now?

1385
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,800
Oh, some undercover
work in Eastern Europe.

1386
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,200
For how long?

1387
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:33,400
Six months, my brother estimates.
He's never wrong.

1388
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:34,480
And then what?

1389
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,080
Who knows?

1390
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:51,160
John, there's something I should
say, I've meant to say always

1391
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,600
and I never have.

1392
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:56,520
Since it's unlikely we'll ever meet
again, I might as well say it now.

1393
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,480
Sherlock is actually a girl's name.

1394
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:07,080
It's not.

1395
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,280
It was worth a try.

1396
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,520
We're not naming our daughter
after you.

1397
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:12,040
Oh, I think it could work.

1398
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,520
To the very best of times, John.

1399
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:10,200
'Smith brings it inside.
This looks good.

1400
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:13,160
'Cassandra comes in for a shot.
Ooh, he missed it!'

1401
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:18,760
Oi, there's something wrong with the telly.
There's something wrong with the telly, mate.

1402
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,280
Who's that?

1403
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:23,840
Did you miss me?

1404
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:27,080
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?

1405
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,760
How is this possible?

1406
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:31,600
We don't know, but it's on every
screen in the country.

1407
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,080
Every screen simultaneously.

1408
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,000
Has the Prime Minister been told?

1409
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,360
And Mycroft?

1410
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:41,440
But that's not possible. That is
simply not possible.

1411
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:45,594
What's happened?

1412
01:27:45,595 --> 01:27:47,600
Sir? It's your brother.

1413
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,680
Mycroft?

1414
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:54,120
'Hello, little brother.
How's the exile going?'

1415
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,600
I've only been gone four minutes.

1416
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,800
Well, I certainly hope you've
learnt your lesson.

1417
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:00,640
'As it turns out, you're needed.'

1418
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,760
Oh, for God's sake,
make up your mind!

1419
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,120
Who needs me this time?

1420
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,720
'Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?

1421
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:12,320
'Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?'

1422
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,880
England.

1423
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:16,480
But he's dead. I mean, you told me
he was dead, Moriarty?

1424
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,360
Absolutely. Blew his own brains out.

1425
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,360
So how can he be back?

1426
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:24,640
Well if he is,
he'd better wrap up warm.

1427
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,120
There's an East Wind coming.

1428
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,480
Miss me?
