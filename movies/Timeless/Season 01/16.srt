chance to help you get your sister?

716
00:37:44,995 --> 00:37:48,595
I'm really sorry that you won't
be able to get Jessica back.

717
00:37:55,976 --> 00:38:00,049
Maybe we do need to stop
trying to fix the past...

718
00:38:01,005 --> 00:38:03,690
and start looking at the present.

719
00:38:06,152 --> 00:38:09,219
Maybe I do need to be
open to the possibilities.

720
00:38:10,836 --> 00:38:12,836
The possibilities of what?

721
00:38:15,184 --> 00:38:17,184
I don't know.

722
00:38:19,188 --> 00:38:22,282
I just know I'm not really
ready to say good - Bye yet.

723
00:38:25,891 --> 00:38:28,529
Ah, the Lifeboat will be
charged and ready to go

724
00:38:28,531 --> 00:38:31,063

726

Will you tell Rufus
I'll be back in an hour?

727
00:38:39,211 --> 00:38:42,391
There's just one thing
I have to do first.

728
00:38:56,466 --> 00:38:58,195
Hey, Mom.

729
00:38:58,197 --> 00:38:59,696
Oh, Lucy!

730
00:39:00,028 --> 00:39:01,865
Oh, thank God.

731
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,325
- It's been days. Where have you been?
- I know.

732
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,677
- I have to tell you something.
- You can tell me anything.

733
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:11,499
Come here.

734

00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:16,100
- Here you go.
- All right.

736
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:18,100
You're gonna think I'm insane,

737
00:39:18,116 --> 00:39:19,421
but you deserve the truth.

738
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,890
- I'm listening.
- [chuckles]

739
00:39:22,064 --> 00:39:25,032
Connor Mason invented a time machine...

740
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,695
and it's real.

741
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,497
Time travel is real,

742
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,688
and when I went on my first mission,

743
00:39:30,713 --> 00:39:32,446
i went to the Hindenburg in 1937,

744
00:39:32,447 --> 00:39:34,714
and when I left, I had a sister,

745
00:39:34,716 --> 00:39:37,157
and when I came back...

746
00:39:38,453 --> 00:39:39,953
she was gone.

747
00:39:39,955 --> 00:39:41,588
Lucy, a sister?

748
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:44,624
Yes. I have a sister.
You have another daughter,

749
00:39:44,626 --> 00:39:46,559
and her name is Amy, and she is smart,

750
00:39:46,561 --> 00:39:49,237
and she is funny, and she
has a degree in sociology,

751
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,096
and a black belt in karate,
which is super weird,

752
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:52,964
and she has no idea what she
wants to do with her life,

753
00:39:52,966 --> 00:39:54,432
but oh, my God, does
she know how to live it,

754
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,735
and she is my best friend.

755
00:39:56,737 --> 00:39:59,370
Lucy, this person doesn't exist.

756
00:39:59,372 --> 00:40:01,940
Yes, this person does exist.

757
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:04,275
If you could remember the way
that we were as a family...

758
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:06,912
if you woke up one day
and I was suddenly gone,

759
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,269
you would have to do the same thing.

760
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,928
- Do what?
- I have to get her back.

761
00:40:10,953 --> 00:40:12,405
I have to get her back.

762
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,153
And the problem is that...

763
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,644
in the timeline that Amy existed,

764
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,257
you were sick... you were very...

765
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:18,581
you were very sick.

766
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,280
And I am gonna do everything
that I can to save you,

767
00:40:21,305 --> 00:40:23,752
but time travel is super unpredictable,

768
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:24,987
and I don't know if
I'm gonna be able to,

769
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,616
so I just want to tell you that I...

770
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,793
I love you.

771
00:40:33,613 --> 00:40:35,613
Oh, sweetheart.

772
00:40:37,422 --> 00:40:40,524
Lucy, you won't lose me.
