It's why we remember the Alamo.

Because Travis was killed

Are we gonna fight every day now?

905
00:40:01,472 --> 00:40:03,070
No.

906
00:40:03,073 --> 00:40:04,906
<b>(POIGNANT MUSIC)</b>

907
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:06,340
I don't want to fight anymore.

908
00:40:06,343 --> 00:40:09,544
Oh, Lucy.

909
00:40:09,547 --> 00:40:11,679
Life's too short.

911
00:40:17,888 --> 00:40:19,820
I was a junior.

912
00:40:19,823 --> 00:40:22,823
And he was...

913
00:40:22,826 --> 00:40:24,258
well, he was a professor,

914
00:40:24,261 --> 00:40:26,227
if you really want to know the truth.

915
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:29,564
He loved to argue.

916
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:32,900
And he was handsome.

917
00:40:32,903 --> 00:40:35,069
He wanted to go into politics.

919
00:40:37,908 --> 00:40:40,074
And then I told him I was pregnant.

920
00:40:40,077 --> 00:40:41,742
What did he say?

921
00:40:41,745 --> 00:40:43,711
You know, all the things
that he was supposed to.

922
00:40:43,714 --> 00:40:45,513
Back then that's what you did.

923
00:40:45,516 --> 00:40:47,915
But I didn't want to marry him.

924
00:40:47,918 --> 00:40:50,718
Hell, I barely even knew him.

925
00:40:50,721 --> 00:40:54,388
So we fought and I told
him I didn't need his help,

926
00:40:54,391 --> 00:40:55,923
and... <b>(SIGHS)</b>

927
00:40:55,926 --> 00:40:59,527
I haven't heard from him since.

928
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,730
And, Lucy, I have no regrets.

929
00:41:02,733 --> 00:41:04,599
None.

931
00:41:08,606 --> 00:41:11,272
And this is his name.

934
00:41:26,757 --> 00:41:30,658
Wyatt Logan.
What are you doing here?

935
00:41:30,661 --> 00:41:32,059
Heard you were stealing our oxygen.

<b>(CHUCKLES)</b>

937
00:41:33,397 --> 00:41:35,229
Well, they dragged me up
from Pendleton,

938
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,398
won't tell me crap,
and now they're flying me back.

939
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:39,000
I don't suppose
you know what's going on.

940
00:41:39,003 --> 00:41:40,501
What do you think?

941
00:41:40,504 --> 00:41:42,670
I figured the fact that you're here

942
00:41:42,673 --> 00:41:44,472
mean this whole thing
is seriously fubar.

943
00:41:44,475 --> 00:41:47,241
- <b>(CHUCKLES)</b>
- It's good seeing you.

944
00:41:47,244 --> 00:41:49,577
You too.

945
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,812
Hey, when are you
coming back to base?

946
00:41:51,815 --> 00:41:53,581
We're prepping for an op right now.

947
00:41:53,584 --> 00:41:55,016
It's the real deal.

948
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:57,184
Robbie's there, Matty, all the boys.

949
00:41:57,187 --> 00:41:59,754
You'd love it.

950
00:41:59,757 --> 00:42:03,290
Yeah, I think I'll be here
for a while.

951
00:42:03,293 --> 00:42:05,294
I got a new team.
