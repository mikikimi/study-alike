Wilkes Booth's going to be,

194

205

206

What, Is he scouting for tonight?

207
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:43,936
No, he's an actor.

208
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,038
He knew Ford's Theatre like
the back of his hand,

209
00:09:46,072 --> 00:09:47,539
used it as his mailing address,

- An actor.
- Pretty well known too.

212
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:52,421
But his brother, Edwin, was literally

213
00:09:52,445 --> 00:09:54,713
the most famous actor in America.

214
00:09:54,748 --> 00:09:56,248
John never quite measured up.

215
00:09:56,283 --> 00:09:57,660

00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,718

217
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:02,087

907
00:41:07,025 --> 00:41:09,560
The way you ran out
yesterday, and now this.

908
00:41:09,594 --> 00:41:11,996
And I'm not supposed to worry.

909
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,397
I'm sorry.

910
00:41:13,432 --> 00:41:17,468
It's just been a little... hectic.

911
00:41:17,502 --> 00:41:18,969
I see.

912
00:41:19,004 --> 00:41:21,038
So did you help out your friend Amy?

913
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:24,408
I'm still working on it.

914
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:26,977
Well, please go freshen up

915
00:41:27,012 --> 00:41:29,213
and find your engagement ring.

916
00:41:29,247 --> 00:41:31,415
Mom.

918
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:36,687
I need to talk to you
about something.

919
00:41:36,721 --> 00:41:38,055
About Dad.

920
00:41:38,089 --> 00:41:39,590
What are you not telling me?

921
00:41:39,624 --> 00:41:41,992
What? Are you serious right now?

922
00:41:42,027 --> 00:41:45,396
You bring this up
on today, of all days?

923
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:48,899
I need a drink.
