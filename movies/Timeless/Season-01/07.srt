I was doing charity outreach.

522
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:52,517
Inner - City neighborhoods.

523
00:30:52,552 --> 00:30:54,719
Plucking out the best and brightest.

524
00:30:54,754 --> 00:30:56,581
Made me feel good.

525
00:30:57,723 --> 00:31:00,091
It made me look good too.

526
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:02,894
So we're at the science
fair in this run - Down,

527
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:05,530
gang - Infested Chicago middle school.

528
00:31:05,565 --> 00:31:07,599
The whole thing's pathetic, really,

529
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:10,902
but I see this scrawny, nerdy kid.

530
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:14,039
And he's got this scale
model of the entire city

531
00:31:14,065 --> 00:31:17,234
re - Engineered with a monorail system

532
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:20,045
that runs entirely on
recycled coffee pods.

533
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,646
Somehow, I'm not surprised.

534
00:31:21,681 --> 00:31:23,657
No, so, you know,
i invite him to talk to me

535
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:25,665
after the science fair,
and he knows who I am,

536
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,095
and he says, "No, no, sorry,
mr. Mason, I'd love to,

537
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,488
"but I can't be late
to pick up my brother."

538
00:31:30,523 --> 00:31:34,643
I think, "Wow, a genius with
a sense of responsibility."

539
00:31:34,861 --> 00:31:37,762
I thought, "He's gonna
do great things one day,

540
00:31:37,797 --> 00:31:41,633
"and when he does, I
want it to be for me."

<b>(MUSIC)</b>

542
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:47,572
First time I met Rufus,

543
00:31:47,607 --> 00:31:50,976
he saw the Tribble
that I got at Comic - Con,

544
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:54,179
and he told me that we
would never be friends

545
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:56,822
'cause I was "Star Trek"
and he was "Star Wars."

546
00:31:56,847 --> 00:31:58,109
Yeah, that sounds just like Rufus.

547
00:31:58,134 --> 00:32:02,040
He was always one who could
take awkward to bold new heights.

548
00:32:02,822 --> 00:32:04,964
You say it like he's gone.

549
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:08,979
Come on, I mean, any
minute, he's gonna be back,

550
00:32:09,004 --> 00:32:11,574
bragging about his
latest trip, you know,

551
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,823
what a hero he was.

552
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,634
Like Han Solo.

553
00:32:19,672 --> 00:32:21,237
What is it?

554
00:32:22,074 --> 00:32:24,745
I think I know what
Rufus is trying to say.

555
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:29,047
Now, there are a number of reasons

556
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:30,815
why they might not be back yet,

557
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,915
most of them really
bad, but let's just say

558
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,552
something happened to
the navigation system.

559
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:36,236
- Well, how do you know...
- I'm getting to that.

560
00:32:36,261 --> 00:32:38,857
If the nav system is down,

561
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:40,659
rufus is gonna need our
help with the landing.

562
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:42,627
I left specific
instructions... a series of code

563
00:32:42,662 --> 00:32:44,526
that detail how the
team at Mason Industries

564
00:32:44,551 --> 00:32:47,393
can take over and essentially
bring us home via remote control.

565
00:32:47,418 --> 00:32:49,339
Now, we won't be able
to do anything

566
00:32:49,364 --> 00:32:53,261
until it's in transit, so what
we need to do is catch him...

567
00:32:54,565 --> 00:32:55,993
mid - Jump,

568
00:32:56,242 --> 00:32:58,517
take over the controls,
and guide him in here.

569
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:00,175
It's an interesting theory, Jiya,

570
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,267
but how are you getting all
that from a few words in a note?

571
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:03,882
Because I filled in the blanks.

572
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:06,084
Rufus made an analogy to
a movie you might've seen.

573
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:07,237
It's like what the Death Star did...

574
00:33:07,262 --> 00:33:09,464
... to the Millennium Falcon.

575
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,784
That's what Rufus was trying to say.

576
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:14,392
And you can do that?

577
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,860
Maybe.

578
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:20,098
- But I'm gonna need help.
- So what are our options?

579
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:21,479
We stay here and fight off
the French

580
00:33:21,504 --> 00:33:24,136
or die of smallpox eventually?

581
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:25,361
Pretty much.

582
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:28,139
Likely death either way.

00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,709

not believe in my own fate?

696
00:40:16,356 --> 00:40:18,690
- Help me out here, Rufus.
- Don't look at me.

697
00:40:18,725 --> 00:40:21,218
My degrees are in
physics, not metaphysics.

698
00:40:22,328 --> 00:40:25,694
Look, we are in uncharted
water here.

699
00:40:29,268 --> 00:40:30,836
Have a drink.

700
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:34,506
Humor me.

701
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,174
Okay.

702
00:40:40,046 --> 00:40:44,216
Okay. Now, did you
decide to take that drink,

703
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:47,007
or was it pre - Written,

704
00:40:47,454 --> 00:40:51,124
some kind of history that says
you were meant to take that drink?

705
00:40:52,091 --> 00:40:54,093
You made the choice, Lucy.

706
00:40:54,527 --> 00:40:56,094
And that's what history is.

707
00:40:56,129 --> 00:40:58,830
Right? It's choices.

708
00:40:58,865 --> 00:41:02,267
Some small, stupid,
some monumental.

709
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,737
But we make them.

710
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,904
So if you're not happy
with the history

711
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:13,382
that Flynn has predicted for you,

712
00:41:14,914 --> 00:41:16,749
then rewrite it.
