- With what?
- He knows things about me.

- Wyatt!

it is he wants,

367
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,852

it was all different.

I really don't.

Never.

i'd always wonder.

449
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:40,877
He's working with Flynn?

450
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:42,178
Yeah, but you got to understand.

451
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,846
Anthony would never hurt anyone.

The name Christy Pitt
mean anything to you?

00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,508
- Never heard of her.
- Rufus, find out who she is.

460
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,144
Meantime, we're not gonna find Flynn.

461
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:16,412
Flynn's gonna find you.

00:21:16,414 --> 00:21:18,648
I'll take you back

which he will, sooner or later,

i'm gonna take him out.

465
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,921
- You want to use her as bait?
- He's not gonna hurt her.

466
00:21:24,923 --> 00:21:28,824
He needs her for
whatever he needs her for.

this is our best plan?

Yeah, they're yours.

00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:40,303
I need a word.

We can't risk it.

472
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,877
She's too important
to JFK and to history.

476
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:54,183
- This is not a game.
- I agree.

477
00:21:54,185 --> 00:21:56,285
Flynn wants to wipe out everything,

478
00:21:56,287 --> 00:21:57,753
so if we have a shot
at him, we take it.

479

Kept history the same.

715
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:39,795
But Garcia Flynn is still alive,

716
00:35:39,797 --> 00:35:41,864
and he got away with an atomic bomb.

717
00:35:41,866 --> 00:35:43,565
The situation was chaotic.

718
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:46,568
On the upside, we're finally
starting to gel as a team.

719
00:35:48,873 --> 00:35:50,382
Just saying.

720
00:35:50,407 --> 00:35:52,797
And you believe that
Anthony is working with Flynn?

721
00:35:52,822 --> 00:35:53,977
I think it's complicated.

722
00:35:54,002 --> 00:35:55,978
There's got to be
an explanation as to why.

723
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,246
Anthony's not the type of guy

724
00:35:57,248 --> 00:35:58,614
that would do something like that.

725
00:35:58,616 --> 00:36:00,482
They never are on the surface.

726
00:36:00,484 --> 00:36:03,585
Well, makes one part of our job easier.

727
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,388
We don't have to rescue
Anthony Bruhl anymore.

728
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,622
We just need to eliminate him.

729
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:09,124
Leave Flynn without anyone
to pilot the Mothership.

730
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:10,993
That crossed my mind.

731
00:36:10,995 --> 00:36:13,862
And in this gun battle, did you
ever get a shot at Anthony?

732
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:16,932
Never a clean shot.

733
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:19,201
Next time, make sure you do.

- Yeah?

736

You found the Mothership
in Vegas in the past.

737
00:36:30,114 --> 00:36:32,181
Do you think you might
be able to track her down

738
00:36:32,183 --> 00:36:33,649
in the present?

739
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:35,451
Probably, but it'll take some time.

740
00:36:35,453 --> 00:36:37,486

Okay, those are four
terrifying words.

752
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:41,817
I met this woman today,

753
00:37:41,819 --> 00:37:46,755
and she seemed like
she had it all together,

754
00:37:46,757 --> 00:37:51,193
but the truth is that she didn't.

755
00:37:51,195 --> 00:37:55,230

758
00:37:58,536 --> 00:38:00,536
And it's okay.

759
00:38:00,538 --> 00:38:05,741
A lot has changed recently at work,

760
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:11,180
and I need to get my head straight,

761
00:38:11,182 --> 00:38:12,781

gonna be able to do that
