<i>We need to get the doc back.</i>

178
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,230
<i>We need to get
the doc back now.</i>

179
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:23,232
<i>- And if we can't?
- I'm done.</i>

180
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:25,800
<i>They'll see to that.
Not just with the presidency,</i>

181
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,670
<i>but with my wife, with my girls.</i>

182
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,805
<i>Rittenhouse plays

<i>Do you understand who they are?
How deep I'm in with Rit...</i>

184
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:41,519
Did you hear what President
Nixon just said, Lucy?

185
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,586
I'm sorry. I didn't hear that.

186
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,321
Rittenhouse.

187
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,491
I guess it's not so much
my paranoid delusion anymore,

188
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,695
is it?

189
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:56,396
This document Nixon wants...

190
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:58,064
I don't know anything about it.

191
00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:00,500
I don't know what he's
talking about, okay?

192
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:03,203
I believe you.

193
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,506
I even looked in here.
I couldn't find anything

194
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:08,041
about this document.

195
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:09,409
What's that?

196
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:11,109
Oh, this is Lucy's journal.

197
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:14,079
What... she never told you about it?

198
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:15,847
- What's he talking about?
- I didn't write it.

199
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:17,015
Well, It's complicated.

200
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,850
You see, she's going to write it

201
00:09:18,855 --> 00:09:21,119
- A few years from now.
- What?

202
00:09:21,124 --> 00:09:23,889
I know. Time travel, right? Pew!

203
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:25,524
It's my guide.

204
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:29,194
Apparently, she and I are gonna
be quite the team one day.

205
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:31,128
It's not real. It's a fake.

206
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:32,730
Lucy, we've talked about this.

207
00:09:32,735 --> 00:09:34,765
You even admitted it's
your own handwriting.

208
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,068
No. I said it looked like
my handwriting,

209
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:38,769
not that I ever wrote it
or ever will.

210
00:09:38,774 --> 00:09:42,240
But you did talk to Flynn? When?

211
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:45,609
Ooh, let's see.
At the train station in 1865.

212
00:09:45,614 --> 00:09:48,212
The Nazi castle in Germany.

213
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:50,747
Lucy, what have you
told them about us?

214
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:53,550
Is that true?

215
00:09:53,555 --> 00:09:55,085
It's complicated.

216
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,788
No. The truth is not complicated.

217
00:09:58,793 --> 00:10:00,757
I don't know
what the truth is anymore.

218
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:05,328
Okay, the truth is she
didn't believe in Rittenhouse

219
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,631
until President Nixon just confirmed it.

220
00:10:08,636 --> 00:10:11,967
But for now, If Rittenhouse wants
this document so badly,

221
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:13,603
whatever it is,

222
00:10:13,608 --> 00:10:14,970
i want it first.

223
00:10:14,975 --> 00:10:16,606
How are we supposed to find it?

224
00:10:16,611 --> 00:10:18,806
If there's one thing you've proven,

225
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:20,645
it's your resourcefulness.

226
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:28,853
You'll find a way.

227
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,022
Ugh.

228
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:36,657
If you don't bring me the
document in five hours...

229
00:10:36,662 --> 00:10:39,660
You'll kill me?
Why don't you do it now,

230
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:40,997
save everyone some time?

231
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:43,664
It's up to you.

232
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:45,165
Go straight to the Lifeboat.

233
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,970
Screw Flynn. Do not
give him what he wants.

234
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,938
Five hours. Don't hurt him.

235
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,308
Lucy. Lucy, damn it, listen to me!

236
00:10:55,313 --> 00:10:56,945
Don't! Lucy!

237
00:10:58,215 --> 00:10:59,845
This is bad. This is very bad.

238
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,547
How could you not tell me
and Wyatt about the journal?

239
00:11:01,552 --> 00:11:03,115
- It's not real.
- You don't know that.

240
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,717
Not with all the mind - Trippy
crap going on around here.

241
00:11:04,722 --> 00:11:06,051
- Rufus...
- Lucy, If it is,

242
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:07,687
who knows what Flynn knows about us.

243
00:11:07,692 --> 00:11:09,021
Maybe we're playing into
his hands right now.

244
00:11:09,026 --> 00:11:10,555
You don't think
we deserve to know that?

245
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,056
I wasn't trying
to keep anything from...

246
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:13,825
- Our jobs are dangerous enough!
- I'm sorry!

247
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,460
I should have told you.

248
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:17,162
But, God, Rufus, It can't be real,

249
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:19,798
because, I mean, If it is,
the things that it says

250
00:11:19,803 --> 00:11:21,503
that I'm going to do...

251
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:26,004
Have you ever had
a secret that just...

252
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:29,540
scared the living hell out of you?

253
00:11:29,545 --> 00:11:33,647
Now, please, can we just...
Can we just save Wyatt?

254
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:40,150
What about the documents?
How do we even start?

255
00:11:40,155 --> 00:11:42,553
We know they're
connected to Watergate.

256
00:11:42,558 --> 00:11:44,220
I have an idea.

257
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:47,223
You remember how
to use a payphone?

258
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:50,092
We'll call every William
M. Felt in the D. C. Area

259
00:11:50,097 --> 00:11:51,528
until we find Mark Felt.

260
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:53,029
Mark Felt? Who's that?

261
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:55,832
Mark Felt. Deep Throat.
Secret informant.

262
00:11:55,837 --> 00:11:57,099
"Follow the money"? Deep Throat?

263
00:11:57,104 --> 00:11:59,235
- I know the porn one.
- Seriously?

264
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,036
He was Associate Director
of the FBI,

265
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,571
and Deep Throat
was his cover name.

266
00:12:02,576 --> 00:12:04,673
He tips off two reporters,
woodward and Bernstein,

267
00:12:04,678 --> 00:12:05,674
about Watergate,

268
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,509
breaks open the entire case.

269
00:12:07,514 --> 00:12:10,111
If anybody knows about
this document, It'll be him.

270
00:12:10,116 --> 00:12:11,580
If he's such a secret informant,

271
00:12:11,585 --> 00:12:13,215
what makes you think
he's gonna talk to us?

272
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,551
Because except for
Woodward and Bernstein,

273
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:17,685
nobody knows his identity
for 30 years.

274
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,886

We didn't have a chance
to stop him.

Nixon was on it. He sounded
terrified about Rittenhouse,

285
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:48,585
mentioned something
about a document.

298
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,624
Actually, no. We wanted to ask you

00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:35,492
about the Watergate Hotel break - In.

300
00:13:35,497 --> 00:13:38,529
No. I only came... i don't know
anything about the Watergate.

Yes, you do.

302
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:41,632
You talked to Bob Woodward
at the "Washington Post"

303
00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:43,165
about it just yesterday.

304
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,267

who plays by the same
rules as everyone else.

310
00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:57,713
Now is that too much to ask?

311
00:13:57,718 --> 00:13:59,181

anything at the hotel?

- Was anything written on it?
- Nothing written.

00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:43,749
Not a routine, Wyatt.

352
00:15:45,953 --> 00:15:48,116
We're two grunts in the same war.

353
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:51,286
The only difference is, lately,

354
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,756
you're fighting on the wrong side.

355
00:15:53,761 --> 00:15:55,658
I just wish you could
understand that.

356
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,427
Well, make me understand.

357
00:15:58,432 --> 00:16:00,662
No, no, no... i'm serious.

358
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:03,364
We're just sitting here.

359
00:16:03,369 --> 00:16:06,534
Two grunts, right? So...

360
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:09,637
explain to me how you're not
just some creepy sociopath.

361
00:16:09,642 --> 00:16:13,507
I've got nothing to hide.
Not like Lucy.

362
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:16,977
Two years ago,
my old pals at the NSA

363
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:21,181
outsourced some surveillance
to a group I worked with.

364
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:23,951
Wanted it off the books.
Standard stuff.

365
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:26,887
Evade security, retrieve and review

366
00:16:26,892 --> 00:16:28,321
some corporate financials.

367
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:31,658
- Mm, thrilling.
- Well, not until I stumbled

368
00:16:31,663 --> 00:16:35,394
onto huge sums of money being
funneled through the Caymans

369
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,198
to a world - Renowned tech
mogul, Connor Mason,

370
00:16:39,203 --> 00:16:41,634
to help him achieve
his latest ambition:

371
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,235
time travel.

372
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,472
Is that so?

373
00:16:46,477 --> 00:16:47,539
Where'd the money come from?

374
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:49,241
Hard to tell.

375
00:16:49,246 --> 00:16:53,177
But once I broke the encryption,
one name kept popping up.

376
00:16:53,182 --> 00:16:54,846
Rittenhouse.

377
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:58,016
That's right. Rittenhouse
bankrolls Connor Mason.

378
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:04,558
So, I flagged these transfers
to my NSA contact, and, uh...

379
00:17:06,729 --> 00:17:08,425
he said he'd take care of it.

380
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,860
But he didn't?

381
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:12,429
Oh, but he did.

382
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:15,265
Um,

383
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:21,505
four nights later, I'm home
asleep when my wife gets up

384
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,540
in the middle of the night

385
00:17:23,545 --> 00:17:25,174
to go check on our little girl.

386
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:28,014
She thought
she heard her coughing.

387
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,117
We call them silencers,

388
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:36,122
but they're not that silent.

389
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,258
Not at night. Not when it's two
shots murdering your family.

390
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,030
You didn't fight back?

391
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,432
There were too many of them.

392
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,136
It was dark.
The bullets were flying.

393
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:56,872
I barely made it out alive,

394
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:59,206
and then Rittenhouse
framed me for all of it,

395
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,775
and I found myself on the run.

396
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,915
But it was all Rittenhouse.

397
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,785
Just because
I asked a single question.

398
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,489
And that's who they are.

399
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,991
Look. If any of this were true,

400
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,894
you have a time machine.

401
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,730
Why don't you just go
back and save your family?

402
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,768
Like how you want
to save your wife?

403
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:28,768
You know the rules
as well as I do.

404
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:30,904
Can't go back to any
time I already exist.

405
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,573
And since I don't know who
put the hit out to begin with,

406
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:38,980
i'm gonna just wipe
Rittenhouse from the map.

407
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,481
And once I do,

408
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:45,117
who knows?

409
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:46,451
Maybe one day I'll come back

410
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:50,424
and my girls will be there again.

417
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,180
Positive. It's an obscure
BLA calling card.

418
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,607
See? Right there.

419
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:15,750

I mean,

422
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,887
i don't even know this stuff.

423
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,388
Gregory Hayes and Eldridge Cleaver,

424
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,190
the founder of the BLA...

425
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,059
I've read everything
about these guys.

426
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,526
Kind of went through
a militant phase

427
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:28,195
- Back in college.
- Really?

428
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,797
Yeah. As in I had a militant crush

429
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:30,797
on a militant girl.

430
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,398
Ah.

431
00:19:32,403 --> 00:19:34,267
If this document is at
all linked to the BLA,

432
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:36,205
gregory Hayes should know about it.

433
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:45,278
You should probably wait outside.

434
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:49,084

just don't make any eye contact.

You do that, and you'll be
making a hell of a mistake.

447
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:40,595
Now, I need to talk to
Gregory about the Watergate

448

Oh, no... sir?

Can I just... i...

454
00:20:56,983 --> 00:20:58,880
Yeah. Okay.

455
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:00,481
I'm good.

456
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:03,617

I know anything about any doc?

457
00:21:03,622 --> 00:21:05,048
What are you accusing me of?

458
00:21:05,073 --> 00:21:06,888
No, I am not accusing you of
anything, Mr. Hayes.

459
00:21:06,893 --> 00:21:08,556
- Stop calling me Mr. Hayes.
- Sorry.

460
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:10,194
Stop apologizing, Kanye.

461
00:21:11,397 --> 00:21:14,027
Y'all ever hear a name like Kanye?

462
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:15,062
Sounds made up.

463
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,730
- You a fed?
- No way.

464
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,631
- Talks like a fed. Walks like a fed.

465
00:21:18,636 --> 00:21:21,668
No. I am not a fed.

466
00:21:21,673 --> 00:21:24,171
Right. Like you would just admit it.

Five seconds. Four.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay.

470
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:34,716
Wait.

471
00:21:37,188 --> 00:21:38,417
I'm here for Cleaver.

472
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,219
- Eldridge?
- Eldridge Cleaver.

The man we all work for.

474
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:43,990
He wants the doc.

475
00:21:43,995 --> 00:21:45,424
I ain't talk to him
in eight months.

476
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,558
That's cause he's been
laying low.

477
00:21:47,563 --> 00:21:49,094
He's in exile, so he sent me.

478
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,495
Man, that's some first - Rate...

479
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,897
He said, "Gregory
is my best friend.

480
00:21:51,902 --> 00:21:53,265
He'll do anything to help you."

481
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,401
I've known Cleaver
since we were peas,

482
00:21:56,406 --> 00:21:58,703
and he ain't never asked me
to help him.

483
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,105
Not once.

484
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,073
You don't know Cleaver.
Get him out of here.

485
00:22:02,078 --> 00:22:04,074
No, no, wait, wait, wait.
I don't know Cleaver?

486
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,276
Okay, you guys used
to work together

487
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:06,610
back in the Oakland days, right?

488
00:22:06,615 --> 00:22:07,912

make you watch

How he beat your ass in Harlem.
Remember that?

492
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:18,088
You made him promise
not to tell anybody.

493
00:22:18,093 --> 00:22:19,356
Well, he told me.

494
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:24,964
So, do I know Cleaver or not?

495
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:31,867

Yeah. Lucy's the one
that sounds crazy.

515
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:22,648

00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,129
You were out with Jessica.
That's her name, right?

You drank too much.
