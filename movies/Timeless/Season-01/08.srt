893
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:44,839
- Singlehandedly.
- Well, that's what it says.

"... thwarting a Communist

895
00:39:50,268 --> 00:39:52,164
So history mostly stayed the same.

For Katherine, looks like
it changed for the better.

897
00:39:55,573 --> 00:39:57,874
They made her the first
female flight director.

898
00:39:57,909 --> 00:39:59,592
Even made a movie about her.

899
00:39:59,617 --> 00:40:02,328
Looks like things worked out okay.

900
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,247
What about you?

00:40:04,282 --> 00:40:05,749
Hmm?

Yeah. Fine.

Rufus, with what happened earlier today,

905
00:40:13,814 --> 00:40:14,945
you didn't have a choice.

906
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,836
- It was self - Defense.
- Yeah, I know.

907
00:40:17,492 --> 00:40:19,096
I'm fine.

That's the problem.

Wh... what do you mean?

912

I killed a man, and I feel fine.

913
00:40:30,441 --> 00:40:34,063
I really don't feel much of anything.

914
00:40:34,245 --> 00:40:36,947
I'd do it again, probably shoot Anthony.

Flynn wouldn't have a pilot, and
we can go back to our normal lives.

When I first started all this,

i was, um... scared as hell,

920
00:40:56,674 --> 00:40:58,474
practically afraid of my own shadow.
